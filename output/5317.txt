[[[About Aviva]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Aviva provides peace of mind for more than 34 million people across the world, protecting their families and possessions by providing insurance, savings and investment products.  &#xa0;Aviva insures about 400,000 vehicles under Commercial Motor Fleet contracts. We are committed to protecting our customers in order to build a stronger, sustainable business, which makes a positive contribution to society, and for which our people are proud to work.&#xa0;

[[[Introduction]]]&#xa0;Aviva is supportive of initiatives that preserve life or prevent injury. Aviva is also committed to recognising good standards of risk management and assist our policyholders to achieve these goals by employing a nationwide team of Fleet Risk Consultants. These individuals help customers to identify key hazards, then provide information, guidance and practical solutions to eliminate or minimise the associated risks.  &#xa0;Aviva is also currently working with the road safety charity BRAKE, to produce a specific VRU focused information leaflet designed to raise awareness and promote risk management best practice. &#xa0;Over recent years, Aviva has witnessed a significant rise in the frequency of claims involving cyclists under our Commercial Motor Fleet account, which is up 64% across 2011/12 compared with the 2008-10 average (see graph below). It is also apparent in our data, that Large Goods Vehicles (particularly construction vehicles) are commonly involved, very often as the vehicle turns left at a junction.&#xa0;&#xa0;I hope the following thoughts provide some assistance to the Transport Select Committee and I am happy to supply further comment if more detail or information is required.

[[[Q1 ]]]

[[[Is cycling safe, particularly in towns and cities?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.  This is a matter of perception. Aviva recognises that a great deal of Government resource has already been invested and this has undoubtedly resulted in the advancement of cycling safety. However, comparisons with other countries suggest there is still considerable scope for further improvement in the UK.&#xa0;

[[[Q2 ]]]

[[[What could central and local government do to improve cycling safety?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.  There have been many debates and consultations on such matters and so Aviva will restrict comment to the following points, where it is felt we can add useful insight.  &#xa0;3.  In Aviva’s experience, most serious collisions between a motorist and a cyclist involve the driver simply not seeing the cyclist before impact. They tend to occur at junctions and roundabouts. Rarely is the driver blatantly reckless and invariably they are mortified by what has happened. &#xa0;4.  Aviva believes that to effectively tackle this type of occurrence, the issues and consequences need to be embedded in the public psyche and that this is probably best achieved by raising awareness via a ‘hard hitting’ communication campaign. Certainly this should utilise TV and printed advertising, but also other forms of social media. The adverts should aim to have a similar gravitas to those previously used to encourage seat belt usage and to look twice for oncoming motorcyclists. Whilst commendable, the current THINK! ‘Look Out’ for cyclists’ campaign does not seem to have a great deal of supporting video, nor has it achieved sufficiently high profile yet.&#xa0;5.  A nationwide advert would provide an opportunity to demonstrate benefits such as cyclists wearing a helmet / hi-viz clothing, warn about the dangers of under-taking / use of ear phones and promote the availability of any free / low cost cycling training schemes (themes preferably to be agreed in advance with recognised cycling associations such as the CTC &amp; LCC). &#xa0;6.  Specifically in relation to collisions involving LGVs / Construction Vehicles turning left at a junction, Aviva is supportive of the recently produced Construction Logistics Standard, which we feel represents good practice and would encourage operators / clients to build this into their procurement process. &#xa0;7.  Transport for London’s Fleet Operator Recognition Scheme (FORS) is another excellent initiative, of which Aviva is supportive, and it is felt should be publicised and extended to other regions as quickly as possible.&#xa0;8.  Aviva currently offers to fund the cost of supplying our Fleet LGV customers with warning decals (illustrated below) and Fresnel lenses. We consider this to be a cost effective means to raise both cyclist awareness and to improve the driver’s field of vision respectively. This initiative has received widespread praise and Government might like to consider making the distinctive / intuitive decal in particular, freely available to a wider audience, perhaps via FORS.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;9.   Aviva is of the view that all professional drivers should complete a Vulnerable Road User focused module as part of their mandatory Driver CPC training, preferably to include physically experiencing things from the perspective of a cyclist.   &#xa0;

[[[Q3 ]]]

[[[Is it desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from other road]]]

[[[ users, for example by ]]]

[[[prohibiting HGVs from entering city centres at peak hours?]]]&#xa0;10.  Following a review of killed and seriously injured cyclist claims on our Commercial Motor account, Aviva is believes that the most effective means to protect cyclists is to physically separate them from other road users. Wherever this is possible, such segregation will also substantially remove the sources of antagonism that otherwise inevitably arise between the two factions.  &#xa0;11. In London at least, Police data confirms that most incidents involving cyclists occur during peak commuter times. With this in mind, Aviva believes there is justification to at least explore the prospect of restricting access to certain road networks for some vehicles during certain times of the day. The matter is of course complicated by the number of different stakeholders involved and the risk of unintended consequences. Perhaps there is scope to undertake a limited trial &amp;/or introduce measures only for vehicles which do not meet stipulated safety standards as a means to encourage greater compliance.&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;              Page 1 of 3
