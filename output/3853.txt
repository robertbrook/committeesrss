[[[Costs and the combined effect of these proposals and those relating to legal ]]]

[[[aid for prisone]]]

[[[rs ]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;“But it seems to me that the courts, and through them the law and the constitution, get a great deal of help from the people and organisations who bring proceedings or intervene in the public interest.”

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;

[[[Procedural ]]]

[[[as opposed to substantive defects in decision-making]]]“There is no doubt that one of the virtues of procedurally fair decision-making is that it is liable to result in better decisions, by ensuring that the decision-maker receives all relevant information and that it is properly tested…. the purpose of a fair hearing is not merely to improve the chances of the tribunal reaching the right decision. At least two other important values are also engaged.”
