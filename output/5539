[normal]Written evidence[bold] submitted by [bold]the [bold]National Trust[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Executive summary[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1. 
[normal]National Trust is a major landowner in 
[normal]England
[normal], 
[normal]Wales
[normal] and 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] with 255,000 h
[normal]ect
[normal]a
[normal]res (ha) of countryside, 
[normal]700 k
[normal]ilo
[normal]m
[normal]etres
[normal] of coastline and 400 gardens in our care for the benefit of the nation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. Approximately half 
[normal]of this land is of h
[normal]igh nature value, accessible and  
[normal] enjoyed by million
[normal]s of people. Together with tenanted farmland, it makes a significant contribution to 
[normal]local 
[normal]and regional 
[normal]economies. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. We recognise the harm caused by
[normal] 
[normal]Invasive Non-Native Species (
[normal]IN
[normal]NS) - be they plant diseases in
[normal] gardens
[normal] and woodlands, plants in water bodies or predatory mammals on seabird 
[normal]islands. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. We recognise the value of both 
[normal]effective quarantine measures
[normal],
[normal] and rapid reaction to control and eradicate INNS inclu
[normal]ding plant diseases
[normal]. 
[normal] O
[normal]ur 
[normal]staff can spend up to half of their time
[normal] controlling invasive species
[normal],
[normal] at a cost of up to £12000 per h
[normal]a depending on the situation
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. 
[normal]The draft EU Directive proposal to list 50 INNS is not sufficiently sensitive to existing risk from species and those 
[normal]native species 
[normal]that are poise
[normal]d
[normal] to cause harm in areas 
[normal]of the EU where they are not native. More emphasis should be based on risk-
[normal]base
[normal]d assessments that identify species 
[normal]of most 
[normal]concern and provide the basis for risk-
[normal]based trading.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. 
[normal]The Invasive Non-Native
[normal] 
[normal]Species Framework Strategy
[normal]for Great Britain
[normal] (GB INNS Framework), 
[normal]in 
[normal]promoting sound 
[normal]management
[normal] of INNS, could help define what success looks like, promote more effective engagement with NGOs, and forge more citizen science and state agency based partnerships.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7. The Scottish INNS legislation looks promising, as do initiatives in 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] and the 
[normal]Republic
[normal] of 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] to tackle INNS on an island –wide basis.

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1. [bold]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1.  
[normal]The National Trust welcomes the opportunity to provide evidence to the Environmental Audit Committee’s inquiry on Invasive Species.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2. 
[normal]The National Trust is 
[normal]Europe
[normal]’s largest conservation charity with over 4 million members and an annual turnover of more than £430 million. We currently manage over 250,000 ha of countryside, several hundred historic houses, gardens and parks and more than 700 km of coastline across 
[normal]England
[normal], 
[normal]Wales
[normal] and 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal]. Nearly 50 % of the water in 
[normal]England
[normal] and 
[normal]Wales
[normal] runs through National Trust land.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3 
[normal]The National Trust exists to look after special places for ever, for everyone. We do this in a way which connects 
[normal]the
[normal] benefits 
[normal]of nature 
[normal]with people, welcoming around 100 million visits to the outdoors, coast and countryside locations managed by the National Trust. We invest over £130m into conservation projects each year, and some of this funding comes from corporate partners. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4. 
[normal]Management of invasive species is a major investment in 
[normal]resource
[normal] for the Trust. Typically our countryside a
[normal]nd gardens staff spend up to half 
[normal]of their time reducing the impacts of invasive species and plant diseases, most of which are non-native.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5 
[normal]We welcome the Committee’s interest in the degree to which the 
[normal]UK
[normal] should align with EU initiatives, look to legislation in 
[normal]Scotland
[normal] as a guide, and help shape the G
[normal]B INNS Framework of the future.

[normal]2. [bold]Overview[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1 Invasive Non Native Species (INN
[normal]S
[normal])
[normal] are a major threat to the 
[normal]UK
[normal]’s native wildlife and its economy. They also have adverse societal impacts 
[normal]which include the profound sense of loss of
[normal] iconic and beautiful native species such as the red squirrel 
[normal](which can 
[normal]cont
[normal]r
[normal]act and die from disease spread by the non-native grey squirrel
[normal])
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2 
[normal]Programmes 
[normal]to tackle INNS 
[normal]in which we are especially active, often in partnership with other organisations and with the help of hundreds of volunteers, include: 
[normal](1)  Control of 
[normal]Hottentot
[normal] fig from coastal slopes in 
[normal]Cornwall
[normal] (
[normal]to win back flower rich grassland and restore feeding places for the recently re-established chough, the county’s 
[normal]emblemic
[normal] bird
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal](2) Control of 
[normal]Rhododendron
[normal] in north 
[normal]Wales
[normal] and north Devon to restore oak woodland, and its native bird and lichen species
[normal], and on 
[normal]Brownsea
[normal] and 
[normal]Lundy
[normal] 
[normal]Islands
[normal], to restore habitat for the red squirrel and Lundy cabbage respectively. 
[normal] 
[normal](3) Eradication of rats from 
[normal]Lundy
[normal] 
[normal]Island
[normal] to save 
[normal]species such as the Manx shearwater 
[normal]from extinction there
[normal]. 
[normal](4
[normal]) Control of grey squirrels in and around refuge areas for red squirrels in the north of 
[normal]England
[normal] and on 
[normal]Anglesey
[normal]. 
[normal](5
[normal]) Control of non-native aquatic (e.g. 
[normal]New Zealand
[normal] pygmy weed) and 
[normal]bankside
[normal] plants (such as Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam) in and around our thousands of ponds and other water bodies 
[normal](6
[normal]) Plant health and 
[normal]biosecurity
[normal] in our heritage gardens. 
[normal]We have a rigour programme of deploying 
[normal]biosecurity
[normal] to minimise the risk of plant diseases damaging high value plants and destroying the beauty of our nationally important gardens.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3 
[normal]Rigorous prioritisation based on risk
[normal] assessment is critical
[normal]. Early intervention and the resources need
[normal]ed for this are equally 
[normal]critical, especially where non-native invasive species have been tracked and found to be established in satellite areas. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3. [bold]Our concerns[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1 
[normal]The 
[normal]future of the 
[normal]Defra GB INNS Programme Board
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The GB INNS Programme Board represents an 
[normal]important commitment by the 
[normal]UK
[normal] to reduce the damaging influence
[normal] of non-native species
[normal], and it should be maintained
[normal]. But it nee
[normal]ds more resource to engage with people 
[normal]to be vigilant, 
[normal]to 
[normal]exert stricter quarantine measures, control and eradicate some species at an appropriate scale, define success and report on success or failure.
[normal] The Board also 
[normal]needs to prioritise high risk species – these are the small suite of non-native invasive species that have the highest capacity to transform 
[normal]native 
[normal]habitats and ecosystems. 
[normal] In some cases the Board needs to stimulate research where there are significant knowledge gaps. The two examples below illustrate the need to act now on (1) a high risk species not yet established in the 
[normal]UK
[normal]; and (2) on one which is established but spreading and whose ecological impact is not well understood.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](1) Water hyacinth, native to 
[normal]South America
[normal], is a major pest of water bodies, making them 
[normal]unnavigable
[normal] and reducing their biodiversity. This species does not breed in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] yet, but could do so in a series of warmer weather years. We need a formal watching brief backed by a rapid response mechanism to ensure that water hyacinth does not become established in the 
[normal]UK
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](2) Chinese water deer, 
[normal]established in the east of 
[normal]England
[normal], has recently invaded 
[normal]Orford
[normal] Ness
[normal], a 15 km long shingle spit off the 
[normal]Suffolk
[normal] coast that is 
[normal]internationally important fo
[normal]r its wildlife and 
[normal]historical heritag
[normal]e. 
[normal]We do not 
[normal]know 
[normal]the impact of Chinese water deer on either the natural or cultural or historical features on 
[normal]Orford
[normal] Ness
[normal] but remain concerned about this knowledge gap.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2 
[normal]Objective setting and realistic 
[normal]costings
[normal] for control/eradication of INNS
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the management of INNS 
[normal]success
[normal] is reported in a variety of ways
[normal]. It is 
[normal]in
[normal]sufficient for success to be gauged by how much 
[normal]of a INNS
[normal] has been removed. 
[normal]A better measure 
[normal]is if native species and habi
[normal]tats can be shown to have 
[normal]been restored
[normal], or ecosystem functioning improved
[normal] as a result of the 
[normal]management
[normal]. 
[normal]We should not be afraid to recognise failure but need to 
[normal]make sure effective communication is in place to report 
[normal]on 
[normal]what does not work.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3 
[normal]Increasing 
[normal]the 
[normal]use of innovative 
[normal]methods 
[normal]to 
[normal]detect
[normal] early stages of
[normal] 
[normal]establishment of INNS. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Government and others should make more use of innovative methods to detect the early stage of INNS establishment where these are practicable 
[normal]For example, hair tubes for mammals 
[normal]and collections of faeces 
[normal]from which DNA can be extracted to identify species and also individuals; e (environmental) DNA – which can be used to track presence of non-native invasive amphibians such as bullfrogs in ponds for example; camera
[normal] traps. Much of the data collection can be done by volunteers but would need coordinating with state agencies and analysing by scientists.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4 T
[normal]he minimum requirements for successful management 
[normal]of INNS
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The National Trust
[normal] sees the minimum requirements for successful management of INNS as:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4.1 
[normal]Realistic and appropriate prioritisation based on risk assessment for native wildlife, people and the economy
[normal]. This could lead to risk-
[normal]based trading of species such as 
[normal]INNS of 
[normal]aquatic plants
[normal]3.4.2 Consultation with local people leading to r
[normal]apid decision making leading to rapid action
[normal]3.4.3 
[normal]Action at the appropriate scale (e.g. 
[normal]for 
[normal]bankside
[normal] INNS plants such as Japanese knotweed,  whole water 
[normal]catchments rather than
[normal] just one 
[normal]part of the 
[normal]catchment where the species is known and conspicuous
[normal])
[normal]3.4.4 
[normal]Criteria for success agreed early in the project
[normal], and success/failure reported on at milestones and at the end of the project.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5 
[normal]Delivery mechanisms
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We see a m
[normal]ajor role for Local Nature Partnerships 
[normal]as delivery bodies 
[normal]to coordinate, communicate and stimulate state agency, local authority and 
[normal]volunteer partnerships to tackle INNS
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6 Legislation
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We advocate b
[normal]etter use of
[normal] powers in
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]W
[normal]ildlife 
[normal]&amp; C
[normal]ountryside
[normal] Act 1981 Schedu
[normal]le 9 and equivalent in 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] to raise awareness of the risks of unrestricted movement of certain species by human agency, and also learning from INNS legislation in 
[normal]Scotland
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7 Knowledge gaps
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We advocate m
[normal]ore research on ecological processes and pathogens transfer
[normal] between INNS and native species 
[normal](
[normal]non-native and native crayfish species;  grey/red squirrel - 
[normal]NT supporting the latter)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8 [bold]The Committee might want to consider the following[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8.
[normal]1. Is the EU draft Directive on Invasive Non – Native Species (INNS) fit for purpose? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Is 
[normal]the EU draft Directive’s s
[normal]election of 50 species deemed to cause most
[normal] harm
[normal] sufficiently sensitive –
[normal] or
[normal] would a risk-based
[normal] 
[normal]selection
[normal], using 
[normal]climate change scenario
[normal]s and/or 
[normal]horizon scanning be better at preventing spread
[normal] and 
[normal]establishment?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Will the EU Directive be sufficiently sensitive to th
[normal]e need to p
[normal]revent 
[normal]the
[normal] spread of potentially invasive species from EU Member states where 
[normal]they are either 
[normal]native
[normal] or 
[normal]long established to those where not yet established but where they could cause harm.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8.2. 
[normal] How do we prioritise (we cannot manage all INNS everywhere)? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We should focus on s
[normal]trengthen
[normal]ing
[normal] existing legislation
[normal]. The
[normal] Scottish model looks promising.
[normal] E
[normal]cological priorities
[normal] should be based
[normal] on global responsibilities
[normal], for example the
[normal] removal of rats from seabird islands. Societal and economic benefits from managing INNS may
[normal] however need to
[normal] be based on different priorities
[normal], for instance 
[normal]keeping new plant diseases out of publicly accessible heritage gardens, and clearing away Himalayan balsam to allow access to river banks by anglers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8.
[normal]3. How do we measure and report on success and failure? What does success look like?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Management needs to be lead by carefully constructed 
[normal]‘
[normal]smart
[normal]’
[normal] objectives. INNS 
[normal]can be regarded as successfully managed
[normal] when they have been prevented from invading the 
[normal]UK
[normal] through effective legislation and/or quarantine. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In some cases 
[normal]invading or established INNS may 
[normal]have been controlled successfully 
[normal]but the expected positive impacts such as evident restoration of native species and/or habitats
[normal] or wider 
[normal]societal or economic benefit may not have been measured. 
[normal]The f
[normal]ailure of management of INNS is rarely reported
[normal]. This may be
[normal] because objectives were poorly defined at the outset.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A s
[normal]trengthened GB INNS Framework Strategy 
[normal]could help to address this problem
[normal], especially if
[normal] it is
[normal] more inclusive of NGOs in decision making
[normal] and
[normal] includ
[normal]es
[normal] on appropriate application of the precautionary principle.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8.
[normal]4. Should there be a
[normal] UK/all 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] approach to management of INNS?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]INNSs do not respect international boundaries, especially when there is no sea barrier or obvious border control. It makes sense to support the strengthening of al 
[normal]UK
[normal]/ all 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] strategy to tackle INNS. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Again a strengthened GB INNS Framework Strat
[normal]egy has a supporting role here, as it does in promoting functional working links between Departments at state borders.
