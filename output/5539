defaultNational Trust is a major landowner in 
defaultEngland

default&#xa0;

defaultof this land is of h
defaultigh nature value, accessible and  
default enjoyed by million
defaults of people. Together with tenanted farmland, it makes a significant contribution to 
defaultlocal 
defaultand regional 
defaulteconomies. 
default&#xa0;
default3. We recognise the harm caused by
default 
defaultInvasive Non-Native Species (
defaultIN
defaultNS) - be they plant diseases in
default gardens
default and woodlands, plants in water bodies or predatory mammals on seabird 
defaultislands. 
default&#xa0;
default4. We recognise the value of both 
defaulteffective quarantine measures
default,
default and rapid reaction to control and eradicate INNS inclu

default. 
default O
defaultur 
defaultstaff can spend up to half of their time
default controlling invasive species
default,
default at a cost of up to £12000 per h
defaulta depending on the situation
default.  
default&#xa0;
default5. 
defaultThe draft EU Directive proposal to list 50 INNS is not sufficiently sensitive to existing risk from species and those 
defaultnative species 
defaultthat are poise
defaultd
default to cause harm in areas 
defaultof the EU where they are not native. More emphasis should be based on risk-
defaultbase
defaultd assessments that identify species 
defaultof most

defaultThe Invasive Non-Native
default 
defaultSpecies Framework Strategy
defaultfor Great Britain
default (GB INNS Framework), 
defaultin 
defaultpromoting sound 
defaultmanagement
default of INNS, could help define what success looks like, promote more effective engagement with NGOs, and forge more citizen science and state agency based partnerships.
default&#xa0;

defaultNorthern Ireland
default and the 
defaultRepublic

default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default1. defaultIntroductiondefault&#xa0;
default1.1.  
defaultThe National Trust welcomes the opportunity to provide evidence to the Environmental Audit Committee’s inquiry on Invasive Species.
default&#xa0;
default1.2. 
defaultThe National Trust is 
defaultEurope
default’s largest conservation charity with over 4 million members and an annual turnover of more than £430 million. We currently manage over 250,000 ha of countryside, several hundred historic houses, gardens and parks and more than 700 km of coastline across 
defaultEngland
default, 
defaultWales
default and 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default. Nearly 50 % of the water in 
defaultEngland
default and 
defaultWales
default runs through National Trust land.
default&#xa0;
default1.3 
defaultThe National Trust exists to look after special places for ever, for everyone. We do this in a way which connects 
defaultthe
default benefits 
defaultof nature 
defaultwith people, welcoming around 100 million visits to the outdoors, coast and countryside locations managed by the National Trust. We invest over £130m into conservation projects each year, and some of this funding comes from corporate partners. 
default&#xa0;
default1.4. 
defaultManagement of invasive species is a major investment in 
defaultresource
default for the Trust. Typically our countryside a
defaultnd gardens staff spend up to half 
defaultof their time reducing the impacts of invasive species and plant diseases, most of which are non-native.
default&#xa0;
default1.5 
defaultWe welcome the Committee’s interest in the degree to which the 
defaultUK
default should align with EU initiatives, look to legislation in 
defaultScotland
default as a guide, and help shape the G
defaultB INNS Framework of the future.

default2. defaultOverviewdefault&#xa0;
default2.1 Invasive Non Native Species (INN
defaultS
default)
default are a major threat to the 
defaultUK
default’s native wildlife and its economy. They also have adverse societal impacts 
defaultwhich include the profound sense of loss of
default iconic and beautiful native species such as the red squirrel 
default(which can 
defaultcont
defaultr
defaultact and die from disease spread by the non-native grey squirrel
default)
default. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2 
defaultProgrammes 
defaultto tackle INNS 
defaultin which we are especially active, often in partnership with other organisations and with the help of hundreds of volunteers, include: 
default(1)  Control of 
defaultHottentot
default fig from coastal slopes in 
defaultCornwall
default (
defaultto win back flower rich grassland and restore feeding places for the recently re-established chough, the county’s 
defaultemblemic
default bird
default)
default 
default(2) Control of 
defaultRhododendron
default in north 
defaultWales
default and north Devon to restore oak woodland, and its native bird and lichen species
default, and on 
defaultBrownsea
default and 
defaultLundy
default 
defaultIslands
default, to restore habitat for the red squirrel and Lundy cabbage respectively. 
default 
default(3) Eradication of rats from 
defaultLundy
default 
defaultIsland
default to save 
defaultspecies such as the Manx shearwater 
defaultfrom extinction there
default. 
default(4
default) Control of grey squirrels in and around refuge areas for red squirrels in the north of 
defaultEngland
default and on 
defaultAnglesey
default. 
default(5
default) Control of non-native aquatic (e.g. 
defaultNew Zealand
default pygmy weed) and 
defaultbankside
default plants (such as Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam) in and around our thousands of ponds and other water bodies 
default(6
default) Plant health and 
defaultbiosecurity
default in our heritage gardens. 
defaultWe have a rigour programme of deploying 
defaultbiosecurity
default to minimise the risk of plant diseases damaging high value plants and destroying the beauty of our nationally important gardens.
default&#xa0;
default2.3 
defaultRigorous prioritisation based on risk
default assessment is critical
default. Early intervention and the resources need
defaulted for this are equally 
defaultcritical, especially where non-native invasive species have been tracked and found to be established in satellite areas. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default3. defaultOur concernsdefault&#xa0;
default3.1 
defaultThe 
defaultfuture of the 
defaultDefra GB INNS Programme Board
default&#xa0;
defaultThe GB INNS Programme Board represents an 
defaultimportant commitment by the 
defaultUK
default to reduce the damaging influence
default of non-native species
default, and it should be maintained
default. But it nee
defaultds more resource to engage with people 
defaultto be vigilant, 
defaultto 
defaultexert stricter quarantine measures, control and eradicate some species at an appropriate scale, define success and report on success or failure.
default The Board also 
defaultneeds to prioritise high risk species – these are the small suite of non-native invasive species that have the highest capacity to transform 
defaultnative 
defaulthabitats and ecosystems. 
default In some cases the Board needs to stimulate research where there are significant knowledge gaps. The two examples below illustrate the need to act now on (1) a high risk species not yet established in the 
defaultUK
default; and (2) on one which is established but spreading and whose ecological impact is not well understood.
default&#xa0;
default(1) Water hyacinth, native to 
defaultSouth America
default, is a major pest of water bodies, making them 
defaultunnavigable
default and reducing their biodiversity. This species does not breed in the 
defaultUK
default yet, but could do so in a series of warmer weather years. We need a formal watching brief backed by a rapid response mechanism to ensure that water hyacinth does not become established in the 
defaultUK
default&#xa0;
default(2) Chinese water deer, 
defaultestablished in the east of 
defaultEngland
default, has recently invaded 
defaultOrford
default Ness
default, a 15 km long shingle spit off the 
defaultSuffolk
default coast that is 
defaultinternationally important fo
defaultr its wildlife and 
defaulthistorical heritag
defaulte. 
defaultWe do not 
defaultknow 
defaultthe impact of Chinese water deer on either the natural or cultural or historical features on 
defaultOrford
default Ness
default but remain concerned about this knowledge gap.
default&#xa0;
default3.2 
defaultObjective setting and realistic 
defaultcostings
default for control/eradication of INNS
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the management of INNS 
defaultsuccess
default is reported in a variety of ways
default. It is 
defaultin
defaultsufficient for success to be gauged by how much 
defaultof a INNS
default has been removed. 
defaultA better measure 
defaultis if native species and habi
defaulttats can be shown to have 
defaultbeen restored
default, or ecosystem functioning improved
default as a result of the 
defaultmanagement
default. 
defaultWe should not be afraid to recognise failure but need to 
defaultmake sure effective communication is in place to report 
defaulton 
defaultwhat does not work.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.3 
defaultIncreasing 
defaultthe 
defaultuse of innovative 
defaultmethods 
defaultto 
defaultdetect
default early stages of
default 
defaultestablishment of INNS. 
default&#xa0;
defaultGovernment and others should make more use of innovative methods to detect the early stage of INNS establishment where these are practicable 
defaultFor example, hair tubes for mammals 
defaultand collections of faeces 
defaultfrom which DNA can be extracted to identify species and also individuals; e (environmental) DNA – which can be used to track presence of non-native invasive amphibians such as bullfrogs in ponds for example; camera
default traps. Much of the data collection can be done by volunteers but would need coordinating with state agencies and analysing by scientists.
default&#xa0;
default3.4 T
defaulthe minimum requirements for successful management 
defaultof INNS
default&#xa0;
defaultThe National Trust
default sees the minimum requirements for successful management of INNS as:
default&#xa0;
default3.4.1 
defaultRealistic and appropriate prioritisation based on risk assessment for native wildlife, people and the economy
default. This could lead to risk-
defaultbased trading of species such as 
defaultINNS of 
defaultaquatic plants
default3.4.2 Consultation with local people leading to r
defaultapid decision making leading to rapid action
default3.4.3 
defaultAction at the appropriate scale (e.g. 
defaultfor 
defaultbankside
default INNS plants such as Japanese knotweed,  whole water 
defaultcatchments rather than
default just one 
defaultpart of the 
defaultcatchment where the species is known and conspicuous
default)
default3.4.4 
defaultCriteria for success agreed early in the project
default, and success/failure reported on at milestones and at the end of the project.
default&#xa0;
default3.5 
defaultDelivery mechanisms
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe see a m
defaultajor role for Local Nature Partnerships 
defaultas delivery bodies 
defaultto coordinate, communicate and stimulate state agency, local authority and 
defaultvolunteer partnerships to tackle INNS
default. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.6 Legislation
default&#xa0;
defaultWe advocate b
defaultetter use of
default powers in
default 
defaultthe 
defaultW
defaultildlife 
default&amp; C
defaultountryside
default Act 1981 Schedu
defaultle 9 and equivalent in 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default to raise awareness of the risks of unrestricted movement of certain species by human agency, and also learning from INNS legislation in 
defaultScotland
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.7 Knowledge gaps
default&#xa0;
defaultWe advocate m
defaultore research on ecological processes and pathogens transfer
default between INNS and native species 
default(
defaultnon-native and native crayfish species;  grey/red squirrel - 
defaultNT supporting the latter)
default&#xa0;
default3.8 defaultThe Committee might want to consider the followingdefault&#xa0;
default3.8.
default1. Is the EU draft Directive on Invasive Non – Native Species (INNS) fit for purpose? 
default&#xa0;
defaultIs 
defaultthe EU draft Directive’s s
defaultelection of 50 species deemed to cause most
default harm
default sufficiently sensitive –
default or
default would a risk-based
default 
defaultselection
default, using 
defaultclimate change scenario
defaults and/or 
defaulthorizon scanning be better at preventing spread
default and 
defaultestablishment?
default&#xa0;
defaultWill the EU Directive be sufficiently sensitive to th
defaulte need to p
defaultrevent 
defaultthe
default spread of potentially invasive species from EU Member states where 
defaultthey are either 
defaultnative
default or 
defaultlong established to those where not yet established but where they could cause harm.
default&#xa0;
default3.8.2. 
default How do we prioritise (we cannot manage all INNS everywhere)? 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe should focus on s
defaulttrengthen
defaulting
default existing legislation
default. The
default Scottish model looks promising.
default E
defaultcological priorities
default should be based
default on global responsibilities
default, for example the
default removal of rats from seabird islands. Societal and economic benefits from managing INNS may
default however need to
default be based on different priorities
default, for instance 
defaultkeeping new plant diseases out of publicly accessible heritage gardens, and clearing away Himalayan balsam to allow access to river banks by anglers.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.8.
default3. How do we measure and report on success and failure? What does success look like?
default&#xa0;
defaultManagement needs to be lead by carefully constructed 
default‘
defaultsmart
default’
default objectives. INNS 
defaultcan be regarded as successfully managed
default when they have been prevented from invading the 
defaultUK
default through effective legislation and/or quarantine. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn some cases 
defaultinvading or established INNS may 
defaulthave been controlled successfully 
defaultbut the expected positive impacts such as evident restoration of native species and/or habitats
default or wider 
defaultsocietal or economic benefit may not have been measured. 
defaultThe f
defaultailure of management of INNS is rarely reported
default. This may be
default because objectives were poorly defined at the outset.
default&#xa0;
defaultA s
defaulttrengthened GB INNS Framework Strategy 
defaultcould help to address this problem
default, especially if
default it is
default more inclusive of NGOs in decision making
default and
default includ
defaultes
default on appropriate application of the precautionary principle.
default&#xa0;
default3.8.
default4. Should there be a
default UK/all 
defaultIreland
default approach to management of INNS?
default&#xa0;
defaultINNSs do not respect international boundaries, especially when there is no sea barrier or obvious border control. It makes sense to support the strengthening of al 
defaultUK
default/ all 
defaultIreland
default strategy to tackle INNS. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAgain a strengthened GB INNS Framework Strat
defaultegy has a supporting role here, as it does in promoting functional working links between Departments at state borders.
