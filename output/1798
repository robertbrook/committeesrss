[normal]2[bold].[bold] [bold]How do Government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities (including [bold]rural and urban areas and island communities)?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal].1. 
[normal]As context, a complete network redesign and recast of 
[normal]services
[normal] w
[normal]ould carry a high risk of 
[normal]losing many more current passengers than 
[normal]those it may
[normal] gain. Given that p
[normal]eople often make decisions on where they 
[normal]live and where they work based on current provision, there is a need to produce a degree of stability in the provision of the public transport network
[normal] if we wish to avoid taking away the 
[normal]means
[normal] of getting to work for these people. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal].2. 
[normal]I
[normal]dentify
[normal]ing
[normal] unmet d
[normal]emand
[normal] in a way that can result in significant passenger flows is not easy
[normal], and 
[normal]a service designed for this 
[normal]will often take a long period of 
[normal]operation
[normal] to translate into significant passenger flows. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal].3. 
[normal]In addition to 
[normal]identifying how current services meet
[normal] demand
[normal], 
[normal]unlike for 
[normal]n
[normal]ew 
[normal]housing or business development areas, new demands in 
[normal]rural 
[normal]or isolated 
[normal]areas tend to be more limited and of relatively small flows. The common means of identifying demand are through:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3[bold]. [bold]To what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers [bold](e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal].1. 
[normal]For p
[normal]eople with disabilities
[normal], the 
[normal]increasing
[normal] 
[normal]proportion
[normal] of 
[normal]services
[normal] operated by low floor 
[normal]accessi
[normal]ble
[normal] buses is 
[normal]improving
[normal] 
[normal]accessibility
[normal] for many. 
[normal]Dial a Ride/ Ring &amp; Ride  services for the “frail elderly and disabled” 
[normal]can 
[normal]provide
[normal] for those 
[normal]who cannot physically access conventional bus services either due to boarding difficulties or due to distance from the bus stop. 
[normal]Other 
[normal]services
[normal] can also be 
[normal]provided
[normal], e.g. to provide 
[normal]bespoke
[normal] 
[normal]transport
[normal] to 
[normal]health
[normal] 
[normal]services
[normal]/
[normal]hospitals
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal].2. 
[normal]The degree to which 
[normal]Demand Responsive Transport (
[normal]DRT
[normal])
[normal] services are actually able to cater for access to work, as opposed to access to town centre and other essential services, needs to be questioned.
[normal] T
[normal]hey are not always well-suited to catering for regular journeys to/ from wo
[normal]rk by workers, 
[normal]given 
[normal]constraints
[normal] 
[normal]that
[normal] 
[normal]long term 
[normal]pre-booking ahead cannot be 
[normal]guaranteed
[normal] where 
[normal]routeing 
[normal]has to 
[normal]compromise
[normal] to 
[normal]take account of all users across an area. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal].3. 
[normal]Engagement
[normal] with young people 
[normal]suggest
[normal]s
[normal] that they 
[normal]tend
[normal] not to favour 
[normal]pre-booked DRT services 
[normal]as 
[normal]they
[normal] feel 
[normal]better served by regular timetabled services 
[normal]given the 
[normal]“turn-up-and-go”
[normal] nature of much of
[normal] their travel patterns.
[normal] Fare levels can also be a barrier for young people’s travel.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4[bold]. [bold]What are the main challenges associated [bold]with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].1. 
[normal]It is difficult to generalise on specific solutions g
[normal]iven geographical differences across the country in 
[normal]both urban and 
[normal]rural areas
[normal] where isolation is an issue
[normal]:
[normal] terrain, road pattern
[normal]/ density
[normal], the various ways different towns can act as a draw for people to visit and work, etc.
[normal] Barriers to travel can occur in urban as well as rural areas.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].2. 
[normal]A one size-fits all approach 
[normal]in relation to service type is unlikely to be beneficially applied to all rural 
[normal]or urban 
[normal]areas. 
[normal]Different 
[normal]service
[normal] types, and 
[normal]different
[normal] mixes at times of DRT and 
[normal]timetable
[normal]d
[normal] 
[normal]services
[normal], will suit different areas.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].3. 
[normal]Rural 
[normal]passenger 
[normal]flows are 
[normal]frequently 
[normal]diverse and often cannot easily be aggregated together into cost-efficient routes.
[normal] 
[normal]Where there are different needs - in different directions, at different times, or at interchanges onto or from a train service – 
[normal]it is has 
[normal]to 
[normal]be a pre-requisite of public tr
[normal]ansport planning that priority 
[normal]tends to focus on
[normal] “the greatest benefit for the greatest number” 
[normal]or o
[normal]n
[normal] needs that can be met cost-
[normal]effectiv
[normal]e
[normal]ly
[normal]. 
[normal]Inevitably
[normal] therefore 
[normal]other needs 
[normal]may
[normal] not be met
[normal] - 
[normal]and r
[normal]ural transport cannot 
[normal]always 
[normal]be all things to all people
[normal] 
[normal]in an 
[normal]area
[normal];
[normal] many people 
[normal]may
[normal] feel that it serves their needs badly if at all, even if the predominant needs are catered for.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].
[normal]4
[normal]. 
[normal]R
[normal]ural employment is 
[normal]often 
[normal]characterised by 
[normal]many 
[normal]s
[normal]mall &amp; 
[normal]m
[normal]edium 
[normal]e
[normal]nterprises (
[normal]SMEs) in 
[normal]widely scattered 
[normal]locations. 
[normal]Significant and established flows 
[normal]to work 
[normal]are therefore often difficult to 
[normal]provide for
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5[bold]. [bold]How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal].1. 
[normal]Community transport 
[normal](CT) 
[normal]often primarily
[normal] focus
[normal]ses
[normal] on the needs of the frail elderly and disabled
[normal], and less well on the needs of 
[normal]people who need transport to get to work, or the travel needs of young people
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal].2. 
[normal]The sector is very diverse, from some larg
[normal]er community transport groups that act virtually as commercial operators in tendering for large contracts, through to many small groups, often with just one or two vehicles, for whom the Community Interest Company model 
[normal]may be
[normal] seen to be
[normal] both less beneficial and less relevant. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal].3. 
[normal]The difficulties 
[normal]in serving 
[normal]isolated areas are the same for community transport as for commercial operators and councils: serv
[normal]ices 
[normal]will always 
[normal]tend to 
[normal]require significant subsidy to meet the shortfall between
[normal] operating costs and fares revenue from relatively small numbers of passengers travelling. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal].4. 
[normal]Community
[normal] 
[normal]transport
[normal] best serves i
[normal]t
[normal]s own community: m
[normal]any rural council funded bus routes 
[normal]are 
[normal]unsuitable
[normal] for CT operation as they serve 
[normal]a number of 
[normal]communities
[normal] across rel
[normal]a
[normal]t
[normal]i
[normal]v
[normal]e
[normal]ly 
[normal]long di
[normal]s
[normal]ta
[normal]n
[normal]ces
[normal]. 
[normal]Other b
[normal]arriers to CT operation of these services
[normal] 
[normal]may include
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal].5. 
[normal]The view
[normal],
[normal] that community tra
[normal]n
[normal]sport will simply back-fill 
[normal]bus 
[normal]servi
[normal]c
[normal]es cut by councils
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]is unlikely to become a reality. 
[normal]Most services for isolated rural areas that are council funded are likely to continue to require revenue support; that is why they are supported and not commercial in the first place. 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]injection
[normal] of kickstart 
[normal]funding
[normal] is unlikely to provide lasting long-t
[normal]erm 
[normal]improved 
[normal]viability
[normal] and is 
[normal]felt to be 
[normal]generally 
[normal]of limited value, 
[normal]in 
[normal]certain circumstances only, such as 
[normal]for 
[normal]services that are relatively close to financial sustainab
[normal]i
[normal]l
[normal]ity
[normal] and just need a push to achieve viability.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal].6. 
[normal]T
[normal]here are clearly exceptions 
[normal]where 
[normal]geography etc. may help
[normal] enable a more viable operation
[normal], but on the whole there is little scope for making services 
[normal]serving 
[normal]isolated
[normal] 
[normal]communities
[normal], or even many rural
[normal] 
[normal]areas 
[normal]generally
[normal], 
[normal]sustainable. 
[normal]We need therefore to 
[normal]understand
[normal] that it is 
[normal]unrealistic
[normal] t
[normal]o suppose that:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](i) if only 
[normal]council
[normal] 
[normal]supported
[normal] 
[normal]services
[normal] were managed or operated in a different way they 
[normal]would
[normal] not need support;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](ii) council funded bus services will be routinely operated by the 
[normal]community
[normal] 
[normal]transport
[normal] 
[normal]sector
[normal] if the council 
[normal]funding
[normal] ends. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6[bold]. [bold]To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]6
[normal].1. 
[normal]Taxis are 
[normal]seen as 
[normal]universally available, but the cost is clearly prohibitive for regular use for many people
[normal], and
[normal] w
[normal]heelchair accessible taxis are not universally available in rural areas. 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]Joseph Rowntree Foundation (2010) identified that Transport Poverty is a greater factor in rural areas than Fuel Poverty
[normal], but we still hear more about the latter
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6
[normal].2. 
[normal]D
[normal]RT s
[normal]er
[normal]vices are often unsuitable for regular commuting to work. Often schemes only allow for booking up to a week/ fortnight ahead, which in itself is a barrier to meeting workers’ travel needs.
[normal] 
[normal]DRT can be seen to 
[normal]provide
[normal] better
[normal] for off-peak accessibility needs 
[normal]to shopping/ town centre facilities and services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6
[normal].3. 
[normal]DRT often has higher costs per passenger than conventional bus services. A number of DRT services promoted as a cost-effective way to provide access in rural areas have in recent years been 
[normal]terminated
[normal] due to high costs.
[normal] 
[normal]It cannot therefore be 
[normal]assumed
[normal] that there is a continuum of reducing service levels in line with 
[normal]reducing
[normal] cost 
[normal](
[normal]per 
[normal]passenger
[normal]),
[normal] 
[normal]from 
[normal]high frequency buses to low frequency buses to DRT: when replacing low frequency buses with DRT costs
[normal] p
[normal]er passenger
[normal] are 
[normal]frequently
[normal] found to rise. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6
[normal].4. 
[normal]The cost of o
[normal]ff
[normal]-
[normal]peak rural services i
[normal]s often lower by using
[normal] resources more fully, i.e. using buses
[normal] -
[normal] on the margin
[normal] - 
[normal]that are fully used in the peak for commuting etc., 
[normal]as opposed to 
[normal]less efficient use of resources such as 
[normal]th
[normal]e
[normal]se buses being parked 
[normal]up 
[normal]in the off-peak and using other smaller vehicles for off-peak DRT services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7[bold]. [bold]What are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can [bold]these services be made more affordable?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]7
[normal].1. 
[normal]Many public transport services serving isolated communities can never become sustainable, given the low revenue compared to costs
[normal];
[normal] the aspiration to make these services affordable 
[normal]in terms of financial viability 
[normal]may be largely unobtainable. The degree to which the level of financial support needed can be seen to be acceptable is determined by a number of factors. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7
[normal].2. 
[normal]ENCTS
[normal]The continued high cost of the ENCTS public transport spe
[normal]nd acts as a barrier to continuing spend on supporting rural public transport services
[normal]. 
[normal]Given the pressure on budgets
[normal],
[normal] many councils 
[normal]may 
[normal]understandably feel they are already spending too much on public transport
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7
[normal].3. 
[normal]Cross-sector 
[normal]Benefits
[normal] and Challenges
[normal]For most councils their funding of bus services is probably the greatest single positive impact (compared to any other initiative) on each of
[normal] the following key policy aims
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7
[normal].4. 
[normal]Whilst t
[normal]his is felt to be often generally unrecognised across councils and central government
[normal], If the
[normal]se
[normal] cross sector benefits could be levered into funding services, these services are likely in many cases to become affordable.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.5. 
[normal]The cross-sector benefits of bus services are significant. This has been 
[normal]recently evidenced
[normal] in many national reports from a
[normal] wide range of bodies (Appendix 1) and yet continues to be largely unrecognised
[normal] in government policies
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7
[normal].
[normal]6
[normal]. 
[normal]A significant element of th
[normal]is 
[normal]value of bus services lies in other organisations
[normal], 
[normal]e.g.:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.
[normal]7
[normal]. 
[normal]However with services under pressure and the need for short term cost reductions, there 
[normal]appears to be
[normal] little incentive to consider longer term benefits from working 
[normal]across organisations. It also requires 
[normal]these other 
[normal]agencies to decide to spend money other than within their areas of professional expertise
[normal],
[normal] by diverting funding to transport. 
[normal]In
[normal] 
[normal]th
[normal]e
[normal] absence of central polic
[normal]i
[normal]es
[normal] on these lines
[normal], c
[normal]ouncils have a pivotal, but culturally 
[normal]very 
[normal]difficult, role to play in facilitating this if the best long-term decisions are to be made.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7
[normal].
[normal]8
[normal]. 
[normal]It is 
[normal]felt to be 
[normal]not c
[normal]onstructive 
[normal]for government to leave these decisions to local government when 
[normal]council
[normal] financ
[normal]es are being 
[normal]reduced
[normal] to such an extent that non-statutory services, no matter how worthy or recognised those services may be within a council, 
[normal]provide the main scope for 
[normal]cut
[normal]s
[normal] to meet the budget reductions
[normal] s
[normal]et by central government
[normal] under the Spending Review
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7
[normal].
[normal]9
[normal]. 
[normal]Competing with other Services for Shrinking Budgets
[normal]The high
[normal] 
[normal]cost
[normal] per
[normal] passenger 
[normal]of 
[normal]services
[normal] 
[normal]in 
[normal]isolated
[normal] or rural 
[normal]communities
[normal] 
[normal]compared
[normal] to 
[normal]lower cost/ passenger urban and inter-urban services
[normal] is bound to disadvantage 
[normal]these
[normal] 
[normal]services
[normal] when competing for 
[normal]funding
[normal] in 
[normal]reducing
[normal] budgets. 
[normal]Cost
[normal] per
[normal] passenger is a prime assessment tool, as 
[normal]a 
[normal]means of minimising the number of people affected by service reductions. 
[normal]The fact that rural services in the main are unlikely to ever become financially s
[normal]ustainable can lead to these services
[normal] being seen
[normal] as both inefficient and as a funding “bottomless pit”.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7
[normal].1
[normal]0
[normal]. 
[normal]Rural public transport is 
[normal]further at risk
[normal], given
[normal] shrinking budgets
[normal],
[normal] through what is often seen as a lack of understanding of passenger needs
[normal] 
[normal]or 
[normal]assum
[normal]ptions that 
[normal]“they will 
[normal]find other ways to get to work”
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]d
[normal]ecision-makers tend to be car drivers
[normal]. More 
[normal]research
[normal] is needed on the reliance of those who need the bus to get to work
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]whether they could get to work 
[normal]if the bus service stopped.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7

[normal]Affordability 
[normal]has to

[normal]ly
[normal] reassessing how 
[normal]public 
[normal]transport should be funded, and aligning the funding stream 
[normal]with

[normal]policy 
[normal]areas and agencies where transport provides benefits, will the real financial and societal
[normal] net overall benefits
[normal],
[normal] that transport networks provide
[normal],
[normal] be safeguard into the future. 
[normal]Unless 
[normal]government departments are sufficiently joined-up
[normal],
[normal] on funding transport through the benefits it provides those department
[normal]s
[normal], it is unlikely that the locally based p
[normal]ublic sector, who take their cue and targets from central government, will generally work together with councils on this.

[normal]on this that 
[normal]needs to be

[normal]. 
[normal]The 
[normal]imbalances 
[normal]need to be resolved
[normal] between (a) the risk to council public transport funded services, and (b) the growing evidence of the undoubted benefits of public transport to the economy and national policy aims
[normal]. Without government action on this 
[normal]as a matter of urgen
[normal]cy

[normal]with t

[normal] -
[normal] the count
[normal]r
[normal]y’s rural 
[normal]and isolated 
[normal]areas face the likely prospect of large scale withdrawal of any or all public transport except those that do not requir
[normal]es financial support.
