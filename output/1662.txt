[[[Executive Summary]]]1.1 CPL welcomes the Select Committee’s inquiry into Heat. Our response focuses on biomass systems and the supply of sustainable UK biomass fuel which is CPL’s core area of expertise and as such we have responded to the questions that are relevant to our business and expertise. In order to expand on the points raised, CPL would be delighted to provide further written or oral evidence if this is required.&#xa0;1.2 We have some concerns that the issue of biomass sustainability has been over simplified by campaigners and the media in recent months. Biomass has several uses; generating heat, providing power in the form of electricity generation and as a fuel for transport. In discussing sustainability concerns there is a tendency to refer to all of these uses collectively without looking at the relative merits of each type of use. &#xa0;1.3 Biomass burned to produce heat is 85% efficient compared to generating electricity by burning pure biomass which is only 30-35% efficient1. The level of support provided to generate electricity from biomass is out of proportion compared to the level of support for heat when the scale of inefficiency is taken into consideration. For example, suppliers receive 1.5ROCs/MWH for biomass electricity; ROCs currently trade on average at £43, this equates to £65/MWH plus the price for the electricity. However, a 1MW biomass boiler under the commercial RHI currently receives 1p/kWh which equates to just £10/MWH.  1.4 Secondly, the use of biomass to generate heat is the most deployed technology under the non-domestic RHI scheme. This, along with widespread uptake in other European markets demonstrates that biomass is currently one of the most desirable renewable and low carbon technologies for consumers. The degression of the medium biomass tariff (commercial systems between 200kW and 1MW heating capacity) under the budget management mechanism for the RHI is a serious issue. Whilst having a range of renewable technologies is desirable, attempting to create an equal market without reviewing current market desirability of technologies is not in line with meeting renewables targets. CPL was relieved that in the latest RHI quarterly forecast statement to 31 July 2013, no further degression will take place this autumn. However, medium biomass did exceed its trigger and the overall trigger was close to being met. Medium biomass only avoided further degression because this overall spend was a mere £800,000 below the trigger point of £60.1 million – despite the fact that DECC are way below required deployment levels to achieve renewable heat ambitions. CPL remains concerns by how narrowly these triggers were missed; medium biomass is on the brink of another degression that could flatten the market and damage the chances of meeting renewables targets.  1.5 We have some concern over the pace of decarbonisation of heating and call upon the Committee to play particular attention to DECC’s work in the following areas:&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The tariff bands for the non-domestic RHI which are causing widespread market distortion. CPL is seeing clustering of systems at tariff boundaries (e.g. at 975/995kWh) and evidence of under specification in order to gain from the medium tariff band. This band being preferred due to the inadequate rate of return for larger installations. To resolve this issue, a more intelligent tariff system is required – perhaps with a greater number of tariff bands.b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The budget management mechanism and the early degression of the medium biomass tariff which jeopardises achievement of renewable heat ambitions. Whilst a budget management tool is necessary DECC should be enabled to apply discretion in scenarios such as this, where the market for the most deployed technology is now facing restrictions.c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A simple change to the RHI budget mechanism that would significantly reduce the prospect of premature tariff degression would be to merge some of the set-aside budgets for individual tariff bands. Instead of separate budgets for small, medium and large biomass, DECC should instead have one simple consolidated budget.d)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The support for biomass used for heat should recognise incentives available for less efficient uses elsewhere and seek to encourage most efficient use of resources.e)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Sustainability standards for biomass for heating are in place under the RHI and should continue to be set at least as high as those set out for biomass at a European level. Standards should be reviewed on a regular basis.

[[[ Is the government taking the right approach to reduce heat energy demand?]]]3.2 A number of policy measures have been introduced to incentivise energy efficiency improvements to reduce the demand for heat. These include the Green Deal and ECO with minimum energy performance an entry requirement for the domestic RHI.3.3 It should be noted that there is a limit to which heat demand can be reduced through energy efficiency in much of the UK’s building stock. Many older properties would require substantial and un-economic (even with Green Deal Finance) improvements to make a meaningful reduction in heat demand. In other circumstances, such as with listed buildings and in natural conservation areas, many demand reducing measures will be unsuitable.3.4 It therefore makes sense to target low carbon and renewable heating solutions at those buildings which are using the most harmful fuels (off the gas grid) and for which it will be hardest to reduce demand. The associated ‘’bang for buck’’ in applying a renewable system in such circumstances will be much higher compared to a building where demand can be substantially reduced through efficiency and where the primary heating fuel is gas.3.5&#xa0; What progress is the government making on reducing the demand for heat?3.6 The latest Heat Strategy document published in April 20132 sets out the government’s plans to meet the heat challenge in industrial heat, networked heat, heat in buildings, grids and infrastructure. 3.7

[[[CPL welcomes many of the proposals in the Heat Strategy]]] including evidence of actions to support the launch of the domestic Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI). After a long wait for the domestic RHI scheme to be finalised (which came after the Heat Strategy was published), actions to demonstrate the government’s commitment are important. 3.8 The evidence annex to the Heat Strategy provides two cost-optimisation scenarios models (RESOM and ESME). CPL is concerned that

[[[ model shows particularly high deployment of biomass heating in 2050]]]. This also appears contradictory to efforts to promote biomass through the RHI.3.9 The basis of a limited role for biomass in DECC’s longer term scenarios is unclear and may be due to limitations in scenario models. However, if the DECC models assume a steady-state (i.e. no future improvements) for biomass heating technology we would argue that this is unlikely to be the case.3.10

[[[Biomass heating is one of the most efficient methods of producing renewable energy. There are substantial opportunities to improve the way biomass ]]]

[[[is utilised in heating within the UK]]], through more efficient heating systems, cost reduction in manufacture and installation, alternative feedstocks and process innovations such as torrefaction. 3.11 Torrefaction is the thermochemical treatment of biomass at 200 to 320C, carried out under atmospheric pressure and in the absence of oxygen. Torrefied pellets can be produced from a wide range of biomass feedstocks and the process removes water and other substances leaving a solid material which can be densified into briquettes or pellets. The main advantage of this process is that each torrefied pellet could contain twice the energy as those pellets available today; this reduces transportation and storage costs. The implementation of the RHI presents a medium term commercial opportunity for existing technologies and users. However, the Heat Strategy illustrates that 

[[[more support for the biomass industry is required to ensure it can fulfil its important role ]]]

[[[in developing new innovative technologies]]]

[[[.]]]3.12 To provide more adequate support, improvements must be made to tariff levels under the RHI. It should be noted that evidence from banks and other internal investors shows that the threshold for lending to new projects in most circumstances is a Return on Capital Expenditure (RoCE) of 15% or higher. The DECC methodology uses a Rate of Return (RoR) set at just 12% which is less well recognised in the marketplace. In addition, a review of the budget management mechanism should be carried out to remove any overzealous or premature degression of tariff rates.  3.13

[[[Under the non-domestic RHI the current biomass tariffs do not provide adequate support for the technology to be deployed correctly]]]. Clustering of installations around the tariff boundaries is evidence that installations are being underspecified (e.g. at 975/995kWh) to fall into the medium biomass tariff. CPL has seen instances where these underspecified systems must continue to rely on an existing fossil fuel boiler system. Had the &gt;1MW tariff provided an adequate rate of return then a correctly sized installation would have enabled the fossil fuel system to be completely removed. 3.14 Furthermore, 

[[[the design of the budget management mechanism resulted in degression of the medium scale biomass tariff when th]]]

[[[is is the only technology currently performing strongly.]]] CPL is concerned that further degression will result in medium biomass installations, particularly at the lower end of the tariff boundaries, becoming completely unviable. CPL fears that this would flatten the market and severely damage progress towards meeting the UK renewables targets. A simple change to the RHI budget mechanism that would significantly reduce the prospect of premature tariff degression would be to merge some of the set-aside budgets for individual tariff bands. Instead of separate budgets for small, medium and large biomass, DECC should instead have one simple consolidated budget.3.15 Biomass is deemed a key fuel for heat production from both the cost and GHG perspectives. What should be done to ensure methods of calculating biomass GHG balance represent an accurate picture?3.16 DECC provides sustainability requirements for biomass including GHG requirements and in addition there are specific sustainability requirements being implemented under the RHI. An online tool - the UK Biomass &amp; Biogas Carbon Calculator is provided by OFGEM to enable generators and others to assess the emissions associated with biomass electricity and heat generation. The tool takes into account the emissions across the bio-energy lifecycle from cultivation of biomass to processing and transport. The calculator should be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure the process takes into account the most up-to-date information available on the bio-energy lifecycle.3.17 Additional actions that generators and suppliers of biomass can take to ensure accountability of standards, including GHG, through the supply chain include:CPL has a robust understand of sustainability issues and fully complies with each of these additional actions.3.18 There are sustainability guidelines for biomass, do these go far enough?3.19 Under the RHI, sustainability regulations for biomass are to be laid by the end of 2013 and compliance demonstrated by April 2014. RHI recipients must provide evidence of performance; including 60% GHG savings against EU fossil fuel heat average, and meet specific land use criteria. Alternatively, RHI recipients are permitted to source fuel from ‘approved supplier’ lists.3.20

[[[CPL supports the introduction of biomass sustainability regulations but is concerned about confusion between the use of biomass to g]]]

[[[enerate electricity, transport fuel and heat. ]]]Biomass for heating and combined heat power is the most effective use of biomass. Generally speaking, using bioenergy for heat and power is more efficient in reducing GHG compared to using bioenergy for transport fuel. Indeed, burning pure biomass to produce heat is 85% efficient; generating electricity by burning the same material is only approximately 30-35% efficient1. 3.21 The below chart (adapted from ‘The Carbon Balance of Woodfuel’, Northern Woodheat, 2010) compares the estimated ‘carbon balance’ of a range of different woodfuels and compares them with the carbon balance of fossil fuels conventionally used for heating. The CO2 emissions associated with the use of wood as a fuel were calculated considering every step in the process including planting, harvesting, transportation of timber, processing, transportation of processed fuel and finally the use of the wood as fuel. Woodfuels produce a relatively low amount of CO2 even where they are imported.&#xa0;3.22 Sustainability standards for biomass in the UK should reflect the desire to encourage use in its most efficient application i.e. heat.  This may mean that higher sustainability standards are required for less efficient uses such as power generation; such as the 70% GHG savings compared to fossil fuel alternatives recently announced to ensure the sustainability of wood-fuel used to create energy.

[[[whilst not deterring investment]]]. As the biomass market expands there will be increased competition to provide cheaper sources of biofuels, whether from within the EU or the rest of the world. Robust regulations should prevent the use of non-sustainable sources whilst promoting a fair price for approved sources.3.24 What will the local environmental impact (for example air pollution) be from the use heat generation in urban areas, for example CHP units?3.25 Local environmental pollution is potentially a big issue for the low carbon heating sector. The current application of air quality rules in planning means that companies deploying these technologies must navigate a patchwork of different standards and requirements across the country. It makes sense to have rules on air quality; however efforts to promote a national approach would be beneficial.3.26 As an example, biomass boilers installed under the RHI will soon be subject to emissions constraints for NOx and Particulates. However, biomass boilers not installed under the RHI will not be subject to the same constraints. It is logical to develop consistent requirements as part of the Clean Air Act and Air Quality Regulations. A review of the Clean Air Act is underway this year. CPL strongly supports the maintenance and development of the Clean Air Act.3.27 Consideration should also be given to the type of heating system that is being replaced with a renewable source. Where a replacement technology is ‘no worse’ in terms of air pollution than the existing system but provides considerable improvements in relation to CO2 emissions, this should be taken in consideration. This in order to avoid a scenario where older inefficient systems are not being replaced because the air quality standards are too high. Ideally, CPL would advise following the same route as the Republic of Ireland and becoming entirely smokeless as the best way to tackle the issue of air pollution. Restrictions on the burning of specified solid fuels would be more effective than placing restrictions on more efficient heating systems, especially where the air pollution is no worse.3.28 In addition, if it is designed and implemented correctly, the European EcoDesign Directive has the potential to solve many of the emissions problems in the domestic sector by providing a framework of requirements to reduce emissions.3.29 What are the relative merits of using gas to directly provide space heating compared to centralised electricity production plus domestic heat pumps? 3.30 On site biomass boilers have more merits than gas and produce fewer emissions compared to centralised electricity production. A domestic heat pump powered by centralised electricity production has two inefficiencies when compared to the use of an on-site biomass boiler (as opposed to gas). First, a heat pump must rely on a back-up boiler, likely to be fossil fuel, during colder periods. Second, as outlined above, the burning of biomass to generate electricity is significantly less efficient than to produce heat. 3.31 What are the lock-in, costs and GHG savings from the promotion of different forms of domestic heating solution? 3.32 Every year, 1.5 million gas boilers and 65,000 oil boilers are installed in the UK. Each of these installations represents a lock-in of at least ten years. Compared to such fossil fuel systems, the benefits of a biomass system include:Lower emissions/more efficientPrice Consumer appealAvailability&#xa0;3.33 How successful will the RHI be when rolled out to households?3.34

[[[ We expect]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.37 Whilst it must be noted that commercial and domestic decisions will differ when installing new technologies, biomass has an advantage in that it uses boiler technology which is familiar to domestic customers. In a study into consumer behaviour included in the evidence annex to the Heat Strategy2, 47% of homeowners had heard of a biomass boiler compared to 47% for GSHP, 32% for ASHP, 31% for heat networks and 27% for micro-CHP.
