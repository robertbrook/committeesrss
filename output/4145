defaultWritten evidence submitted by Peter Weitzel [FBB0058]defaultIntroductiondefault defaultThi
defaults response is by Peter Weitzel, I am a
default chartered electrical engineer with over 40 years of working in 
defaultthe
default media industry for the BBC and others and with an involvement in Professional Societies in Film and TV engineering, Electronic Engineering &amp; Technology
default, Audio 
defaultand the Television industry at large. 
defaultI wish to particularly comment on the Role if the BBC as 
defaulta Public Service Broadcaster in the service that it provides to the UK public and creative industries in the field of Technological advancement, Engineering Standards and 
defaultE
defaultducation of the 
defaultt
defaultechnical creative workforce. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat should the BBC be for and what 
defaultshould be the purpose of public service broadcasting?
defaultThe 
defaultBBC has enriched the life of the UK and the world by its cultural output and in the technological 
defaultarea has
default provided and should 
defaultcontinue to
default provide leadership 
defaultto broad ranges
default of Industries across the
default world. 
defaultA civilised country requires 
defaultsome
default strong
default 
defaultorganisation
default which can embody all of its Culture no matter how diverse and be a 
defaultforce
default for 
defaulteducation
default and bringing the country together.  
defaultThe easiest way of doing is by 
defaultBroadcasting where
default it is beneficial to 
defaulthave some 
defaultorganisations whose
default purpose is to promote culture, 
defaulteducation,
default 
defaultimpartial
default news for the good of the public at large 
default– the PSBs. 
defaultThe BBC has been for historic reasons the leader in Public Service Broadcasting – and, unlike some PSBs, 
defaulthas 
defaultbeen inspir
defaulted 
default by, 
defaultand able to move with
default,
default the technologies th
defaultus 
defaultensuring that all can access its output in means that the 
defaultindividual listener
default,
default viewer or surfer 
defaultfinds convenient.  
defaultThis cannot be left to the market alone as we seen by how some PSB have seen their role
default and have not made their 
defaultcontent as available
default as the BBC (or anywhere near it!)  And there is a need for a Commercia
defaultl
defaultl
defaulty
default independent organisation like the BBC in  a world where the  UK Largest broadcaster/platform operator  by Turnover also being the  UKs s
defaultecond largest ISP, and the UK Largest ISP being now a notable provider of TV platforms and content.  
defaultThis can only get more complex and thus the is a need for a sufficiently  large and influential non-commercial publicly focused (and well-funded) Broadcas
defaultter within a PSB sector to serve those in our community who cannot afford the cost of Pay TV – and to provide a high quality Universally accessed free at  point of delivery Public service.
defaultIt should be noticed that despite these large players the BBC whils
defaultt being a significant player in terms of income is still the largest spender on UK creative content as it has no shareholder to pay. 
defaultThe BBC is one leading organisation which can represent all communities of the UK and be a significant and most influentia
defaultl part of the Media continuum which is so varied – But only work
defaults
default because of the unique scope of the BBC and the way that it has (up to now) have sufficient income in a certain 
defaultindependent 
defaultmanner to carry out its public purpose, and to enrich our lives. 
default&#xa0;
default How well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period in achieving its mission and public purposes?
defaultAre the public purposes in the current Charter the right ones? How might they change?
defaultI 
defaultbelieve
default that 
defaultthe BBC
default Has 
defaultfulfilled
default it public 
defaultpurposes
default very
default 
defaultwell
default and I 
defaultthink
default 
defaultthat
default they cover we
defaultll
default what is 
defaultexpected
default of a 
defaultPSB.
defaultAs an engineer I would like to point out two 
defaultof the Public 
defaultPurposes where
default I can bring my own experience of the BBC to bear. 
default default(defaultb) Promotingdefault education and learning; defaultI
default note the great work tha
defaultt the BBC 
defaultdoes 
defaultThrough the B
defaultB
defaultC 
defaultA
defaultcademy
default to promote learning and best p
defaultractise 
defaultin the creative and re
defaultlated 
defaulttechnological industries.  
default I 
defaultwelcome the
default 
defaultestablishment
default of the 
defaultnewly formed 
defaultCollege 
defaultof
default 
defaultTechnology to
default carry on 
defaultthe
default great 
defaulttradition
default of technical 
defaulttraining
default undertaken at BBC Wood Norton. 
default 
defaultAs well as the initiatives across 
defaultthe
default BBC to provide apprenticeships in many career paths 
defaultI particularly praise the 
defaultBBC 
defaultTe
defaultchnology Appr
defaultent
defaultices and Trainees
default in cooperation with other companies in the broadcasting field.
default 
defaultA
defaults a member of SMPTE - the 
defaultworldwide
default society for the technology of the moving image - I felt that it was typical of the BBC intent and need for collaboration that the College of Technology was launched in the 
defaultpresence of
default 
defaultthe 
defaultSMPTE 
defaultE
defaultxecutive Director and man
defaulty members at 
defaulta 
defaultSMPTE meeting in November
default 
defaultat 
defaultNew 
defaultBroadcasting
default House
default.
default I felt honoured that the BBC had chosen SMPTE to be the forum to announce its new initiative.
defaultThis activity
default of the 
defaultAcademy specified
default under Section 84 of the 
defaultAgreement supports
default the UK 
defaultindus
defaulttries in
default a way that no one else can and thus should be an activity which the BBC 
defaultcontinues to
default 
defaultp
defaultrovide.  
defaultI also would like to point out that there is a great shortage of younger people joining the engineering professions and thus 
defaultI value
default BBC output on Radio TV and the web which explains science, mathematics and technology to the audience particularly to teenagers.
default 
default I applaud the BBC intent to promote Coding and hope that this can be as successful in making young people interested in the 
defaultdigital world (which is our future) as the BBC micro was 35 years ago – which raised the awareness of the UK as to Technology being our 
defaultcountries 
defaultfuture.
default default(f)in promoting its other purposes, helping to deliver to the public the benefit defaultof emergingdefault communicdefaultations technologies and services and, in addition, taking adefault defaultleading role in the switchover to digital television.defaultI
default note the great success of the UK DSO and the contribution of the BBC and other bodies who have been instrumental 
default 
default in making DSO a great suc
defaultcess, and the continued work to develop through the air Television such as the widespread emission of HD services.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe BBC is the one of the few Broadcasters in the world who has the research and development as wel
defaultl
default as operational 
defaulte
defaultngineers and technolo
defaultgists covering a wide range of areas, and with a 
defaultg
defaultreat depth of 
defaultk
defaultnowledge. 
default 
defaultAnd
default 
defaultthe commitments 
defaultof the BBC in the setting of 
defaultopen standards 
defaultwhich make the 
defaulttechnology   
defaultprovide 
defaultan ease and universality of use by the audience.  
defaultI must record great 
defaultcontribution
default made by BBC R&amp;D whose 
defaultBrief
default is given by 
defaultSection
default 87 of the 
defaultagreement
default.  And also to 
defaultthe contribution made by the BBC 
defaultat 
defaultlarge in
default the drafting, setting, verifying and use 
defaultof 
defaultopen 
defaultstandards. F
defaultrom personal 
defaultexperience
default I can 
defaultacknowledge on
default the 
defaultexcell
defaultence
default and 
defaultcollaboration of the BBC staff 
defaulton th
defaultes
defaulte 
defaultactivities
default – within 
defaultindustry 
defaultgroups
default like 
defaultAMWA,
default 
defaultDPP, DTG, EBU, 
defaultITU
default and SMPTE. 
default 
default 
defaultAs the Technology gets more complex the contribution of the BBC in standards setting as a means of advancing the technologies of the media is greatly appreciated and should continue. 
defaultRelated to this is the education of the industry in these new technologi
defaultes and standards as carried out by the College of Technology within 
defaultthe 
defaultBBC Academy and the encouragement to BBC Staff to attend 
defaultand speak at 
defaultmeetings and
default conferences of a technical nature. 
defaultWhat scope, scale and remit should the BBC have? 
defaultShould the BBC
default’s output and services be provided to any greater or lesser degree for particular audiences? 
defaultWhat balance should be struck in what the BBC produces in-house, commissions externally and leaves entirely to others to create?
defaultAs I outlined earlier –I see the
default creative strength and efficiency of the BBC is that it cover all aspects of the media. Thus it would affects the dynamic of 
defaultthe
default whole of 
defaultthe
default successful UK Media industries which not only provides excellent  entertainment education and  information to the 
defaultUK (and world) public – but also sustains a very successful UK exports industry in Media ; programmes , formats and Technology. 
defaultI welcome the bringing of the BBC 
defaultWorld 
defaultS
defaultervice
default and 
defaultMonitoring
default 
defaultcloser
default within the BBC 
defaultFamily
default – and 
defaulthave
default noted the 
defaultimprovements

default 
defaultthe
default UK and 
defaultUK
default 
defaultinformation
default 
defaultto the
default 
defaultworld
default 
defaultthat
default this has 
defaultbrought
default, so meeting a public purpose
defaultThe 
defaultBBC introducing the WOCC has been of great benefit to the independent sector and has increased they richness on our screens – But it is import
defaultant for the BBC 
defaultn
defaultot to outsource all its production – because it is essential that the Commissioners have experts to consult and fall 
defaultback on   who can actually do a
default 
default(
defaultclose to
default)
default excellent job if called up on to do.
default 
defaultHowever
default to 
defaultperhaps
default make the WOCC to not more than 35% from the 25% it is now may give the 
defaultlittle
default more encouragement to the Indies without affecting BBC in house production. 
defaultIn 
defaultDigital 
defaultmedia
default and 
defaultRadio
default the 
defaultIndies
default market is less well 
defaultdefined
default 
defaultbut this may grow over the 
defaultnext
default Ch
defaultarter period. 
default&#xa0;
default How have the BBC’s commercial activities during the current Charter fitted with the BBC’s public purposes and have they achieved an adequate return for 
defaultlicense
default fee payers? What should be the aims, scope and scale of such activities beyond 
default2016?
defaultThe Role of BBC Worldwide has been batted about by politicians – and has generally been made to fit more the BBC public purposes than making a return which can augment the License fee.  
defaultThe suggestion to merge BBC Worldwide with Channel 4 was typica
defaultl of the way in which BBC W is seen as 
defaulta
default source of funding to be used as governments see fit. 
defaultI
default 
defaultwould
default like to see BBC World wide take a 
defaultmore commercial
default view – but very mindful of the BBC 
defaultindolence
default and PSB role 
default- and
default increase its mission to put 
defaultforward
default the
default UK in the 
defaultworld
default of 
defaultcommercial
default 
defaultmedia
default. 
defaultWhat role should the BBC play in developing technology and new ways of distributing content?
defaultI see that the BBC contains within the one 
defaultorganisation 
defaulttechnical staff (who I have had the pleasure of being my colleagues)
default who 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThus the BBC has a range of expert knowledgeable technological staff working for a varied organisation which by its public service requirements 
default, 
defaultincluding 
defaultu
defaultniversal
default delivery
default,
default means that the UK Public and the wider World audience are much cost effectively served to receive and easily access BBC content – by broadcasts and the internet.  
default&#xa0;
defaultIt would be very foolish to break up an organisation  which has these 
defaultEnd to end
default 
defaulttechnical skills so the BBC Should continue to have the 
defaultcapable 
defaultstaff and authority in its charter to  develop technology and new ways of providing the audience with content. 
default&#xa0;
default As a lemma 
defaultI feel that a lot of the Failing of the Digital Media Initiative 
defaultafter its successful 
defaultprototype deployment
default in BBC Scotland by Siemens 
defaultis
default due to the move to IT based staff 
defaultwho
default were not expert in, and did not
default 
defaulthave 
defaultunderstanding of
default, 
defaultc
defaultontent and its creators or how the wider broadcasting industry had moved
default&#xa0;
defaultHow should the BBC be funded beyond 2016? 
defaultIs there a case for distributing funding for public service content more widely beyond the BBC?
defaultWhat comparisons can be made with the provision of public service content in other 
defaultcountries?
default 
defaultI feel that 
defaultthat the 
defaultsuccesses have been 
defaultachieved
default by the role and 
defaultfunding
default that 
defaultthe 
defaultBBC has had for many 
defaultyears
default, and the 
defaultrole
default that 
defaultthe BBC
default 
defaulthas
default within the 
defaultcomplex
default UK 
defaultMedia
default 
defaultmarkets
default.
default 
defaultAny
default 
defaultLarge 
defaultchange to the scoping 
defaultor
default funding of the BBC 
defaultm
defaultay cause instability which destroys the UK'
defaults unique Media mix.
defaultI still feel that the license  fee as a method is still the most appropriate as the means of deriving a large part of the BBC income – as BBC services are freely available  for everyone to receive enjoy and benefit from.  
defaultIt is sad that
default it is such an emotive subject when the average 
defaulthousehold
default spends more than even a 
defaultrealistic
default (say £200/year) LF on each 
defaultof broadband and
default Pay 
defaultTV
default provision
default 
default– collectively at about 3 
defaulttimes
default 
defaultwhat they pay in License fee 
default 
defaultAlthough I think it was appropriate that
default the BBC should have funded the DSO Help schemes – I think that the fact that the underspend was returned to the Consolidated Fund was not an honest use of that money.
default 
defaultLikewise while I feel that the UK needs to expand the reach of Broadband to remote communities - This is a matter of wider Public policy that just PSB and this top slicing of the LF to provide this is an abuse of the trust that the viewer has in the licens
defaulte fee.  
defaultThe same may be said of the 
defaultstart-up
default 
defaultcost
default of 
defaultLocal
default TV 
default 
default All of these three 
defaultsubsides
default 
defaultare to with 
defaulttechnological mattersdefault – rather than content
default, which 
defaultis
default the 
defaultlife
default blood of the 
defaultBBC and what I think the public thinks that Their license  fees should support. 
default So I 
defaultcongratulate the
default way in which 
defaultthe
default BBC though 
defaultpartnerships is
default making its money available to partners like the Museums and National Performance orations to promote their w
defaultorth though the airwaves and internet. 
defaultLikewise
default the support that the BBC 
defaultg
defaultives
default S4C MG 
defaultAlba
default and the purchase of material from 
defaultLocal
default 
defaultTelevision
default are useful 
defaultinterventions
default to 
defaultsupport
default the 
defaultnone
default (or less
default) commercial
default 
defaultelement
default of PSB.
defaultHow should the BBC be governed, 
defaultregulated and held accountable beyond 2016?
defaultIn a constantly evolving communications environment, does a 10-year Royal Charter and Agreement with the Secretary of State, together, provide the most appropriate constitutional framework for the BBC?
default 
defaultThe exis
defaultting Charter has been shown to split responsibility between the BBC Trust and the 
defaultE
defaultxecutive which is NOT good and has in part been responsible for much of the alleged BBC 
defaulte
defaultxcesses. 
defaultThus a new charter must give a greater clarity and perhaps a slightly heav
defaultier touch monitoring of operational management whilst still being an arm’s length controlling body. 
defaultThere is a place for the 
defaultTrust
default to 
defaultpreserve
default the public interest and to ensure 
defaultclearly
default 
defaultvisible
default 
defaultindependence
default from 
defaultPolitical
default or 
defaultcommercial
default 
defaultpressures
default.  OFCOM as
default 
defaultsolely
default 
defaulta
default 
defaultregulator
default cannot do this. 
defaultAs for the period of the 
defaultcharter I
default 
defaultobserve
default that although the communications technical environment appears to be changing fast – many of the techniques are currently known, in many cases due to the pioneering work of the
default BBC whether in DVB-T2 or UHD2, or IPlayer and Television Adaptation Layer. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe one technological change that will occur over the next ten years is that more content will be delivered over IP to provide a more personal viewing experience – But the very e
defaultfficient and mass universal reach of through the air Televi
defaultsi
defaulton will still be the most important delivery platforms. 
defaultThe development cycles of many of these technologies approaches ten years from the first idea being demonstrated to the widespread take up of the technology by the audience and thus a period of much less than 10 years may not provide the forward looking vi
defaultew of 
defaultthe media and its technology. 
defaultA
defaultlthough
default 
defaultthe 
defaultBBC Is, and should be in the future, an 
defaultinnovative
default 
defaultcontent
default 
defaultprovider
default – over the 
defaultperiod of 
default a ten 
defaultyear

defaultcharter

defaulto
defaultffering
default 
defaultas the 
defaultmajority
default TV and web PSB
default and the sole Radio PSB 
defaultsee
defaultn
default to meet the public good. 
defaultI 
defaulthope
default that the 
defaultnew
default 
defaultcharter
default will give the BBC itself the space and 
defaultincentives
default to develop 
defaultand react
default or lead the changes which the 
defaultPopulation
default of the UK will demand – as they use and 
defaultexploit
default 
defaulttechnology
default fo
defaultr the public good. 
defaultThe BBC has changed over any period of its life – it must be given the funding and governance to allow it to do so accountably to the Public – of the UK who fund it and the world who use it. 
defaultFinally I recognise the creativity
default,
default determin
defaultation and impartiality of the BBC staff and contributors who are what have made the BBC over the years – and form the best and very accountable broadcaster and information disseminator in the world. 
defaultIt must not be allowed to be destroyed.
