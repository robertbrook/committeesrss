The exceptional funding scheme established in the Bill will provide funding for an excluded case where failure to do so would amount to a breach of a person's right to legal \naid under the Human Rights Act or European Union law. \nLord McNally\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n59. Proceedings relating to the immigration status of immigrants and decisions relating to the entry, stay and deportation of immigrants do not involve the determination of civil rights and obligations [footnote: \nMaaouia\n v France (2001) 33 \nEHRR 42; \nEskelinen\n v Finland (2007) 45 EHRR 43 \n13.]\n&#xa0;\n60. The Lord Chancellor does not consider that there is anything in the current case law that would put the State under a legal obligation to provide legal aid in immigration proceedings\n…\n to meet the procedural requirements of Article 8 ECHR. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCase A (from meeting with Exceptional Cases Team of 1 July)Applicant lacked capacity in the technical sense. There was no one to instruct t\nhe litigation friend. The official solicitor had given instructions for an application for exceptional funding to be made. This was refused. The refusal of funding suggested that the applicant (and official solicitor) read the exceptional funding guidance \nwith care.\n&#xa0;\nCase 2 (from meeting with exceptional cases team of 1 July)The applicant was blind and suffering from dementia, at imminent risk of street homelessness. Exceptional funding refused.\n&#xa0;\nCase of NAppellant is a seven year old child with autism. \nBorn in the UK and has lived all his life here. He is here with mother, neither have any status. Her appeal was dismissed but solicitors managed to pursue his appeal to the Upper Tribunal Immigration and Asylum Chamber before the Legal Aid, Sentencing and \nPunishment of Offenders act 2013 came into force (at which point it would not have received funding.  The appeal was dismissed by the Upper Tribunal but permission was granted permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal. The case was then remitted to the U\npper Tribunal but by then there was no legal aid for the case. The application for exceptional funding was refused. The not for profit organisation dealing with the case applied for a review.  The Tribunal refused an adjournment and suggested that the not \nfor profit represent for free or that he pays privately (his mother is in receipt of asylum support).  On the eve of the hearing, the Home Office granted leave\n.\n  Meanwhile the Legal Aid Agency reviewed its decision on exceptional funding and upheld the ref\nusal.\n&#xa0;\nCase of OA 17 year old, in care in the UK since he was a young child and facing deportation. In the end this case was funded by the local authority subsequent to a letter threatening judicial review if they did not fund.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Case of GFamily reunific\nation case.  Child in care.  Applying to be reunited with a child she had had when very young as a result of rape. Application for exceptional funding refused.  Such cases involve commissioning and arranging DNA tests. The child remains overseas, no applic\nation having yet been made to bring them to the UK.\n&#xa0;Case of CC is a schizophrenic, detained in an immigration removal centre.  He has two British citizen children with whom he has supervised contact. He faces deportation. Exceptional funding refused.  Su\nbsequently counsel was instructed through the Bar Pro Bono Unit and discretionary leave granted.\n&#xa0;Trafficking cases (x two)Both cases had been referred to the Home Office as the “competent authority” under the National Referral Mechanism to determine \nwhether there were reasonable grounds for thinking that the applicants had been trafficked.  No reasonable grounds decision has been made in either case – delays continue for many months.  Therefore applications for exceptional funding were made as advice \nwould not wait. Both applications were refused.  The reason given was that the case is outside the scope of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSubsequent to the Government response to the consultation&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCivil legal aid claimants are assumed to continue to achieve\n the same case outcomes from non-legally aided means of resolution (e.g. resolve the issue themselves or pay privately to resolve the issue).\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe residence test&#xa0;\nIncompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“4.16 In our view, proceedings where the litigant is seeking to hold the state to account by judicial review are important, because these cases are the means by which individual citizens can seek to check the exercise of executive\n power by appeal to the judiciary.

She was held not to have been trafficked because of decisions about her credibility which were entirely bas\ned on a lack of understanding of trafficking indicators and patterns. She has now been accepted to be a trafficked person.\n&#xa0;CC’s age was disputed.  She was pregnant as a result of rape by her trafficker and being\n \nlooked after by a relative. It was propose\nd to remove her on third country grounds to the\n \ncountry into which she had been trafficked, separating her from the relative.  The decision\n \nthat there were not reasonable grounds for thinking that she had not been trafficked was\n \nchallenged and overturned b\nut she then got a negative “conclusive” grounds decision. “Dublin” removal was again proposed even though she still lived with the relative and had\n \na young baby.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Babies under 12 months old &#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDetention cases &#xa0;Paragraph 5: \n              \nMental Capacity Act challenges\nParagraph 20: \n              \nhabeas corpus applications\nParagraph 25: \n              \nchallenges to immigration detention\nParagraph 26 \n              \nchallenges to refusa\nls to gran\nt temporary admission\nParagraph 27 \n              \nchallenges to conditions on release from detention\nParagraph 19 \n              \njudicial review \nof \nthe lawfulness of immigration detention \n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI am driven to conclude that the claimants’ detention was deliberately planned with a view to what in my judgment was a collateral and improper purpose - the \nspiriting away of the claimants from the jurisdiction before there was likely to be time for them to obtain and act upon legal advice or apply to the court. That purpose was improper. It was unlawful. And in my judgment it renders the detention itself unla\nwful.\n&#xa0;\nWhat the present case and others like it reveal, in my judgment, is at best an unacceptable disregard by the Home Office of the rule of law, at worst an unacceptable disdain by the Home Office for the rule law, which is as depressing as it ought to \nbe concerning.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.53…We consider that cases where state agents are alleged to have abused their position of power, significantly breached human rights, or are \nalleged to have been responsible for negligent acts or omissions falling very far below the required standard of care have an importance beyond a simple money claim. We consider that these cases are an important means to hold public authorities to account \nand to ensure that state power is not misused. We consider that the class of individuals bringing these claims is not necessarily likely to be particularly vulnerable and some cases will be suitable for funding through C\n[\nonditonal\n] \nF\n[\nee\n] A[arrangement]s\n. H\nowever, we believe that the determining factor is the role of such cases in ensuring that the power of public authorities is not misused…\n&#xa0;\nTrafficked persons&#xa0;&#xa0;\nIf legal aid is not available until there has been a reasonable-grounds decision, will the Border Agency put the immigration case on hold? In the meantime, what happens if the individual is in detention or is without housing and food? \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOOO &amp; ors [2011] EWHC 1246 (QB)The claimants succeeded in establishing that the police had violated \ntheir Article 4 rights by failing to investigate their allegations. At the time of the proceedings the claimants were a\nmixture of those who were still seeking asylum and \none (OOO) who had been granted\nstatus by the time she applied for funding but who had\n had it for less than a year.\n \n&#xa0;\nWW was accepted to meet all parts of the definition of \ntrafficking definition, having been exploited for\n \ndomestic servitude and forced prostitution, yet deemed not to be a victim because she had “moved\n \non” by continuing to\n attend therapy.\n&#xa0;\nFF was trafficked for domestic servitude. Her visa expired in August 2012. Her traffickers (who had control of her passport, and her movements. made an in-time application for an extension of her visa. In November 2012 she escaped her traffickers, who wrote\n then to the Home Office in her name, withdrawing the application and saying that she wanted to return home. In response, the Home Office sent her application papers and her passport to her previous employers' address, in December 2012 - despite having bee\nn notified in writing that all correspondence should go to \nKalayaan\n, a charity working \nwith migrant domestic workers. Her Embassy was unable to obtain her passport from the previous employers.    She was now working for a new employer - but unlawfully, sin\nce her application had been withdrawn with her knowledge or intention, as \nKalayaan\n discovered when they made enquiries of the Home Office.   A specialised organisation providing legal advice to trafficked persons helped her to pursue a claim against her tr\naffickers in the Employment Tribunal, and an out of time application for further leave as a migrant domestic. This was granted because of compassionate circumstances.  At no stage was F referred to eh National Referral Mechanism for a decision that she was\n a trafficked person.  She preferred to be self-supporting since her family was dependent on her salary.   \n&#xa0;\nHad she gone to her lawyers after 1 April 2014, to get legal aid she would have to have been referred to the National Referral Mechanism which would have delayed her application for a visa by possibly several months.  Meanwhile she would have remained unla\nwfully in the UK, and lost an opportunity to remain self-supporting by work. Delay would also have prejudiced the visa application. If the residence test were implemented then were she to receive a negative 'reasonable grounds' decision, she would have no \nway of challenging that by way of judicial review, because the residence test would kick in. \nAA is a trafficked person. He fled his country during a family feud which cost the life of his brother and saw him violently attacked.  The agent who helped him \nto flee in 2009 took his passport and he was made to undertake forced \nlabour\n for the next five years in a restaurant, working seven days a week. He\n slept on a mattress on the floor of the food store room and was never paid more than £60 a week. He was thre\natened that immigration would remove him. He met his partner at a the restaurant and went to live with her.  They have two children and expect a third.  She and the children have recently been granted settlement.  His case is complex because he escaped tra\nfficking some time ago.  He needs advice on his options.  Even if he were to claim asylum there is currently no legal aid for his claim based on Article 8. An application for exceptional funding was made to o\nbtain evidence in support of his Article 8 claim\n while the decision under the National Referral Mechanism is awaited and make the appropriate applications insofar as these were not asylum cases and thus out of scope.  Exceptional funding was refused and this was upheld on review. An \napplication for judi\ncial review of the Legal Aid Agency was prepared.  The Agency maintains its decision.  \nAfter several attempts, emergency legal aid funding to challenge the Legal Aid Agency's refusal of exceptional funding was obtained; the case is pending. It has taken al\nmost six months to get his case for access to legal aid before a judge - although Article 12 of Directive 2011/36/EU, the \nDirective of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2011 on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and pr\notecting its victims\n states that victims of trafficking are entitled to 'early legal advice'.   The residence test would make it impossible to bring the challenge to the refusal of funding.\n \n&#xa0;LydiaLydia was referred to her representatives in March 2013 by \nKalayaan\n, a charity assisting migrant domestic workers.  She had been trafficked to the UK from the Philippines for the purposes of domestic servitude and forced to work up to 15 hours a day, 7 day\ns a week. Lydia’s passport was taken from her and she was not allowed to leave the house unaccompanied. She was paid £139 per month paid into an account in her home country. In late 2011, when the traffickers travelled abroad Lydia escaped. She obtained ne\nw employment but her new employer similarly exploited her.  Complaints met with threats of denunciation to the police and other authorities, as an illegal worker.  When she sought to leave she was subjected to both verbal and physical abuse and imprisoned.\n When two days later the door was unlocked so that the employer could go to work Lydia, having taken employers’ children to school, fled.  \nLydia issue breach of contracted and protection from harassment proceedings against her second employer, these compl\naints to be heard in mid-2014. Under the post 1 April 2013 funding regime Lydia would not receive legal aid as only complaints raised directly against the trafficker will be funded.  If the proposals were implemented Lydia would thus also not benefit from \nthe exemption from the residence test. \n&#xa0;\nVictims of domestic violence and forced marriage&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nParagraph 11   \nN\non-molestation orders, injunctions, inherent jurisdiction of the High \nCourt to protect an adult\nParagraph 12   \nF\namily law matters where a person is or has been a victim or at risk \n of b\neing a victim of domestic violence\nParagraph 13   Family law orders for an adult where a child is at risk of abuse from \nanother adult\nParagraph 16   Forced marriage protection orders\nParagraph 28   Immigration applications under the domestic violence rule\nParagraph 29   EU Free movement la\nw matters where the applicant is a survivor of \ndomestic violence\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nProtection of children cases &#xa0;\nParagraph 1\n              \ncare proceedings\nParagraph 3\n              \ncivil actions relating to abuse that took place when a person \nwas a child \nParagraph 9 \n              \nproceedings involving the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court in relation to children (\nwardship\n etc.) \nParagraph 10 \n              \nCases involving child abduction\nParagraph 15 \n              \nChildren who are parties to family proceedings and \nParagraph 23 \n              \nCa\nses i\nnvolving clinica\nl negligence &amp;\n severely disabled children\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhilst Article 8 contains no explicit procedural requirements, the decision-making process \ninvolved in measures of interference must be fair and such as to afford due \nrespect to the int\nerests safeguarded by Article 8\n.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.7 Children should have the right to their own legal counsel and representation, in their own name, in proceedings where there is, or could be, a conflict of interest between the child and the parents or other involv\ned parties.\n&#xa0;\n3.8 Children should have access to free legal aid, under the same or more lenient conditions as adults.\n&#xa0;\nSpecial Immigration Appeals Commissions&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Summary of the effects of the residence test &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe residence test will deny legal aid for, \ninter alia\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nRestrictions on legal aid for those in prisons&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe third essent\nial building block of provision is to ensure that all foreign nationals are prepared for their eventual removal or release. All of them need to know, as early as possible in sentence, whether or not it is proposed to deport or remove them. They need to hav\ne access to appropriate regimes: not only to reduce the risk of reoffending, wherever they are released, but also because safety, security and decency within prisons depend upon prisoners having access to purposeful activity\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe LAA has indicated that of the 11 treatment cases to receive prior approval since July 2010 a significant proportion have involved prisoners with learning difficulties and/or mental health issues. The proposal could therefore potentially have an impa\nct on this group of prisoners. \n&#xa0;\n…i\ns unnecessarily vague.  It should be possible among a mere 11 cases to quantify the “significant proportion.”  It is unclear why it is \nsaid that \nimpact is potential only.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Judicial Review&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.16 In our view, proceedings where the litigant is seeking to hold the state to account by judicial review are important, because these cases are the means by which individual citi\nzens can seek to check the exercise of executive power by appeal to the judiciary. These proceedings therefore represent a crucial way of ensuring that state power is exercised responsibly.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n..The agency struggles with the volume of i\nts casework, which has led to historical backlogs running into the hundreds of thousands; the number of illegal immigrants removed does not keep up with the number of people who are here illegally…the agency has been a troubled organisation since it was fo\nrmed in 2008, and its performance is not good enough.\n…it has conflicting cultures and all too often focuses on the crisis in hand at the expense of other important work; the second is its lack of transparency and\n \naccountability; the third is its inadequat\ne IT systems; and the fourth is the policy\n \nand\n \nlegal framework within which it has to operate. … IT systems are often incompatible and are not reliable enough. They require manual data entry instead of automated data collection, and they often involve pape\nr files instead of modem electronic case management. \n…\nThe agency is often caught up in a vicious cycle of complex law and poor enforcement of its own policies, which makes it harder to remove people who are here illegally. …\nUKBA has been a troubled \norganisation for so many years. It has poor IT systems, and it operates within a complicated legal framework that often works against it. All those things mean that it will take many years to clear the backlogs\n and fix the system ...\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCase of DD arrived as a child, had Discretionary Leave and applied in-time on form HPDL [Humanitarian Protection/Discretionary Leave, a\n form which does not carry a fee] for an extension. Six years later the Home Office rejected his application as invalid. Solicitors wrote chasing letters and eventually a pre-action protocol letter to no avail and lodged an application for judicial review \non the basis that their own policy said they were roughly five and three quarter years out of time to reject the application as invalid. The Home Office lodged summary grounds asserting that he should still re-apply because they were entitled to be paid a \nfee for the application because it should have been made on FLR (O) [Further Leave to Remain (Other) – form for which a fee is payable].  The case was listed for hearing.  It was argued that back in 2006 when the application was made there was no fee for t\nhe application that the Home Office said he should have made and they conceded before the hearing.  In that case costs were paid.\n&#xa0;Case of RThe application was rejected as invalid as invalid for use of the wrong form after more than three months.  The Hom\ne Office website had directed the claimant to the form which the Home Office later said was invalid.  The Home Office did not back down until proceedings were issued.  They paid the claimants’ costs.\n&#xa0;\nR(S) v SSHD [2011] EWHC 2120 (Admin) (05 August 2011) \nIn this case the detention of a mentally ill man was found to be unlawful, in breach of Article 5 of, and to breach Article 3 of, the European Convention on human rights.  S was held in immigration detention at the end of his criminal sentence (all of whic\nh he had served on remand).  Copious medical reports had been produced and he had been transferred to hospital. He was identified as a suicide risk and subject to hourly observations.  \nFollowing a transfer to hospital a request for temporary admission was \nrefused.  Judicial review proceedings were issued, a permission hearing was expedited. The judge observed “\nEven Dr Ahmed's report of 24 June failed to lead UKBA to bring the matter to a resolution until another 5-6 weeks had passed and the order of this Co\nurt had been obtained on 28 July…\n.In my judgment, the circumstances of S's detention passed the high threshold required for a violation of Article 3 and amounted to inhuman or degrading treatment. I find that there here was a breach of both the negative an\nd positive aspects of Article 3”.\n&#xa0;\nR(HA) (Nigeria), v SSHD (Rev 1) [2012] EWHC 979 (Admin) (17 April 2012)\nHA was also mentally ill and because of this was transferred to hospital.  Lawyers issued a judicial review challenging the lawfulness of his \ndetention and asking for confirmation that he would not be transferred back to prison. No substantive response was provided before the application for judicial review was lodged on 28 October 2010.\n Then came a letter maintaining detention and he was indeed\n transferred back to detention. On 5 November On 15 December 2010 bail was granted unopposed. His detention from \n1 February to 5 July 2010 and from 5 November to 15 December 2010 was held to be in breach of Article 3 of the European Convention on\n Human Rig\nhts. The Judge held “\nThe length of time that it took to secure the Claimant's transfer to hospital between 1 February and 5 July 2010 was manifestly unreasonable and unlawful.”\n&#xa0;\nIn the case below there was no order as to costs\n.\n&#xa0;\nFF was a young woman from Eritrea who had been recognised as a refugee.  The Local Authority stopped the support that had been provided to her as a Former Relevant Child under the Children (Leaving Care) \nAct 2000. – refugee status granted.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Her then legal \nrepresentatives missed the deadline for judicial review. She had to drop out of education.  She applied for and got Job Seekers Allowance. She made what her current lawyers describes as “literally hundreds of job applications” but got nowhere as she had no\n experience and English was not great.\n&#xa0;\n She wanted support from the Local Authority to start to study again and gain the skills to make her employable.  Her current legal representatives took on the case a year after the deadline for judicial review from t\nhe date her support stopped had passed, but arguing that the failure to support her was an “ongoing failure” and as such that deadline did not apply.  Permission was refused, but the application was renewed and succeeded.  The case was settled the case sho\nrtly thereafter with no order as to costs on the basis that she got a very good package of support, greatly increasing her chances of employability in the future. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHer lawyer observes that although the underlying case was good the risks were high because \nof the delay and it would not be taken on if the proposed funding
