[normal]Supplementary[bold] follow up w[bold]ritten evidence from [bold]NHS England[bold] ([bold]LTC[bold]0[bold]116)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I gave oral evidence to the House of Commons Health Committee hearing on Management of Long Term Conditions on 12 November 2013. During that session I offered to send the committee a note on the definition of frailty in patients.  The National Clinical Director for Integration and Frailty, John Young, has kindly drafted a note.  That note is attached.
[normal]NHS England will be continuing to work to ensure that there is greater understanding of the nature and importance of frailty and ways of addressing it proactively.

[normal]De
[normal]scription 
[normal]of frailty
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Frailty is 
[normal]a distinctive health state related to 
[normal]the 
[normal]ageing process in which multiple body systems gradually lose their in-built reserve
[normal]s. 
[normal] 
[normal]This means the person is vulnerable to dramatic, sudden changes in health triggered by seemingly small 
[normal]events
[normal] such as a minor infection or
[normal] a change in 
[normal]medication. A person with frailty therefore typically presents in crisis with the “classic” frailty syndromes of delirium (acute confusion); sudden immobility (stuck in a chair or in bed); or a fall (and subsequent unsafe walking). 
[normal]There is a strong evidence base that r
[normal]apid (within two hours) 
[normal]medical assessment
[normal],
[normal] followed by 
[normal]specific treatment and 
[normal]a period o
[normal]f supportive and rehabilitation 
[normal]care
[normal],
[normal] is associated with improved outcomes (lower mortality; greater independence; and reduced need for long-term care). Much of t
[normal]h
[normal]is urgent care 
[normal]response to frailty is
[normal] currently done in hospitals by Geriatric Medicine departments (
[normal]Geriatric Medicine is now the largest medical speciality in England). 
[normal]For example, there are over 640,000 hospital admissions for older people with frailty related falls each year. Increasingly
[normal],
[normal] crisis 
[normal]assessment 
[normal]and management 
[normal]of older people with frailty is being done in the person’s home (“admission avoidance”)
[normal]. T
[normal]his requires 
[normal]the provision of 
[normal]dedicated
[normal], well led,
[normal] multi-disciplinary 
[normal]community 
[normal]teams. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Frailty develops slowly over 5 to 10 years
[normal]:
[normal] so c
[normal]ould more be done to help older people with frailty before a health crisis occurs? 
[normal] 
[normal]Older people with frailty 
[normal]can be readily identified and are usually well known to local health and social care professionals. They 
[normal]usually have weak muscles and also often have other conditions like arthritis, poor eyesight, 
[normal]deafness and 
[normal]memory problems. This means that frail older people typically walk slowly, get exhausted easily and struggle to get out of a chair or climb stairs. They are therefore more likely to become dependent on others for day-to-day cares and are at higher risk of future admission to a care home
[normal]. At present, however, we do not formally “diagnose” frailty
[normal] or identify it with a specific “code”. This means systematic case finding and proactive care is difficult. Slow walking speed is a simple test that could readily help identify people who are frail. Taking more than 5 seconds to walk 4 metres is highly indicative of frailty. The 
[normal]primary care electronic health record contains 
[normal]large amounts of 
[normal]health data from which selected existing items could be readily brought together to form a “Frailty Index” to identify the sub-group of older people who have frailty, and to grade the frailty state. This would allow a structured self-management plan for people with mild/moderate frailty and case management (multi-disciplinary assessment and individualised care planning) for people with moderate/severe frailty.
