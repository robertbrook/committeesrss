[[[&#xa0;]]]The government’s strategyImmunisation and anti-microbial agents, particularly antibiotics, have made an enormous contribution to control of infectious disease and reduction of early death in the UK and throughout the world.  However, as emphasised in the Chief Medical Officer’s Annual report, AMR is now a major problem.  Important contributory factors include inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics and their routine use in animal husbandry as growth promoters.&#xa0;The government’s strategy on AMR focuses on: &#xa0;While these are important, in our view the focus is too narrow.  This is essentially a convergent, ‘more of the same’ approach.  Unless there is a turnaround in the long-term downward trend in antibiotic discovery, this strategy will slow the spread of AMR, but not reverse it.   &#xa0;The evidence in the CMO’s report is largely hospital based with little reference to primary care and no mention of self-care.  Yet most inappropriate antibiotic prescribing occurs in primary care for self-limiting viral upper respiratory tract infections, despite numerous public health campaigns advising symptomatic measures such as rest, paracetamol and increased fluid intake rather than antibiotics for colds, coughs and sore throats. &#xa0;We advocate a more divergent approach incorporating, in addition to the measures proposed in the CMO’s Annual Report, research into other treatment options.  In particular, we believe that the potential of integrating traditional and traditioanl and complementary medicine methods, and the promotion of safe and appropriate self-care should be investigated.  &#xa0;Primary care research projects on herbal medicine in infectious diseaseA number of research projects with implications for AMR in, particularly around herbal treatment, are in progress at the National School for Primary Care Research.  These include:&#xa0;&#xa0;Projects submitted for funding, or in advanced development include:&#xa0;The clinical input in all these studies has involved collaboration between primary care departments within the NIHR National School for Primary Care Research.    The UCL School of Pharmacy has provided phytopharmacy input.  These projects reflect a sustained strategy designed to provide alternatives to antibiotics in primary care, led by departments of research excellence and high quality researchers including Prof Paul Little (Southampton University), Prof Chris Butler (Cardiff and Oxford University) and Prof Simon Gibbons (UCL School of Pharmacy)&#xa0;Promising herbal medicinesCurrent evidence and systematic reviews suggest that herbs may have specific effects on acute infections and may also act synergistically with conventional medicines including antibiotics to diminish the risk of AMR. &#xa0;In the absence of effective antiviral orthodox therapy for self-limiting non-threatening viral infections, which are sometimes inappropriately treated with antibiotics or maybe complicated by bacterial superinfection, a number of herbal extracts have potential.  These include: Andrographis paniculata, Pelargonium sidoides (a species of geranium), Echinacea species, garlic, and Sambucus nigra (elderberry), all of these are currently available in the UK as registered herbal medicines, and have shown promise in clinical trials for treatment or prevention of the common cold, acute bronchitis and sinusitis, and influenza. [2-7]The evidence suggests that they may act directly as antiviral agents and also stimulate boost immune system anti-viral activity. Replication of these results in independent, large, high quality clinical trials (such as is currently planned for Pelargonium), combined with education of healthcare practitioners, community pharmacists, and the public, have the potential to enhance self-care, reduce GP attendances and antibiotic prescriptions, and allow patients to receive effective treatment for self-limiting viral illnesses.The potential of herbs and plant extracts to potentiate antibiotics is a promising area for development, this includes some of the most dangerous antimicrobial resistant organisms.  At present most such work is preliminary and laboratory-based. But a recent review found evidence that 34 herbs may have such effects. &#xa0; For example resistant E. coli when combined with extracts of Sophora alopecuroides became susceptible to ciproﬂoxacin.  For MRSA Berberine, found in several medicinal plants, when combined the antibiotics levofloxacin and azithromycin (to which MRSA is resistant) restored their efficacy.[8-9]That Several Chinese medicine plants have promising direct (ie without being combined with antibiotics) anti-MRSA possibilities, these include Dendrobenthamia capitata, Elsholtzia rugulosa, Elsholtzia blanda, Geranium strictipes, Polygonum multiflorum.  [10-11].

[[[&#xa0;]]]HomeopathyHomeopathy is controversial but is associated with reduced use of antibiotics in upper respiratory tract infections, an important source of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing in primary care.  This may be a result of the enhanced self-care that frequently occurs when patients seek and self-manage with CAM or it may be a specific effect. &#xa0;A Health Technology Assessment commissioned by the Swiss Federal government found 29 clinical trials of homeopathy for upper respiratory tract infection or allergies found 29 clinical studies of which 24 were positive for homeopathy.   When the 16 randomised placebo-controlled, trials only were analysed 8/16 were found to be statistically significantly positive, 4/16 showed a positive trend. Of trials comparing homeopathy with conventional treatment, 6/7 trials showed at least equivalence: 1/7 superior to conventional treatment, 5/7 equivalent to conventional treatment, one showed homeopathy to be inferior to conventional treatment (homeopathy v penicillin for streptococcal pharyngitis or tonsillitis).   The conclusion for homeopathy is ‘probable effectiveness’. [12]&#xa0;A study published since this Health Technology Assessment, supported by the Indian Ministry of Health involved collaboration between conventional ENT specialists and homeopathic doctors in a randomised controlled trial of homeopathy v conventional treatment in acute otitis media.  The outcomes at 3 weeks were not significantly different, but the numbers of antibiotic prescriptions in the homeopathically-treated group were much lower. [13-14]&#xa0;Other evidence relevant to AMR includes preliminary clinical trial data suggesting that homeopathy may improve outcomes of critically-ill patients in intensive care units, and that it may be an effective treatment for E coli diarrhoea in newborn piglets. [15-16]&#xa0;Developing self care Self-care is strongly associated with use of traditional and complementary medicine. There is huge potential to develop self-care with traditional and complementary medicine to manage the symptoms of acute infections and thus avoid patients requesting antibiotics.  &#xa0;Training community pharmacists in evidence based understanding of traditional and complementary based approaches to self-care in acute self-limiting infections would increase their opportunist repertoire and allow patients who prefer such interventions more treatment options.  NHS Direct should provide appropriate guidance to the public.  In another domain (cancer), the website of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre in New York City is an exemplar of public information on integrative medicine. [17]&#xa0;ConclusionsTraditional and complementary medicine methods have great potential for avoiding or averting the use of antibiotics, potentiating their effectiveness, and as novel antimicrobial agents.&#xa0;In addition, traditional and complementary medicine is strongly associated with self-care.  With appropriate promotion of their safe use and training of health care professionals, this can make a significant contribution to the reduction of inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents.&#xa0;Considering its potential traditional and complementary medicine for AMR is greatly under researched.  Its potential should be taken into account in developing national AMR policy.&#xa0;References 1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/ARC/Pages/Whatareantibiotics.aspx2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Coon JT, Ernst E.
