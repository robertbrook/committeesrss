&#xa0;Written evidence from Sanjeev Appicharla (CYS0110)&#xa0;&#xa0;The aim of the Submission is to inform the decision making process of the Chair and Members of Transport Select Committee by advancing support for the arguments presented and correcting an error in the probabilistic argument in the earlier Written Evidence dated 08 Jan 2014. &#xa0;&#xa0;During the last 10 years or so, he has specialised in the activity of modelling and analysis of safety critical system and accidents following the generalising the hazard identification and analysis process and information decision making framework contained in the IEC 61508, a generic safety standard, to conduct hazard identification and analysis using the engineering analytical fault Management Oversight and Risk Tree and Human factors Framework, Skills-Rules and Knowledge Framework.  &#xa0;Author‘s expertise in system safety engineering research is evidenced by the publications of six peer reviewed publications at the Institute of Engineers and Technology ( IET) International System Safety Conferences in 2006, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Author worked as a Command Controls Signalling Engineer promoting the idea of System Approach to Safety at RSSB from 2004 till 2010.  &#xa0;&#xa0;Using the published data, the pattern of Poisson distribution is used to infer occurrences of fatalities and result of Excel sheet calculations are published in the following text. These figures can be verified by readers to be correct or wrong. &#xa0;Author does not envisage greater mathematical effort to be applied into statistics awareness for the purposes of risk management. This is because the pattern of causality is evident from the hazard identification and analysis in the earlier paper by the author. The results of statistical analysis indicated that there are high chances of fatalities to recur if there is no intervention. Reason for  that non-repeating  of pattern of accidents at Bow Roundabout can be attributed to learning of the hazardous nature of the Bow Roundabout by cyclists and motor vehicle drivers alike. When memories fade patterns re-appear. &#xa0;Argument that there is small size of data is refuted by using Poisson distribution applies to rare events by an uninterested observer. &#xa0;The behavioural pattern observed in the data (outlier) coinciding with financial crisis of 2008 is a project waiting further research. &#xa0;data&#xa0;Poisson Distribution20&#xa0;88.94%19&#xa0;83.91%8&#xa0;2.73%21&#xa0;92.68%19&#xa0;83.91%15&#xa0;50.69%15&#xa0;50.69%13&#xa0;30.83%10&#xa0;9.21%16&#xa0;60.56%1&#xa0;0.000279%Expected Mean15.6&#xa0;Expected Median15.5&#xa0;Expected Mode19&#xa0;Variance18.71111&#xa0;Std deviation4.325634&#xa0;Confidence Interval2.681007&#xa0;Maximum fatality18.28101&#xa0;Minimum fatality12.91899&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Nobel Prize winning psychologist, Daniel Kahneman, argues that people are prone to apply causal thinking inappropriately; to situations that require statistical reasoning. Statistical thinking derives conclusions about individual cases from properties of categories and ensembles. Unfortunately, System 1 does not have capability for this mode of reasoning: System 2 can learn to think statically, but few people receive the training. He writes that psychology of causality was the basis of the decision to describe psychological processes by metaphors of agency, with little concern for consistency (pp77) (Kahneman, 2011). &#xa0;Author argues that engineers do get trained in the use of statistics and probability, but they do not appreciate the errors they introduce into their reasoning when they confound intentional and physical causality.  Several examples of this nature emerge from the consideration of scientific literature since Rene Descartes time. Arthur Schopenhauer (1813) gives an example of heat, a property of matter, being the cause of rising quicksilver in a thermometer as an example of physical causality(pp155) (Schopenhaeur, 1813/2006).   Arthur Schopenhauer (1813) refuted Rene Descartes’s ontological argument for God by saying that the immensity of God is a logical reason, from which it follows, that God needs no cause; whereas Rene Descartes confounds the two together and obviously has no clear consciousness of the difference between reason and cause. Properly speaking however, it is his intention which mars his insight. &#xa0;The Descartes error of dualism between the world of objects (soulless bodies) and world of mental subjects (bodies less souls) makes appearance in the writings of Daniel Kahneman drawing upon writings of Paul Bloom (pp77) (Kahneman, 2011). Psychologist Paul Bloom writes on his website that there is considerable evidence that adults are natural dualists--we see the world as Descartes did, as containing physical things (or bodies) and social entities (or souls). I am interested in how this common-sense dualism emerges in development, and the implications that it has for domains such as morality and religion. &#xa0;Managers and engineers, author speculates, without the background in design of systems, are prone to confound reasoning about intentional and physical causation. This can be treated as a representative bias which appears in reasoning over human error frequently in accident investigations (pp149) (Kahneman, 2011). Every policy decision on risk and safety involves assumptions about human nature, in particular about choices that people may make and the consequences of choices for themselves and society. The Exhibition Road has become safer because there is less chance of interaction between pedestrians and motorised vehicles because British vehicles drivers use a parallel road after hundred million pound investment, but few exemplary organisations think otherwise. Managers and engineers who made decisions on planning and delivery of technological projects and associated activities rarely appear on the radar of the accident investigator investigating a particular rare event in operations that has led to fatalities.&#xa0;Author did not find evidence that Danish Roads afford any more safety to cyclists than British Roads from the limited information available on the Web article.1&#xa0; More details can be located here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution&#xa0; More details can be located here:  http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/On_the_Fourfold_Root_of_the_Principle_of_Sufficient_Reason More details can be located here: http://psychology.yale.edu/faculty/paul-bloom More details can be located here: http://www.redcross.org.uk/What-we-do/Teaching-resources/Newsthink/Discussion-store/Shared-spaces&#xa0; More details can be located here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_in_Denmark
