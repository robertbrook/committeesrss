[[[case for ]]]

[[[a Resolution ]]]No longer is ministerial responsibility merely an unwritten constitutional Convention… It is now a clear parliamentary rule, set down in resolutions by both Houses of Parliament… The government acting on its own cannot now change the terms [of this Convention] in the way that the Conservative government did throughout its period in office. In other words, once a Convention is given concrete form through embodiment in a parliamentary resolution, it may not be unilaterally altered by the government of the day as a way of easing the constraints that conventions impose on government action when they become irksome.  Passing such a resolution places the content of the Convention in the keeping of Parliament – the body responsible for checking the executive - rather than with the executive itself. In turn this deals with a key weakness of Conventions generally: that those bound by them are often responsible for defining and redefining their content, and may use that power to water down or even emasculate the norm that is meant to bind them.  &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[The views of the House of Lords Constitution Committee]]]

[[[ against formalisation of the convention. ]]]in an area as important as the use of armed force abroad, the norm should be that the Government provide Parliament with the opportunity to exercise prospective oversight of executive decision-making. &#xa0;The Report added that it was:&#xa0;inconceivable that the Prime Minister would either refuse to allow a Commons debate and vote on a deployment decision, or would refuse to follow the view of the Commons as expressed by a vote. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;‘In some instances Parliament might want to grant consent subject to constraints on the type of action that may be undertaken. This could harm military effectiveness and limit commanders' freedom of manoeuvre.’ &#xa0;&#xa0;This however is quite plainly beside the point: since there is already a Convention that Parliament be consulted, Parliament could already grant its consent in this way. This objection is thus simply irrelevant to the question whether the already existing Convention should be formalised. Whether this happens or not, in any future case of proposed military action, the terms on which any consent might be granted would be set down in the specific government motion put down for approval in the House. The issue the Committee raises is to do with the terms upon which Parliament should grant its consent to military action – as it must already do – and has nothing to do with the issue under discussion, which is whether or not the existing Convention should be formalised.   &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The House of Commons has secured a commitment from the Government that any decision to arm the Syrian National Coalition should be taken only after the Commons has voted on the matter. Provision of arms to a conflict such as that in Syria was not a scenario envisaged by previous proposals for formalising Parliament's role, yet a process has been crafted by which the House of Commons will have its say. This demonstrates the benefits of flexibility. &#xa0;The suggestion seems to be, that, had a resolution been passed, limiting the convention to instances in which the Government planned to take military action, that somehow the Commons could not have secured the commitment to a vote before arming the rebels. This however is clearly not the case: the commitment was secured because many MPs felt strongly about the issue and were able to pass a motion. This could happen in future, regardless of whether any resolution on consultation over force were passed. A resolution requiring a vote before using military force does not preclude votes on other issues, should the House wish to hold them. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
