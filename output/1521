default&#xa0;defaultSummary
defaulta)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNorthumberland County Council covers a large area, including many isolated communities (both in urban and rural areas), hence it is replying to this Inquiry as it is very relevant
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNCC identifies demand for transport to isolated communities by evaluating demand for services that already exist  
defaultc)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe extent to which the needs of different groups of passengers can be taken into account is constrained by available budget
defaultd)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe challenges a
defaultssociated with providing better public transport to isolated communities are varied, but the only way they can be overcome is through more, and more consistent, long-term revenue funding 
defaulte)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCommunity Transport has a valuable role in meeting the public transp
defaultort needs of isolated communities but has constraints. It can be improved by better funding
defaultf)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe extent to which isolated communities should be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive services should be determined by communities themselves 
defaultg)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe main challenge to the public transport needs of isolated communities is the need for long-term, consistent revenue funding.

defaultNorthumberland is a large County, comprising both r
defaultural and urban communities.  
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is home to 312,000 people and covers 5013 sq km, of which 96.7% is classified as rural.   49% of the population live in rural areas
defaultc)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe South East Area is thus much more urbanised and densely populated, has more households with no car and therefore generates more bus use.  Social deprivation is greater than in the other two Areas.    
defaulte)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs the Table also shows, the North and West Areas a
defaultre much more rural.  They contain communities that are as remote as any in England, and car ownership is higher (and bus use lower) than in the South East Area.  Overall, the North and West Areas are more prosperous but this conceals the many pockets of de
defaultprivation and exclusion made worse by their distance from essential services and facilities thus increasing many daily living costs.
defaultf)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAbout 80% of bus services in Northumberland are commercial, i.e. not subsidised.  These run mainly in the South East Area. 
default In the West and North Areas, services are much sparser and, apart from some trunk routes, are largely subsidised by Northumberland County Council.

defaultNorthumberland County Council (NCC) is responding to this Inquiry as it wishes to contribute to the debate o

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNCC’s experience is that factors causing isolation differ between urban and rural communities as follows:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaulta)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNCC 
defaultidentifies demand for passenger transport in isolated communities mainly in a reactive manner by analysing the demand for those services which already exist, be they commercial or subsidised.  Where commercial services are scheduled for withdrawal or curta
defaultilment, or where subsidised services have to be reviewed due to budget constraints or retendering, NCC bases its decisions on the basis of value for money for the subsidy required (see answer to Q5 below).  We do not proactively attempt to identify demand 
defaultfor new services which do not already exist, or set criteria for service levels based on, for example, car ownership or population, because we do not have the resources to introduce new services in this way.
default&#xa0;
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNCC cannot comment on how Central Government 
defaultidentifies demand for passenger transport in isolated communities.  This responsibility appears to be left to bus operators and Local Transport Authorities (LTAs)
defaulta)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultClearly, commercial bus operators base their decisions solely on commercial criteria i.e. whether a bus service is profitable, rather
default than the needs of passengers
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLike most LTAs, NCC’s ability to take into account the needs of different groups of passengers is severely limited by budget considerations.  That part of our public transport budget that goes towards funding subsidised servic
defaultes in urban areas does not allow for provision greater than that based on the “400metre walking distance” rule-of-thumb described earlier.  
defaultc)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn order to provide services that offer value for money, “need” has to be expressed in terms of sufficient passenge
defaultr usage to justify expenditure.  Many communities express views along the lines of “this village needs a bus service” or “young people need a bus to take them into town in the evening” but without evidence of demand services cannot be provided.
defaultd)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNCC does, h
defaultowever, recognise the additional cost of running services to rural communities by having different value for money criteria for subsidising bus services as follows, on the basis that rural services will be longer than urban ones
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNCC wishes to answer the first part of this question separately for isolated 
defaulturban
default communities and for isolated 
defaultrural
default communities and then to answer the second part of the question for all communities.

default&#xa0;
defaultd)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThese challenges can only be effectively overcome by allocating significant additional amounts of revenue subsidy to services.  No bus operator can be expected to run unprofitable services, while LTA budgets are already tightly s
defaultqueezed.  Recent changes to BSOG have further damaged the cost/income ratio of many bus services.  Past initiatives such as Rural and Urban Bus Challenge consisted only of short-term funding.  While NCC appreciates the pressure on Central Government financ
defaultes, it feels constrained to point out that if services to isolated communities are to be improved, there is a cost attached.

defaultCommunity Transport (CT) plays a valuable role in providing transport to isolated communities (rural and urban) through
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, these advantage
defaults should not be overstated.  Some costs such as fuel are no lower than for the commercial sector and CT schemes, by their very nature, are small-scale locally based organisations who may not have the capacity to take on high-frequency intensive bus service
defaults    
defaultc)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe question of how can Community Transport be improved should be seen in the context of the fact that CT should be regarded as a means to an end (better passenger transport) not an end in itself.  All providers of passenger transport can be helped t
defaulto provide improved services by consistent, secure long-term revenue funding.
defaulta)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis may be up to local communities to decide
default.  Experience in Northumberland and elsewhere is very mixed.  Some communities have welcomed demand-responsive services because of their flexibility and perceived better quality and customer care, especially if they are locally-based and have some element 
defaultof community ownership and involvement..  Other communities have rejected such services because they are perceived as “second best” or “charity”, with the need to pre-book, with 24 or 48 hours’ notice, being compared unfavourably with the “turn up and go” 
defaultelement of a fixed route, timetabled bus service which can be accessed spontaneously.  Operation of demand-responsive services under Section 19, so they are only open to registered members, restricts the customer base and highlights the impression of separ
defaultateness.  Officers who have been involved with demand-responsive transport have also come across public perceptions that they are only for “old” or “disabled” people, particularly if the operators are associated with particular groups of people.  
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNCC is a
defaultlso concerned that, unless properly resourced, demand responsive services may not always be able to meet all requests.  It is aware of cases in the County and elsewhere, of demand responsive services that cover a large area where requests for service at si
defaultmilar times, but from different parts of the operating area, cannot be met simply because the vehicle cannot be in two places at once, even though there are spare seats on the vehicle.  The resources needed to provide sufficient capacity to meet such event
defaultualities may be such that it is no more expensive to provide a traditional, scheduled fixed route service.
defaulta)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultmain (indeed the only) challenge is that services to isolated communities have higher costs and lower income than those to communities that are easier to reach, and therefore need funding to close the gap between the two.
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIf isolated communities are to be 
defaultoffered better access to the services and facilities they want and need, i.e. their isolation is to be overcome, then this will require significant amounts of consistent, long-term revenue support.  As has been stated previously in this letter, short-term 
defaultfunding opportunities with heavy emphasis on capital such as the former Rural and Urban Bus Challenge created many new, innovative schemes which often generated sufficient usage for the communities concerned to want them to continue, but did not generate s
defaultufficient income to cover long-term running costs.  Councils then had to decide whether to use scarce funds to pay for their continuation or allow then to disappear.  
defaultc)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSome form of revenue-based, long-term financial support would seem to be the solution.  
defaultPerhaps there could be some form of “Isolated Communities Transport Fund” offering, through a bidding process, revenue funding for, say, five years for schemes that demonstrated effective tackling of rural or urban isolation?    
defaultd)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNCC welcomes the publicati
defaulton of the report “Valuing the social impacts of public transport”, published in March 2013 by the Department for Transport.  Space constraints preclude a detailed analysis of this very valuable report, but its publication shortly before the current Inquiry
default is certainly timely.  However, its appearance begs the question that if Government is prepared to commission research that shows the social benefits of public transport
default2
default and in particular the value of public transport to excluded groups
default3 
defaultand the fact that
default those isolated from public transport cannot enjoy its benefits
default3
default then it should be prepared to back this up with funding that tackles these issues and delivers the resultant benefits shown by the report
