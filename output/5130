defaultDefra welcomes the opportunity to submit evidence to E
defaultfra
default on the keeping of primates as pets.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default              
defaultPrimates are among the most intelligent animals; they are 
defaultsocially 
defaultcomplex
default, long lived and
default require specialist keeping
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default              
defaultIt is understandable, therefore, that people should be concerned when they hear of primat
defaultes being kept in inappropriate conditions that contravene the Animal Welfare Act 2006.
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default              
defaultDefra’s
default responsibility is to ensure that animals are provided with the appropriate protection and that enforcers have the necessary powers to take action in order t
defaulto investigate allegations of cruelty or poor welfare.  Defra also sees its role as reminding 
defaultowners and 
defaultpotential owners of their responsibility to provide for the welfare needs of their animals, as required under the 
defaultA
defaultnimal Welfare Act 2006. 
default&#xa0;
default1.5
default              
defaultDefra w
defaultould like to make it clear that primates should not be kept as pets in the 
defaultconventional 
defaultmeaning of the word “pet”.  If keeping a primate as a pet means keeping it in the domestic setting
default,
default whether in a cage or running free, 
defaultthen this would be likely to be
default 
defaulti
defaultn breach of 
defaultsection 9 of 
defaultthe Animal Welfare Act 2006
default (the need to provide an animal with its welfare needs)
default.  However, keeping primates in a 
defaultsuitable social 
defaultgroup setting in suitably constructed accommodation and ensuring that 
defaultall of 
defaultthe welfare needs of the animals are met 
defaultsh
defaultould 
defaultcomply with the Animal Welfare Act requirements 
default- as long as all other related regulations are being met.
default&#xa0;
default2.1
default              
defaultPeriodically the Government receives correspondence from interested stakeholders or ind
defaultividual members of the public, usually in response to campaigns from stakeholders, expressing their concern about the conditions in which some primates are being kept by individual owners.  Anecdotal evidence of solitary primates being kept in small cages 
defaultin a domestic setting and being fed inappropriate diets are central to most of the concerns.  Other concerns relate to the ease with which primates are advertised for sale on the internet.  Many adverts use terminology such as “good with children”, “diaper
default trained” and “will provide good company”.  Such claims are disturbing because
default we do not consider that
default primates should be kept in a domestic setting.
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default              
defaultThere are also allegations that many primates are being kept in breach of other legislation (e.g. the
default Convention on the 
defaultInternational 
defaultTrade in Endangered Species (CITES) as well as the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976
default - 
defaultsee “Legislative framework”
default.
default 
default Under the 1976 Act
default,
default anyone wishing to keep a listed animal must obtain a valid licence from their local auth
defaultority.  There are claims that listed animals are being kept without an appropriate licence.
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default              
defaultOther allegations claim that primates are taken from their natural habitat in the wild and transported to developed countries such as the UK and the US to be k
defaultept as pets.  Such action is likely to be in breach of laws in other countries as well as CITES and regulations on the welfare of animals in transport. However, there is little evidence to show that wild-caught primates are being transported to this countr
defaulty for the pet trade.  It is more likely that UK residents will obtain a captive bred primate than one that is wild caught and then transported to this country.
default&#xa0;
defaultAnimal Welfare Act 2006
default3.1
default              
defaultFor years, the Protection of Animals Act 1911
default was the principal piece of legislation that protected animals from acts of cruelty.  Under this law, it was an offence to cause any unnecessary suffering to an animal.  This stood the test of time and was used by agencies, such as the RSPCA to prosecute a
defaultround 800-1,000 people for animal cruelty each year.
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default              
defaultHowever, in 2007 the Animal Welfare Act 2006 (the “2006 Act”) came into force.  This largely replaced the 1911 Act and as well as retaining the “causing unnecessary suffering offence”
default,
default also introduc
defaulted the “welfare offence” under which an owner or keeper could be prosecuted for failing to provide for the welfare needs of 
defaultan 
defaultanimal.  The welfare offence was based on a similar offence that related to farm animals.  The new offence meant that for the fir
defaultst time owners of non-farm animals could be prosecuted for failing to look after their animals properly, even if no suffering had actually occurred.  This ha
defaults
default the benefit of not having to wait for an animal to undergo suffering before action c
defaultan
default be taken.  
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultUnder the 2006 Act, the maximum penalty for causing unnecessary suffering to an animal is 6 months imprisonment or a fine of £20,000, or both.
default 
defaultThe maximum penalty for failing to provide for the welfare needs of an animal is 6 months impri

defaultPrimate 
defaultCode of Practice
default3.5
default              
defaultIn addition, under the 2006 Act
default there are powers for the Secretary of State to make statutory codes of practice for
default the welfare of animals or animal related activities.  In 2010, Defra introduced the 
defaultCode of Practice for the Welfare of Privately Kept Non-human Primates
default.  The code was made in response to 
defaultconcerns about primates expressed during the passage of the Animal
default Welfare Bill through Parliament.  
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default              
defaultWhilst it is not a

default&#xa0;
default3.7
default              
defaultThis Code of Practice is a guide to the steps a 
defaultprivate 
defaultkeeper of primates must take to meet the needs of an animal as required by Section 9 of the 
default2006
default Act.  
defaultIt also provides local authority or RSPCA 
defaultinspectors, who may be investigating an allegation of a primate being kept in poor welfare conditions, with guidance on how 
defaultthe primate should be being kept.
default It does not apply to zoos or research establishments (where other guidance is available). 
default&#xa0;
default3.8
default              
defaultTh
defaulte Code of Practice is due to be reviewed in 2015 (five years after it was made).  We will be inviting key stakeholders and experts to take part in the review.
default&#xa0;
defaultPet Animals Act 1951
default3.9
default              
defaultThe 1951 Act requires anyone who is in the business of selling animals 
defaultas pets to obtain a valid licence from their local authority.  The local authority has powers to inspect premises and decide whether to issue a licence based on whether the animals will be held in appropriate conditions.  The local authority can issue a li
defaultcence with conditions such as limiting the species of animals the pet shop may sell.
default  The local authority has powers to investigate allegations of cruelty or poor welfare in a pet shop.  The local authority also ha
defaults
default powers to charge a fee to an applicant t
defaulto cover the cost of administering the licensing scheme.

defaultAnyone who is in the business of selling animals as pets and does not hold a valid licence

defaultDangerous Wild Animals Act 1976
default3.11
default              
defaultCertain species of primate deemed sufficiently dangerous are contained in a Schedule to the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976 (
defaultthe “1976 Act”
default) and are subject to a licensing regime administered and enforce
defaultd by local authorities. 
default&#xa0;
default3.12
default              
defaultThe precise 
defaultprimate 
defaultspecies listed in the Schedule to the 1976 Act and thereby requiring a licence to keep them are:
default&#xa0;
defaultNew-world monkeys (including: capuchin, howler, 
defaultsaki
default, 
defaultuacari
default, spider and woolly monkeys - night monkeys (also known as owl monkeys) 
defaulttiti
default monkeys and squirrel monkeys are excepted); 
defaultOld-world monkeys (including: baboons, the drill, 
defaultcolobus
default monkeys, the gel
defaultada, guenons, 
defaultlangurs
default, leaf monkeys, macaques, the mandrill, 
defaultmangabeys
default, the 
defaultpatas
default and proboscis monkeys and the 
defaulttalapoin
default); 
defaultAnthropoid apes (chimpanzees, gorillas, 
defaultbonobos
default, and orang-utans);
defaultGibbons and 
defaultSiamangs
default;
defaultLeaping lemurs (including: the indri, and 
defaults
defaultifakas
default - the woolly lemur is excepted); 
defaultLarge lemurs (bamboo or gentle lemurs are excepted).
default&#xa0;
default3.13
default              
defaultThe schedule of listed species was last amended in 2007. The amendments were made in order to reflect species 
defaultbetter 
defaultthat are considered as genuinely danger
defaultous to people – there were criticisms that the previous list was not consistent in this respect.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.14
default              
defaultSome 
defaultstakeholders 
defaultwould like to see certain species of primates re-instated on the schedule in order to provide more protection for primates.
default&#xa0;
default However, 
defaultit is important to remember that the 1976 Act is 
defaultprincipally 
defaultabout protecting people from animals rather than providing additional welfare protection to animals.
default&#xa0;
default Therefore the schedule should reflect animals that are considered a genuine threat to the pub
defaultlic.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultSimply to 
defaultplace more species on the schedule as a way of providing an additional regulatory requirement for owners, or potential owners, of primates would 
defaultpotentially 
defaultgo beyond the scope and purpose of the 1976 Act
default and legal advice has confirmed that
default, if species were listed for reasons other than their dangerousness, then there would be a high risk of legal challenge being successful.
default&#xa0;
default3.15
default              
defaultT
defaulthere is no central depository, held either by Defra or DCLG, for information relating to the number of licences
default issued or which species they cover.
default  These are kept within each local authority.
default&#xa0;
default3.16
default              
defaultThe 
default1976 Act
default provides 
defaultsome
default ancillary welfare provisions as a local authority cannot grant a licence unless it is satisfied that the specimens “kept…. under the authorit
defaulty of the licence”: 
default“
defaultbe held in accommodation which secures that the animal will not escape, which is suitable as regards construction, size, temperature, lighting, ventilation, drainage and cleanliness and which is suitable for the number of animals 
defaultproposed to be held in the accommodation, and
default 
defaultbe supplied with adequate and suitable food, drink and bedding material and be visited at suitable intervals
default.”
default&#xa0;
default3.17
default              
defaultThe 
default1976 Act 
defaultis a regulatory piece of legislation rather than a prohibitive one and does not 
defaultdeny the right for people to keep those animals listed on the Schedule as long as an appropriate licence has been obtained.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)
default3.18
default              
defaultAll primates are listed on CITES of which the UK is a signa
defaulttory.
default&#xa0;
defaultThrough CITES, the UK works with 178 other countries to protect endangered species of 
defaultanimals 
defaultand 
defaultplants 
defaultby restricting and monitoring international trade in them.  The objective of CITES is not to prohibit all trade in animals and plants, but to ensure that it is carried out in a sustainable way that ensures the long-term survival of all species. 
default CITES proh
defaultibits the commercial importation of the most endangered
default 
defaultAppendix I wild-taken primates in all but exceptional circumstances, such as for breeding or educational purposes which benefit the conservation of the species.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultT
defaultrade in captive-bred specimens is gen
defaulterally considered to be sustainable and so is allowed, subject to certain licensing provisions.
default 
default 
defaultAll imports of primates from outside the EU are subject to strict controls.
default&#xa0;
default3.19
default              
defaultRecords of primates being imported as pets into the UK from outside the EU (n
defaulto CITES records are kept of intra-EU trade) are rare. They 
defaultshow that in the past 5 years (December 2008 – December 2013) only 4 
defaultlive primates have been reported as imported 
defaultfor personal purposes
default 
defaultinto the UK; of these, two were imported by an animal sanctua
defaultry.  
default&#xa0;
default3.20
default              
defaultAlthough CITES is not a welfare Convention, the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations that implement CITES in the EU place a condition on imports of all live Annex A and B species (the EU equivalents of Appendices I and II) that the intended accommodat
defaultion must be adequate to care for the animals properly. This applies to all primates. Such import applications must be accompanied by a detailed description of the intended housing facilities so that the relevant CITES Scientific 
defaultAuthority (the Joint Nature
default Conservation Committee) can assess their adequacy as part of the application.
default&#xa0;
default4.1
default              
defaultDuring 2013, Defra officials asked a representative of private keepers to work with the Pet Advertising Advisory Group (PAAG - a group
default of animal welfare, keeping and veterinary organisations) to draw up guidance and pop-ups
default for internet advertisers (similar to work they have done with other pets).
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultPAAG have 
defaultnow 
defaultpublished advice to potential owners of primates which is available on 
defaulttheir website.  Once PAAG know who their affiliated websites will be (those who agree to adopt their minimum standards) those sites will place the pop-ups on their classified pages.   
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default              
defaultWe have been alerted by stakeholders 
defaultthat 
defaultsome 
defaultadvertisements for 
defaultprimates 
defaultmay be 
defaultbogus and an attempt to extract money from unwitting customers in exchange for an animal that doesn’t exist.  The advertisements are allegedly selling a primate in this country but the use of American-English terminology, such as “diaper-tr
defaultained” should arouse suspicion as “diaper” is not in common use in this country.
default&#xa0;
default5.1
default              
defaultIt is not clear how many primates are kept privately in this country – the estimates range from 2,500 to 7,500. 
defaultThese are rough estimates base
defaultd around numbers of 1976 
defaultAct 
defaultlicences issued in relation to primates and sales of primates. 
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default              
defaultThe number of pet primates rescued by Monkey World (one of two primate sanctuaries in England) has, according to their records, increased in the last two year
defaults from an average of 0.4 per year from 1989 to 2011, to 15 in 2012 and 11 in 2013.  
defaultWhilst this shows a steep increase it is low
default in absolute terms
default and would be too early to say whether 
defaultsuch figures
default signal a steady rise in primate ownership or a steady rise
default in people alerting the authorities about welfare concerns of primates.
default  We would also need more evidence on which to base any estimates about the numbers of privately held primates.
default&#xa0;
default6.1
default              
defaultSome people have called for 
defaultadditional regulations to help secure the welfare of primates.
default&#xa0;
default6.2
default              
defaultAnimals in zoos are protected not only 
defaultby 
defaultthe Animal Welfare Act 2006 but also 
defaultby 
defaultthe Zoo Licensing Act 1981.  The 1981 Act 
defaultdefines a zoo as an establishment where wild animals (those not 
defaultnormally domesticated in the UK) are kept for exhibition to the public for seven days or more a year.   The Act 
defaultrequires all zoos to have a licence
default, although exemptions from some or all of the provisions of the Act can be allowed for small zoos in specific
default circumstances
default. 
default Zoos are subject to inspection and licensing by their local authority.  
default&#xa0;
default6.3
default              
defaultThere have been calls for individual primate owners to be subject to the same requirements as 
defaultzoos.  Under the 1981 Act, the Secretary of State has published Standards of Modern Zoo Practice with which all zoos are expected to 
defaultcomply 
defaultif they wish to be granted and subsequently retain 
defaulta 
defaultzoo
default licence.   However, the standards go further than requiring
default minimum welfare standards
default for
default the animals.  They also set out how
default zoos should meet the 
defaultconservation 
defaultand education 
defaultrequirements 
defaultof the Act (arising from the EC Zoos Directive), and also how public safety should be secured
default.  Clearly for individual owners th
defaultese requirements will not be required – 
defaultalthough 
defaultfor primates listed in the Schedule to the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976 there is a need to prevent injury to people by the animals.  We would therefore not expect to apply 
defaultthe Secretary of State’s Standar
defaultds of Modern Zoo Practice to individual owners.  
defaultHowever, for purposes of animal welfare, w
defaulte consider that the standards set out in the Primate Code of Practice provide primates 
defaultowned by individuals 
defaultwith the same level of protection as those 
defaultkept 
defaultin zoos. 
default In both cases the Animal Welfare Act 2006 would 
defaultapply in the event of any 
defaultcases of cruelty or poor welfare.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default7.1
default              
defaultWhilst we agree that people should not be keeping primates in inappropriate conditions th
defaulte available evidence
default does not 
defaultsuggest that th
defaultis 
defaultis a
default 
defaultmajor
default problem.
default  
default&#xa0;
default7.2
default              
defaultWe do not consider that it would be appropriate to seek to ban the keeping of primates as pets because it is already illegal to keep primates in 
default“
defaultpet like conditions
default”,
default i.e. to keep primates in inapprop
defaultriate conditions is an offence under the Animal Welfare Act 2006.  To seek a specific ban on top of the existing law would be difficult to achieve because there would have to be a definition of “pet” or something that differentiates from keeping them in su
defaultitable conditions.  
defaultEven if a definition could be found it is difficult to see what this would achieve that is not currently available under the existing law.
default&#xa0;
default7.3
default              
defaultTo introduce a wider ban on the trade in primates or on all private keeping of primates woul
defaultd mean that 
defaultknowledgeable 
defaultpeople who keep them in appropriate conditions would be unable to continue to do so.  This would penalise law abiding, responsible owners because of the actions of irresponsible owners.  It would be disproportionate and, given the
default number of primates imported as pets (four in last five years), without any 
defaultreal 
defaultfoundation.
default&#xa0;
default7.4
default              
defaultThe Government considers that the existing legislation on the welfare of kept animals and the regulation of the pet trade provide enforcers with appropriate p
defaultowers to take action 
defaultin cases where a primate’s welfare is causing a concern.
default&#xa0;
default7.5
default              
defaultWe also consider that PAAG’s work will help to alert prospective owners of primates 
defaultto 
defaultthe welfare needs 
defaultof 
defaultprimates.  
default&#xa0;
default7.6
default              
defaultThe
default forthcoming
default review of the Primate code of pr
defaultactice will also help to assess whether further action needs to be taken.
