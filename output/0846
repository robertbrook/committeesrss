default&#xa0;
defaultExecutive Summary default&#xa0;
defaultWe welcome the Health Select Committee’s inquiry into the Management of Long-Term Conditions.
default defaultThe points we would like to raise are as follows:
default&#xa0;
default1.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAlthough significant improvements in the prevention and treatment of CVD over the last decade have been made, CVD remains one of the largest causes of
default death and disability in the UK
default.
default1.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Global Burden of Disease Study demonstrates
default 
defaultthat 
defaultUK
default could do better i
defaultn improving CVD mortality rates
default in comparison with other European countries
default.
default1.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is estimated that 
defaultthat there are approximately 2.5
default million people diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes 
defaultand
default up to 850,000 undiagnosed
default in the UK
default3
default.
default1.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe recent DUK State of the Nation report highlights that only 
defaulthalf of people with Type 2 diabetes get the annual tests and investigations that are recommended in the national standards. Importantly
default,
default even where testing is taking place
default,
default many patients are not achieving the recommended target range for risk factors
default.
default More must be done to address this
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA wide variation in the treat
defaultment and management of diabetes
default across England 
defaultremains
default.
default 
default2.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are geographical inequalities across the UK in CHD mortality and this is often worse in areas of highest deprivation
default. 
default2.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAnother example of a national health inequality exists in the diagnosis and management of Familial Hypercholesterolaemia (FH) 
defaultor ‘inherited high cholesterol’ across the devolved nations
default.
default2.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe recent NHS Information Centre on the ‘Use of NICE appraised medicines in the NHS in England -2010 and 2011, Experimental Statistics
default’
default showed that there was a variation in utilisation of medicines for long-term conditions. For example
default,
default 
defaultthe
default 
defaultratio of observed to expected usage of a NICE-approved 
defaultnon-statin 
defaultcholesterol management therapy in the London SHA was approximately 0.6 in 2010 and 0.55 in 2011 versus nearly 0.9 in 2010 and nearly 0.8 in 2011 in the South East Coast SHA
default.
default2.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAccess restrictions to NICE approved medicines remains a problem at local formulary level, which can lead to postcode prescribing which reinfo
defaultrces healthcare inequalities
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNHS spending on diabetes was almost £10 billion in 2011, which was 10 per cent of the NHS budget. 80 per cent of NHS spending on diabetes goes into managing avoidable complications. People with diabetes account for around 19 per cent of hospital inpatients at any one time, and have a three day longer stay on average than people without diabetes. Most of type 2 diabetes c
defaultosts are due to hospitalisation.
default3
default3.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMore effective risk factor management in the community has the potential to reduce costs to the NHS
default, while 
defaultimproving quality of care
default.
default3.2.1.
default 
defaultEvidence into Practi
defaultce (
defaultEiP
default) is a
default clinical change manag
defaultement programme
default. The 
defaultprogramme
default 
defaultaims to ensure that people with diabetes and those at increased cardio-metabolic risk receive 
defaultoptimal care
default through the effective implementation of national policy and guidelines, particularly NICE Type 2 Diabetes Guidelines
default. 
defaultAn example of the success of this approach was demonstrated in Greenwich. R
defaultesults after one year show
defaulted
default that in practices who took up the programme 
defaulta
default significant improve
defaultment in patients achieving NICE-recommended
default risk factor targets 
defaultwere
default achieved 
defaultand substantial 
defaultoverall cost-
defaultsavings
default 
defaultwere demonstrated 
defaultdue to 
defaulta reduction in hospital admission rates
default. NICE have endorsed EiP as a proven case study for QIPP. NICE concluded that the programme scored 100% for evidence of change and 75% fo
defaultr both savings made and quality.
default 
defaultThis approach e
defaultnabl
defaulted
default the delivery of higher standards of care at
default a lower overall cost to the NHS
default.
default3.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, current national QIPP
default standards 
defaultoften
default focus on short-term drug budget savings 
defaultthrough prescribing indicators 
defaultrather than
default encouraging
default optimising medicines in line with NICE quality standards, guidelines and recommendations.
default3.3.1.
default 
defaultFor example, although the NICE Type 2 Diabetes guideline (CG
default87
default)
default outlines a number of treatment pathways based on
default individual patient profile utilising older and newer therapies appropriately, the QIPP prescribing comparator for diabetes is 
defaultsolely 
defaultbased on the use of low cost drugs relative to newer therapies
default.
default3.3.2.
default 
defaultMedicine optimisation is about ensuring the right patients get the right choice of medicine at the right time and how patients comply. 
defaultNational measure of quality such as QIPP 
defaultprescribing comparators 
defaultand other outcome indicators 
defaultshould be focussed around NICE
default quality standards and guidance
default 
defaultrather than
default stand-alone
default 
defaultcomparators that may encourage 
defaultshort-term savings that 
defaultcould
default have unintended
default costly
default consequences.
default&#xa0;default4.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultInconsistencies exist in national guidance for treating patients and how GPs are incentivised
default,
default 
default4.1.1.
default 
defaultFor example, 
defaultIn 
defaultthe 
defaultNICE 
defaultType 2 Diabetes Guideline (
defaultCG
default 
default87)
default11
default 
defaultit
default states, “
defaultConsider intensifying cholesterol-lowering therapy (with a more effective statin or
default cholesterol absorption inhibitor) in line with NICE guidance
default if there is existing or newly diagnosed cardiovascular disease, or if there is an increased albumin excretion rate, to achieve a total cholesterol level below 4.0 mmol/litre (and HDL cholesterol not exceeding 1.4 mmol/litre) or an LDL cholesterol level below 2.0 mmol/litre.”
default4.1.2.
default 
defaultHowever, the Quality Outcomes Framework 
defaultthat incentivises
default GP states: The percentage of patients with diabetes, on the register, whose last measured total cholesterol (measured within the preceding 12 months) is 5 mmol/l or less and has an activity threshold of 40-75%
default.
default4.1.3.
default 
defaultThe European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society Guidelines are even more stringent than
default UK 
defaultNICE 
defaultguidelines 
defaultfor very high risk patients
default,
default 
defaultthey recommend 
defaultan LDL-C goal of 1.8 mmol/litre and/or 50% reduction when target level cannot be reached
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe impact 
defaultof factors 
defaulton quality of life &amp; productivity 
default(such as 
defaultthe 
defaultpotential 
defaultimpact of 
defaulthypoglycaemia in Type 2 diabetes) 
defaultshould 
defaultbe 
defaultrecognised
default, researched
default and acknowledged within NHS measures 
defaultof long-term condition management 
defaultquality 
defaultthroughout the system
default. 
default4.2.1.
default 
defaultFor example, 
defaultDVLA guidelines
default 
defaultstate 
defaultfor people with 
defaultdiabetes
default 
defaultwhen treated with medication other than insulin which carries a risk of inducing hypoglycaemia (including sulphonylureas and gl
defaultinides), the following standard

defaultapplies in order to retain a driving 
defaultlicenc
defaulte:
default&#xa0;
defaultClass 2 Drivers (buses and lorries)default&#xa0;
defaultClass 1 Drivers (cars and motorcycles)default&#xa0;
defaultThe impact of hypoglycaemia on a person who is a professional driver or who drives regularly could be very significant on both quality of life and productivity
default if 
defaulthypoglycaemia leads to losing
default their licenc
defaulte
default.
defaultSimilarly, 
defaulti
defaultn the elderly
default e
defaultven a mild episode of hypoglycaemia may lead to adverse outcomes in frail elderly patients. For example, episodes of dizziness or weakness increase the risk of falls and fracture
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultNICE Quality Standard for Diabetes
default recognises the importance of hypoglycaemia and includes a measure that states:
default 
default‘People with diabetes who have experienced hypoglycaemia requiring medical attention are referred to a specialist diabetes team’
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQuality measures recognising factors such as h
defaultypoglycaemia monitoring 
defaultand/
defaultor management
default, 
defaultshould 
defaultalso 
defaultbe
default incentiv
defaultised in QOF and
default CCG Outcome Indicators
default.
default              default5.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA
defaultlthough testing, such as the 9 Key Care Processes for Diabetes
default, are important
default testing alone cannot make a difference to outcome, healthcare professionals need to ensure action is taken on the results of tests to ensure that people’s 
defaultlong-term condition
default and risk-factors are being managed effectively
default3
default. Quality measures and outcome indicators throughout the NHS system 
default(e.g. CCG outcome indicators) 
defaultshould reflect this.
default5.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFor example in diabetes,
default even where testing is taking place, many patients are not achieving the recommended target range for risk factors (e.g. although 90% of Type 2 Diabetes patients are having their HbA1c and cholesterol tested, only 60% are achieving target HbA1c levels and only 40% are achieving their target cholesterol level in England)
default3
default.
default5.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAccess to education of the patient
default 
defaultand care planning 
defaultis of paramount importance
default3
default.
default 
defaultA patient should be informed and enabled to take a role in self-management of diabetes risk-factors and understand factors such as the importance of optimal blood glucose control in order
default to avoid serious complications.
default&#xa0;default6.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWith the dissolution of NHS Diabetes, there is a gap in support &amp; education for development of commissioning for diabetes services at the very time when it is most needed. 
default6.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere 
defaultare
default a wide number of data sets available for CVD and diabetes but they are often difficult to interpret and support is required on how to utilise these and help in practical implementation of commissioning
default.
default&#xa0;
default7.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFirst Diabetes (Derbyshire) is a current of example of how integrated care can provide real improvements in care for diabetic patients, whist reducing admission rates
default.
default 
default7.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSee 
defaultearlier example of EiP
default9
default example, paragraph 
default3.2.1
default.
default&#xa0;
default8.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDiabetes cost approximately £ 23.7bn in the UK in 2010/2011: £ 9.8bn in direct costs (£1bn for Type 1 diabetes and £ 8.8bn for Type 2 diabetes) and £ 13.9bn in indirect costs (£ 0.9bn and £ 13bn). In real terms, the 2035/2036 cost is estimated at £ 39.8bn: £ 16.9bn in direct costs (£ 1.8bn for Type 1 diabetes and £ 15.1bn for Type 2 diabetes) and £ 22.9bn in indirect costs (£ 2.4bn and £ 20.5bn
default)
default. 
default8.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is key that 
defaultthere is 
defaulta shift in focus 
defaultfrom short-term cost-cutting in the community-setting 
defaultto more efficient use of NHS resources
default,
default 
defaultby effective
default prevention,

default.
default This should be supported by appropriate measu
