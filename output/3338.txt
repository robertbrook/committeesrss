[[[Clause 51 versus the LRO procedure]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Committee were interested in the relationship between the new order-making procedure to disapply legislation which is no longer of practical use (clause 51) and the existing Legislative Reform Order (LRO) procedure in the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 (the 2006 Act).  This paper addresses the Committee’s query in three parts:

[[[&#xa0;]]]Could the LRO procedure be used to deal with legislation which is no longer of practical use?&#xa0;2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The LRO procedure and the proposed new order-making power have different aims.&#xa0;3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The LRO procedure is aimed at removing or reducing “any burden, or the overall burdens, resulting directly or indirectly for any person from any legislation”.  “Burden” is defined in section 1(3) of the 2006 Act as meaning:&#xa0;4)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; By contrast, the new order-making power is aimed at legislation which does not impose any burdens (or bring any benefits) because it does not have any practical effects at all.  The reasons for using the order-making power to repeal legislation are that the legislation in question was passed for a limited purpose which has been achieved, that the legislation has been superseded by other legislation or that the legislation regulates an activity which, as a result of social or economic development, no longer takes place. &#xa0;5)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The point of introducing the new order-making power is not to reduce burdens but to avoid the confusion which can all too easily be caused by the presence on the statute book of legislation which is no longer of practical use.  For example, users of legislation could reasonably assume that law still on the statute book must have some remaining purpose – and may spend time fruitlessly trying to identify that purpose.&#xa0;6)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Government notes that the repeal of legislation which is no longer of practical use is, at present, dealt with mainly through the Law Commission’s SLR (Statute Law Repeals) work and not through LROs.  This is consistent with the Government’s understanding of what may be done through the use of LROs. However, the SLR process, excluding the Parliamentary stages, is lengthy and cumbersome. The new order-making power is faster and simpler.&#xa0;7)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Finally, the Government notes that, although the Bill provides for a new order-making power, the chosen form of parliamentary scrutiny (set out in clause 56) is essentially the same as that set out in section 16 of the 2006 Act (one of three methods of scrutiny available under that Act).  The Government has used an existing model for scrutiny rather than creating a new one, which is consistent with a recommendation made by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in its 3rd Report of the 2012-2013 session (Special Report: Statutory Procedures for the Scrutiny of Delegated Powers).&#xa0;Could the LRO procedure be amended to allow for the repeal of legislation which is no longer of practical use?&#xa0;8)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It would be technically possible to amend the existing LRO procedure to allow for the repeal of legislation which is no longer of practical use but this would require a number of amendments to the 2006 Act. The result would be less clear and simple than the creation of a new and separate order-making power. &#xa0;9)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; For example, complex amendments would be required to deal with effects of orders in Scotland because the LRO mechanism cannot be used to deal with matters devolved to Scotland (section 9 of the 2006 Act), and it often makes sense for legislation that is no longer of practical use to be repealed on a UK wide basis, even if it deals with devolved matters.&#xa0;10)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In addition, the safeguards provided for under the 2006 Act reflect the current purposes of LROs, i.e. the removal or reduction of burdens.  Not all of them are proportionate or appropriate in the context of the repeal of legislation which is no longer of practical use.

[[[&#xa0;]]]Is it desirable to have the new order-making power sit within the 2006 Act?  &#xa0;11)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; An alternative to amending the existing LRO procedure would be to insert the substance of clauses 51 to 57 as a new part of the 2006 Act. If the committee prefers this solution, we would be happy to adjust the drafting of the Bill accordingly.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
