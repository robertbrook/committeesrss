"&#xa0;\nR3, the insolvency trade body – Written evidenceIntroduction&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nExecutive Summary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nKey areasClause 9 – partial licensing\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSchedule 5, part 6 – repeal of provision for authorisation of nominees and supervisors in relation to voluntary arrangements\n&#xa0;\nSchedule 5, part 6 – direct authorisation of Insolvency Practitioners by the Secretary of State\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSchedule 5, part 5 - Basic bank accounts for \nundischarged\n bankrupts\nAdditional insolvency provisions – Schedule 5Answers to specific questions&#xa0;\nR3 do not believe these changes could have been achieved using existing secondary legislative procedures.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;R3 do not consider that the move in Clause 9, to introduce a partial licensing regime for Insolvency Practitioners (IPs), is evidenced based. Indeed, we have seen no evidence that these changes will fulfil the Government’s aim to increase competition within the sector. \n&#xa0;\nR3 do not believe the proposed partial licences will be widely taken up by practitioners as an overwhelming majority of the profession practise in both corporate and personal insolvency and as such would not be suitable for a partial licence. \n&#xa0;\nIn addition, the Bill prevents partial licence holders from acting in relation to partnerships. Whilst some large firms may have a limited practising scope and only deal with insolvent companies, they will often act in relation to \npartnerships, which means\n they will not take up partial licensing exclusively\n as this would fetter their ability to act in the full range of cases they wish to cover. As such, it is reasonably likely that firms such as these will require their employees to have full authorisation, despite the firm’s focus on corporate insolvency.\n&#xa0;\nR3 also believes that the move to introduce a partial licensing regime has several risks, which have not been fully considered by Government. \n&#xa0;\nTo provide proper advice to individuals and corporate entities, R3 believes it is necessary to have knowledge of insolvency legislation in its entirety. Insolvency is already a narrow specialism and reducing it further could impact on the quality of advice provided to individuals or companies.\n&#xa0;\nIf the standard of qualification for IPs is reduced there could be a wider impact on the reputation of the industry as a whole. For the insolvency regime to work properly, creditors and the wider public must have confidence in the profession. The level of knowledge and extensive experience required to become a qualified IP plays a significant role in ensuring that the profession is held in high regard. \nR3 is also concerned that Clause 9 may have a disproportionate impact on R3’s members who work in smaller firms. The explanatory notes outline that the partial \nlicensing regime will ‘reduce the cost of training and ongoing regulation for Insolvency Practitioners who specialise’. However, given an estimated 75% of small firms undertake both corporate and personal insolvency procedures for commercial \nreasons,\n it is likely that very few small firms will be able to take advantage of these benefits, as it would reduce the scope of work they could undertake. \nWhilst we do not believe that partial licences will be taken up widely, it is more likely to be the very large firms who are able to adopt partial licences (as their business models are more likely to have a limited practising scope).  As such, there is a risk that partial licences will create an unlevel playing field across the industry, making it relatively more costly for smaller IPs to compete in an already difficult market.\nR3 do not believe that the suggested partial licensing regime is deregulatory. There is no evidence to suggest that this change will increase competition within the sector and instead it risks reducing the quality of advice available to individuals and companies and may have a disproportionate impact on R3’s members who work in small firms.  \n&#xa0;R3 fully supports the insolvency provisions contained within Schedule 5 of the draft Bill and believe they will reduce the regulatory burden on businesses and individuals. \n&#xa0;\nHowever, as discussed in our response, R3 has serious concerns about Clause 9, which \nproposes changes to the authorisation of Insolvency Practitioners. These changes are unlikely to increase competition within the sector and risk adding complexity to a licensing regime that currently works well. In addition, R3 believes that the proposed changes will have a disproportionate impact on smaller IPs and may reduce overall standards. The changes would therefore appear to make the current regime unnecessarily complex, with little tangible benefit. For the reasons outlined above, we would caution the Government against introducing these measures.\n              \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;The changes contained within Schedule 5 should generally benefit businesses. The proposals will make the conduct of insolvency processes more efficient, which in turn should see an improved return to creditors, many of whom are businesses.\n&#xa0;\nHowever, as mentioned above, the proposed changes to Clause 9 may have a disproportionate impact on smaller insolvency firms, many of whom are micro-businesses. The changes may also risk reducing the quality of advice given to struggling businesses.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;R3 is not aware of a cost-benefit analysis or wider impact assessment for the changes proposed in Clause 9 of the draft Bill, but as stated above, we do not believe the changes are deregulatory.\n&#xa0;Power to \ndisapply\n legislation\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Existing procedures, such as the Deregulation Bill, can be used to achieve the same effect as the proposed ‘power to \ndisapply\n legislation no longer of practical use’. However, deregulatory bills, such as these, are introduced infrequently and the process is fairly cumbersome. \n&#xa0;\nAs the proposed power will seemingly undermine Parliamentary authority, we view this issue as a matter for Parliament.\n&#xa0;R3 believes that the meaning of the phrase ‘no longer of practical use’ is fairly clear and suggests that the wording remains broad to ensure that the power can be utilised effectively.\n&#xa0;This power would effectively repeal legislation by executive \ndictat\n rather than parliamentary scrutiny, which risks undermining parliamentary authority.\n&#xa0;\nThe power also overcomes the need for public consultation. Insolvency encompasses a broad range of legislation and is often affected by changes, which at first glance appear to be unrelated. Understandably therefore, legislative changes which adversely impact on insolvency can sometimes be overlooked by legislators.   If the need for public consultation is removed there is a real risk that potentially detrimental changes may slip through \nunnoticed.\n It is therefore vital that the consultation procedure is robust.\n&#xa0;\nR3, the insolvency trade body\n              \n16 September 2013\nANNEX A: detailed comments on the insolvency provisions contained within Schedule 5 of the draft Bill\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nANNEX ASchedule 5, part 1 – Deeds of ArrangementThis section of the draft Bill repeals the Deeds of Arrangement Act 1914. R3 supports this change, which repeals legislation relating to an insolvency solution no longer used.\nIn 1986, the Insolvency Act introduced Individual Voluntary Arrangements (IVAs), as an alternative to bankruptcy.  IVAs have effectively replaced deeds of arrangements, making the Deeds of Arrangement Act 1914 obsolete.\nSchedule 5, part 2 – administrationThe appointment of administrators\nR3 supports the provision to enable a company or directors to appoint an administrator despite the presentation of a winding-up petition, if the petition was presented during an interim moratorium.\nAdministration is a key business rescue tool and this move, which aims to facilitate administration, is likely to bolster the rescue culture and save businesses and jobs.\nNotice of intention to appoint an administrator \nThe draft Bill removes the current requirement to give notice of intention to appoint an administrator to persons who are not themselves entitled to appoint an administrative receiver or administrator in certain circumstances.\nR3 fully supports this move as following alternative and wider judicial interpretation it re-establishes what appears to have been the original sensible, intention of the legislation of informing only those parties who have the power to appoint an administrator themselves of the directors’ intention to appoint.\nThe release of an administrator\nIn insolvency, it will often be the case that there are insufficient assets in the ‘pot’ to make a return to unsecured creditors and as such, the unsecured creditors will have no financial interest in the administration. \nDespite this, current legislation implies that when an administrator wishes to obtain his release as office-holder, a normal resolution of all of the creditors is required, in addition to a resolution of all of the secured creditors. This situation gives rise to unnecessary creditors’ meetings, arranged with the sole purpose of giving the administrator their release.\nThe proposed changes in Schedule 5, part 2, will clarify the situation and make clear that where unsecured creditors have no interest in the administration, by virtue of the fact they will not receive a dividend, they are not involved in the administrator’s release, which can instead be resolved by the secured creditors. This will avoid the need for unnecessary creditors’ meetings, thereby reducing the costs of the process.\n&#xa0;Schedule 5, part 3 – winding-up companiesPayment to the Bank of England\nR3 supports the proposal to remove the court’s power to order payment into the Bank of England of money due to a company.  This power is no longer necessary and dates back to the Companies Act 1862, when the insolvency profession was largely unregulated.\nThe release of the liquidator when a winding-up order is rescinded\nSchedule 5, part 3 inserts a new subsection, which provides that when a winding-up order is rescinded, the liquidator has his or her release with effect from the time the court may determine. \nR3 considers this to be a useful provision, which will allow the liquidator’s release to be addressed at the same time the court rescinds a winding-up order. This will avoid the need for the liquidator to make a subsequent, separate application to court.\nSchedule 5, part 4 – disqualification of unfit directorsR3 supports the move in Schedule 5, part 4 to enable the Secretary of State or official receiver to directly request information that they consider relevant to a person’s conduct as a director. Currently, the Secretary of State/official receiver may only request information from the office holder, which imposes an administrative burden on the IP. The proposed changes should reduce this burden and assist the Government with the disqualification of unfit directors.\nSchedule 5, part 5 – bankruptcyAppointment of an interim receiver\nThe proposed amendment to permit the court to appoint the official receiver or any Insolvency Practitioners as an interim receiver in all circumstances is to be welcomed.\nCurrently, only the official receiver can be appointed by the court to act as interim receiver. As both the official receiver and Insolvency Practitioners can act as trustees of a bankrupt’s estate, it stands to reason that both parties should be able to act as interim receivers.\nStatement of affairs in creditor petition cases \nR3 supports the move in Schedule 5, part 5 to remove the requirement for a bankrupt to submit a statement of affairs in creditor petition cases, unless requested to do so by the official receiver. This will ensure consistency across insolvency legislation and put creditor petition bankruptcy on the same footing as companies wound up by the court, where the directors only submit a statement of affairs if required to do so by the official receiver. \nIt is our understanding that in the majority of cases, bankrupt individuals do not submit a statement of affairs. Individuals are often unaware of their duty to provide this information, as they have already submitted a Personal Insolvency Questionnaire, which contains the same information. As the official receiver already has the relevant information, these changes should remove the unnecessary burden on bankrupt individuals to provide this information twice.\nSchedule 5, part 7 – preferential debts of companies and individualsR3 supports the repeal of one element of priority given to employees’ wages in certain insolvency proceedings, as the type of employee contract it relates to no longer exists.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1\n&#xa0;\n"
