[[[&#xa0;]]]I am writing this in my personal capacity as 1) a concerned father and 2) a Christian.I should like to thank the Committee for their consideration of this matter, and commend them for having the interests of our young people at heart. We pray that you will be strengthened to bring this matter into law, in the understanding that ‘evil communications corrupt’.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;
