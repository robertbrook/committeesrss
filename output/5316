defaultQ94 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default defaultGood morning, Minister and colleagues.  Thank you for agreeing to speak to the Committee today on the issue of student loans and the student loan book.  Before we start, can I ask you to introduce yourselves for voice transcription purposes?
default  defaultMatthew Hiltondefault: My name is Matthew Hilton, Director of Higher Education in the Department for Business.
defaultMr Willettsdefault: My name is David Willetts, Minister for Universities and Science.
defaultMichael Harrisondefault: I am Michael Harrison, Executive Director of the Shareholder Executive, which is part of the Department for Business.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ95 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I want to start with the historic mortgage sale.  As you know, it was estimated that
default,
default of the student loan book
default,
default £890
default million-
defaultworth of mortgage-style loans were sold.  Effectively, the Government got £160 million for those loans, even though they valued them at between £81 million and £128 million.  On the face of it, it would seem that the Government got a very good deal, if you look at it from one perspective.  If you look at it from the perspective that there was £890 million
default-
defaultworth, they did not get a very good deal.  Did you undervalue them, or did the buyer overvalue them?
defaultMr Willettsdefault: I think everybody came 
defaultaway 
defaultwith a good deal, and we certainly got value for money for the taxpayer.  That figure of over £800 million is a nominal value.  In reality, most of these mortgage loans were not in repayment, or people who had the debt were below the earnings threshold.  We were always very realistic that this last tranche of residuals were the least-well-performing mortgage loans and their actual commercial value would be significantly below their face value.
defaultAs for the price that we eventually got, I think it was very reasonable.  There are areas of commercial negotiation that by convention always remain confidential, but I think we got a very good price given that these were underperforming loans.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ96 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I think everybody accepts that at least a proportion of the £890 million would have had to be written off anyway.  The question is: what potential was there to recoup it from 
defaultany
default buyer of the student loan book?  How do you think they will realise the extra £32
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion to £79 million
default-
defaultworth of additional value and still make a profit?
defaultMr Willettsdefault: Another figure that we have not gone into in public is our internal estimate
default, and we haven’t 
defaultever accepted a particular figure.  The reason
default why
default this could be a benefit for everyone is that, with my ministerial responsibilities for the Student Loans Company, I am thinking, for example, of the problems we had in getting payments out to students in 2009, less than five years ago.  We want the Student Loans Company to focus on its core task, which is delivering a high-quality service to students when they apply for loans, and administering the big asset: ensuring repayment of the income-contingent loans.  It was never going to be a priority use of staff or resource for the Student Loans Company to chase the last remaining underperforming mortgage loans. However, for the companies that specialise in underperforming loans
default,
default already have an infrastructure in place
default and
default know how to handle them, they may be able to put in time, effort and expertise that the Student Loans Company does not possess and do a better job than the Student Loans Company could have done.  That was clearly the assessment of the range of people we had who tendered for the loan book.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ97 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default You have partly answered my next question, which is along the lines of: why could the Department not have realised those efficiencies?  What you are saying in effect is that these companies are better equipped to recoup the money than the Student Loans Company.  My concern is that you threw in the comment that their priority would be the income-contingent loan book, which is that much greater.  The problem I have with that is that, if they are not very good at recouping these historic loans, what evidence is there to believe that they will be any better with the income-contingent loans?
defaultMr Willettsdefault: That is a completely different structure.  In reality, the vast bulk of those loans will be repaid via HMRC and linked to income tax.  The old mortgage loans had a different structure and different repayment arrangements.  Most of them were no longer in repayment. Any person considering the focus of activities of the Student Loans Company would not have said it was a good use of public money or resource for this small and busy organisation to follow up the residual
default,
default potentially obtainable sums out of the £800
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion
default,
default in theory
default,
default of mortgage loans.
defaultYou are right, Chair, that the big tasks for the Student Loans Company are very simple.  
defaultThe f
defaultirst
default is
default 
defaulta 
defaulthigher quality student experience as they apply for loans, and that we are working on. We are about to launch a new and much more user-friendly online application process.  There are shocking figures for the number of applications for student loans that begin online and end up with a phone call because people get stuck.
defaultThe other priority is
default absolutely
default to ensure that the repayments from the income-contingent loans, which are far bigger in scale, are properly managed. Those are our priorities.  I do not think that any Minister in recent years has suggested that it is a priority of the Student Loans 
defaultCompany to chase up the ancient mortgage-based loans on a different model, but we think that someone else who specialises in that can do it better.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ98 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default The reply that you have not made, which I think is quite interesting, is the one that I might have expected.  Given that the Chancellor has predicated his 
defaultB
defaultudget assumptions on the sale of at least a tranche, or several tranches, of the income-continent loans, would not the responsibility for the collection of those then move on to another body?  You made no reference to that whatsoever.
defaultMr Willettsdefault: There will be a different structure.  Here, we are obviously being advised by Rothschild and Barclays Capital.  In advance, there are lots of operational decisions still being taken, but the repayment of the income-contingent loans is done via HMRC in most cases, and that arrangement will not be changed as and when the income-contingent loan book, or tranches from it, is sold.  There will be a kind of server facility, as it is called technically, which will be an interface between commercial owners of the loans, as and when they are sold, and the continuing system whereby graduates will be paying back, via HMRC in most cases, in an unchanged way.  The mortgage loans were completely different.  There was not any use of HMRC.  It is much more like conventional debt collection, and it therefore made sense to sell the remaining loans to people whose specialisation is conventional debt collection.
defaultChair:default I do not want to stray too much.  We are going to deal with some of these issues in a moment.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ99 default&#xa0; 
defaultRebecca Harris:default Are you saying that private companies are better at collecting student loans than the Student Loans Company?
defaultMr Willettsdefault: I am saying that the priority for the Student Loans Company was not this residual of the £800 million nominal value of mortgage loans, which had a very different structure from current student loans.  I 
defaultdo 
defaultthink there are advantages
default, and 
defaultMr Harrison of the Shareholder Executive may wish to add to this list.  For example, professional debt collectors are also dealing with debts from individuals arising in other circumstances, and this is not a core responsibility of the Student Loans Company.  I do not think it would have been a prudent use of public money for me to say to the Student Loans Company that co
defaultllecting this residual amount in
default the old mortgage loans was a priority.  
defaultMichael Harrisondefault: In addition to what David has mentioned, the specialist debt collectors have technology designed specifically for this collection area.  In order to up its systems to match that, the SLC would have had to invest a lot of money so, in conjunction with the sale decision, there was an investment decision as to whether the SLC should put more money into this area.  It is clear that the private sector, because of technology and its broad knowledge of borrowers across the whole of the 
defaultUK
default in certain circumstances, has access to information about other loans that they can apply in collecting these mortgage-style loans.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ100 default&#xa0; 
defaultRebecca Harris:default You may have answered, or partly answered, my next question, which is: should we not be doing more either to learn from these companies or improve our own performance in collection in this area?
defaultMr Willettsdefault: As I said, with the sale of the mortgage-style loans there will not be any more debts in this form on the Student Loans Company
default’s book
default.  The focus now is 
defaultabsolutely 
defaultto 
defaultensure that as the income-contingent loans mature
default,
default graduates 
defaultre
defaultpay that efficiently, and that includes a major investment in a new IT system, which is going ahead and will be in place in time for the repayment of the high-level loans that came in from 2012.
defaultMichael Harrisondefault: It is also quite common market practice for debt organisations to sell books of this nature to specialist providers. We are not doing anything particularly unusual in these circumstances.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ101 default&#xa0; 
defaultRebecca Harris:default I accept that. Are the payments made by graduates to pay off loans ring-fenced to pay for higher education, or do they simply contribute to the Treasury’s pot?
defaultMr Willettsdefault: The sale of student loans contributes to a reduction of public
default 
defaultsector net debt, and the fact that they help reduce public
default 
defaultsector net debt in turn makes it possible for us to proceed with the increase in student numbers.  It is money that accrues to the Treasury and the Government; it does not accrue directly to BIS.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ102 default&#xa0; 
defaultRebecca Harris:default The NUS directly links student loan payments to current education policy.  In your view, to clarify, would finance for higher education decrease if payments went down, or vice versa?
defaultMr Willettsdefault: The repayment
defaults
default of student loans go to the Treasury and they do not directly impact the BIS budget.  
defaultWhen
default it came to a big decision like the decision to increase student numbers, the fact that this sale reduced public
default 
defaultsector net debt certainly help
defaulted
default a lot, but it goes to the Treasury and is not part of the Department’s annual process of expenditure setting.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ103 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default I have a related question on the HE pot.  I am sure we will be talking 
defaultto 
defaultthe Secretary of State
default about it next week
default, but it will be helpful to get the view of the Minister for Universities on the student opportunity allocation.  I am sure the Minister will agree that it has been massively important in securing social mobility and is widely supported.  Can you assure the Committee that it will not be cut in the Department’s imminent grant letter to HEFCE?
defaultMr Willettsdefault: We have yet to finalise the grant letter.  I cannot share with the Committee the grant letter that has not yet been sent.  I agree with you on the importance of access to university.  I think all parties take great heart from the good news that the fears that the increase in fees, although students do not pay it up
default-
defaultfront, might put people from poorer backgrounds off university have not happened.  We had record applications last year.  The latest news I have from OFFA is record levels of university spend on access.  It is very important that we spend on access.  The specific financial decisions about where that money should go have not yet been finalised.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ104 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default defaultWould you agree with me that if it were to be cut it would have a very damaging impact on some of our most disadvantaged communities?
defaultMr Willettsdefault: We would not wish to do anything that damaged access to university.  We are very proud of what we have already achieved on access to university, and we certainly do not want to jeopardise that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ105 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default I want to probe the philosophy of student loans in terms of repayment.  Was it always the attitude of Government that, even if we get back some of the student loan, that is a better position than we were in before
default, and 
defaulttherefore, we are happy with the situation, even though many students might understand that and feel they do not have to repay?
defaultMr Willettsdefault: All three political parties, when faced with the challenge of how to finance higher education, have ended up with a model in which you do not expect students to pay up
default-
defaultfront; you expect graduates to repay, but in turn you need some mechanism so that graduates repay only when they can afford it.  That is why the income-contingent loans are such a big improvement on the mortgage loans we were talking about before.
defaultYou are right that there is a double objective here.  On the one hand, we wish to collect all the money that is owed and to do so efficiently, but equally if people end up with low incomes and, for whatever reason, they are out of the jobs market and are not earning any money, they do not have to pay it back.  It is very important that students going to university realise that this is not like credit card debt
default,
default which will hit them regardless of their circumstances.  Now, under our new system, it is only if their income is over £21,000 that they will start to repay.  You are absolutely right.  I will always try to make a virtue of this and say to people 
defaultat
default sixth-form college
default,
default or whatever, “Don’t worry.  If for whatever reason your income is low, it is not like a mortgage or credit card; you will not have to repay.” That is a deliberate and progressive part of the system.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ106 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default So the 60% of people who 
defaultdon’t 
defaultgo to university have a tougher deal than university students in terms of loan repayment.  Is that the philosophy?
defaultMr Willettsdefault: It is absolutely the philosophy.  This is not a commercial loan; it is a graduate repayment scheme under which graduates repay if they are earning a reasonable income.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ107 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default I have got the philosophy.  I now understand that it was never expected that the loans would be repaid by a lot of people, and that we would get a smaller amount back than we loaned.  Your sale figures reflect that, don’t they? 
default              
default              
default              
defaultLet me go on to overseas students and their conditions
default,
default in terms of philosophy.  How much work do you do beyond self-certification to prove that overseas students actually do fulfil the requirements to 
defaultclaim
default loans that you say they should?
defaultMr Willettsdefault: First of all, if I may say this, a very important point on the philosophy is that in almost any other candidate system for financing higher education, such as a graduate tax, we would have no mechanism for collecting back payments from students from the rest of the EU. We would simply be giving them a free education, so I regard the fact that we have a loan and “debt” that has to be repaid as one of the advantages of the current system.
defaultIt is very important that if graduates are living outside the 
defaultUK
default,
default they know this is not some kind of device to enable them to escape repayment. We have significantly toughened the system already in terms of getting bank details before graduates leave the country and getting national insurance numbers.  We are willing to pursue people through the courts.  We are always interested in ways in which we can do even more.  So far, the performance of EU borrowers has been that they are less likely to take out a loan than 
defaultUK
default citizens; they are more likely to repay as a lump sum when they leave the country, but we will pursue them energetically.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ108 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default We had the opportunity to question Mr Bahram Bekhradnia, Director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, whom I think you will know.  I was rather concerned that his view was that the British people should take a hit on this; there is very little we can do, and his final quote was, “I think it
default’
defaults inherent in the system.” You are telling me that you do not accept that.
defaultMr Willettsdefault: I 
defaultdon’t, and
default I have read his evidence.  
defaultBy the way, 
defaultI should make 
defaultit 
defaultclear to the Committee that I do not have another engagement which would require my leaving this Committee during the hearing, so I will be able to answer your questions. 
default[Laughter.]
default 
defaultThat is not my philosophy. My philosophy is that around the EU people participate in our system; they are entitled to a fee loan, not to maintenance support
default,
default unless they have been three years resident.  We should energetically collect that money.  
defaultActually, t
defaulthe larger sum, which does not come across in the media, is accounted for by British students who then go and live abroad.  In some ways, tracking them as they move around is another challenge, but we are absolutely up for it.  If any external organisation—this Committee or the NAO—has further suggestions about what more we should do, we would 
defaultlike to 
defaultlook at t
defaulthem
default.
defaultMr Binley:default I am glad to hear you believe that if you take out a loan you should have every intention of repaying it.  
defaultThe 60%
default of British people who do not go to university will applaud that, and I am grateful to you for telling me that that is the philosophy.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ109 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Can I add that your willingness to act upon the advice of the Committee is also much welcomed?

defaultCan I move on income-contingent loans?  The autumn statement claimed that the additional outlay of loans caused by the relaxation and removal of the student numbers gap will be “more than financed by proceeds from the sale of the
default…i
defaultncome-contingent student loan book”.  Looking at the Treasury figures, I see it is estimated that the cost of the abolition will go from £180 million in the financial year 2014-15 progressively to nearly £2
default&#xa0;
defaultbillion in 2018-19, and effectively that will be financed from the sale of the student loan book.  It has been averaged out at £2.3 billion a year from 2015
default-
default16.  That is a projection done by the Treasury, but it would appear that the decision has not been made.  Therefore, a Treasury decision of crucial significance is being predicated on something that has not been made; indeed, there have been issues around value for money, which would reasonably make us question whether it would be made.
defaultMr Willettsdefault: There is a policy decision that we propose to sell tranches of the student loan book, subject to—here
default,
default you are absolutely right—a further value-for-money assessment before the button is finally pushed. We put these figures into Government financing documents 
defaultfrom 
defaultlast summer and autumn because there is now a clear policy intent to do it.  This Committee would expect us to do this.  Before the button is finally pushed
default,
default we will have had professional advice from our financial advisers, and we will need to be comfortable that the individual sales will be value for money.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ110 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default If the valuers decide that it is not value for money, the Government’s policy on relaxing and removing caps on student numbers is totally screwed.
defaultMr Willettsdefault: I 
defaultdon’t 
defaultthink that is an expression you will find in our Government policy document.  We always try to make them more user-friendly, but we 
defaulthaven’t 
defaultgo
defaultne
default quite that far yet.  There is a clear intention to sell the tranches.  We believe we can do it, and we have commissioned our professional advisers, Rothschild and Barclays, to work on it.  That is the intention, but there is a final assessment before we actually push the button.  
defaultYes, w
defaulte have to 
defaultbe confident. I would be very surprised if it did not pass the value-for-money test, but it does need to, so there is that further hurdle.  
defaultMichael Harrisondefault: As part of the feasibility work for the income-contingent loan sale, we clearly looked at value for money.  We think there is potentially a value-for-money case that needs to be proved up during the preparatory phase
default we are now
default in.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ111 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I believe that the Permanent Secretary is the accounting officer who is ultimately responsible for this. Do you not feel that it puts a totally exceptional, perhaps unfair, pressure on the Permanent Secretary to say that something is value for money when instinctively he feels that basically
default,
default it is not?
defaultMr Willettsdefault: This is how it is done.  When we are planning to sell assets
default,
default we identify them in Government documents as assets we intend to sell, and that enters the fiscal arithmetic when there is a reasonable certainty that they will be sold.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ112 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default If I may stop you there, it is more than just fiscal arithmetic, because universities have to plan in advance.  If they have been given a green light, if you like, to pursue a certain policy, they 
defaulthave to start 
defaultimmediately in order to have everything in place to realise the potential of that policy.
defaultMr Willettsdefault: It is the Government’s settled policy that we should move in this direction and over time raise and then remove the cap on student numbers.  That is the plan, and that is what we expect universities to work around.
defaultMatthew Hiltondefault: To add two brief points to this discussion, the first is that the decision to proceed to sale would be taken only on the basis of a genuine value-for-money judgment. Your question about the accounting officer is quite right.  Secondly, as an important matter of general principle
default,
default from my perspective, as the person who is responsible for much of the management of the HE teams in the Department, there is no logical linkage between discussions we might have about the future 
defaultsale 
defaultor otherwise of loan books and the future of HE budgets.  It is convenient to talk about them together.  Very often the two of them are talked about in the same overall policy contexts, but we have assurances from the Treasury, which we can talk about, about the funding of expansion up to a certain point in the future.  That assurance is, logically speaking, separate from discussions about the sale of the loan book.  Therefore, as a matter of logic, although I acknowledge that in practice the two are talked about together, those two things are separate.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ113 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Can I get it clear?  You are saying that the Treasury has agreed to underwrite this policy irrespective of the sale of the student loan book.
defaultMatthew Hiltondefault: It would be fair to say that the Treasury do intend to underwrite this policy. If there is a shock to their expected budgets that changes some of the planning that they have in hand, we
default would
default have to sit down and talk to them, as would any Departmen
defaultt;
default but there is no logical flow through from a decision on the loan book to a decision on the expansion of HE budgets.
defaultChair:default 
defaultSo t
defaulthat could considerably alter Treasury expenditure projections.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ114 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Bain:default Your last point is one that I would like to take up.  When Dr
default&#xa0;
defaultMcGettigan appeared before the Committee to give evidence in December, he pointed to a very interesting development in the publications accompanying the autumn statement.  In table
default&#xa0;
default2.5 of the autumn statement, the second row refers to gross proceeds from the sale of the student loan book.  He explained in 
defaulthis 
defaultevidence what the Government would be getting up
default-
defaultfront from the proceeds of sale of this part of the loan book, but revenue is being forgone that transfers to the private sector.  His assessment is that £1.7 billion ought to be netted out of those figures from 2016 through to 2019, which would have a very important effect on the costing of the policy of expansion.  Can you explain what discussions you have had with the Treasury about why gross proceeds appeared in the autumn statement policy costings and not net proceeds of the sale?
defaultMr Willettsdefault: We did not commit the kind of schoolboy howler that Mr McGettigan claims.  I accept that different elements of the calculation are to be found in different autumn statement documents, and I would be very happy to send to the Committee in a single table the different lines of the calculation.  There is the extra loan expenditure as more students take out more loans; there are the gross proceeds from the sale of the loan book; and there is another line showing revisions to student loan repayments
default—
defaultthose falling as a result of some accruing to others, and for other reasons as well.  Incidentally, that is in table
default&#xa0;
default4.32 of the OBR economic and fiscal output report.  There are also grants for teaching and maintenance for the extra students, but they are all properly accounted for in the places they need to be accounted for.  I fully recognise this: it might help all of us in our deliberations if I put it together in a single table, which I will very happily send urgently to the Committee, referencing for each one the published source for the data.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ115 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default That is very welcome, and your description of it as a schoolboy howler is probably quite an accurate one.  I just make the comment that it seems odd to present the figures initially in such a way that it would leave them open to that sort of question.
defaultMr Willettsdefault: In the line for gross proceeds, they put in gross proceeds.  In the OBR fiscal arithmetic, which includes the revenues accruing to the Government from graduates repaying, there is a line that identifies reductions in graduate repayments for a range of factors
default:
default for example
default,
default changes in earnings forecasts, but also factoring in assumptions about some of the loan book having been sold.  All of that appeared as part of the autumn statement.  They are all in the right place but in different places, and I am absolutely willing to send them all in a single table.
defaultChair:default Collate them and send them to us those so we can make a judgment on them.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ116 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default Minister, as you well know I am a business
default 
defaultman, and it concerns me that on the recent sale you got 18% of the book value of the loan.  Would you put on a 
defaultbusiness 
defaultman’s hat and think you might squeeze a little more from people who may be getting 40% of the loan back into their coffers, making a very good profit on the deal?  I just wonder whether you have ever thought about phased payments, with a certain percentage for each loan above the amount of money you have sold it for, and whether your people could be sharper in terms of returning money to the taxpayer that was loaned by the taxpayer.
defaultMr Willettsdefault: The mortgage loan book will be a completely different type of sale, and we have expert advisers working on it.
defaultMichael Harrisondefault: In relation to the mortgage-style sale, that was exactly one of the issues we looked at.  The view was that the proportion of the loan book being repaid was very small; it was only 14%.  Therefore, the value we would get back, even on a profit share-type arrangement, would have been quite low.  The additional value we would get from having an up
default-
defaultfront payment where all the systems and knowledge were transferred to the new buyer would be greater.  That was part of our work.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ117 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default The return might be quite low, but would you not be reassuring the taxpayer that you are on the ball and looking to get more of their money back than they perhaps otherwise would get?
defaultMichael Harrisondefault: We have sought to get the money back via a competitive sale process.  Clearly, there was more than one bidder bidding for this asset, so we optimised value in that way rather than having an ongoing interest.
defaultMr Binley:default I would like you to think about it more, quite frankly.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ118 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default Minister, you mentioned earlier that the proceeds from ongoing book sales go back to HMRC.
defaultMr Willettsdefault: The Treasury.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ119 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default Through HMRC to the Treasury—quite right.  You mentioned
default that
default there is a need for IT investment.  How much is that IT investment, and who is paying for it?
defaultMr Willettsdefault: I might turn to Mr Hilton on this.  We are about to sign contracts for a very significant improvement in the IT system.
defaultMatthew Hiltondefault: The overall budget we have approved so far
default,
default talking about the Student Loans Company
default,
default is approaching £100 million.  As the Minister has said, that relates to a new core system that is fundamental to their transformation—that is the word the SLC uses—into a much more effective customer-facing and digitally-based organisation that fits in increasingly with the skill sets of its customer base.  That is a system that we hope to be in place early in 2015 so it will be up and running once we get into the repayment phase of the new post
default&#x2011;
defaultBrowne income-contingent loans.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ120 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default Does it come out of the Treasury because it makes life easier to collect the loans, or does it come out of your budget?
defaultMatthew Hiltondefault: It is part of the SLC budget, but this is a separately negotiated programme of money with relevant budgets approved through the normal process.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ121 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default Minister, you have assured students and graduates that their terms and conditions will not change, yet the student loan website states that the student must agree to repay the loan in line with the regulations that apply at the time, and the regulations may be replaced by later regulations.  Why have you put this clause in the contract?
defaultMr Willettsdefault: Successive Governments have made it clear when students take out loans that the terms could be changed by Government, but the fact of selling the loan book, or parts of 
defaultit, does not prompt any change in the terms.  If anything, it makes it very unlikely they would ever be changed, because at that point you have written a contract with the private purchaser on the basis of setting out the terms of the loan.  In terms of the conventional student loan package, though, successive Governments have always had the power to change the loans, if it is necessary.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ122 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default You specifically mentioned that only the Government can change the terms.  The buyers of the loan book cannot change the terms.
defaultMr Willettsdefault: Absolutely not.  They will be fixed at the point of sale.  I sometimes say to my friends in the NUS, who worry that there is a plot here to change the terms of the loans, that the best thing they should look for is the sale of any loans, because it is pretty likely that the contracts written at the time of the sale of the loans will specify the terms, but we will see how that shapes up.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ123 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default That is good to know.  Last month, the Higher Education Policy Institute drew our attention to a BIS spokesperson who said that new student loans get taken out all the time so there are always
default,
default in theory
default,
default newer loans that the Government could sell on.  Do you stand by that statement?
defaultMr Willettsdefault: Yes.  There are so many different issues around the sale of the loan book, but some of the comment implies that it is rather like shares in a privatised industry and we have only one block to sell. If
default—if—
defaultsubsequent decisions are taken
default—
defaultwe are 
defaultone Parliament 
defaultahead 
defaultof 
defaultthe pre
default&#x2011;
defaultBrowne book, and the student loan book is growing all the time, so a future Government 
defaultcould 
defaultdecide to continue to sell tranches of the student loan book.  It would have a decision to take about how much it wanted on its balance sheet, how much it wanted to sell and what was value for money.  We have not taken such a decision ourselves, but it is not a one-off asset that disappears after the sale.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ124 default&#xa0; 
defaultNadhim Zahawi:default From your answer, presumably you do not estimate that student debt will ever run out.
defaultMr Willettsdefault: There are various figures around, but, as long as one sticks with this model—all three political parties have ended up with it—new student loans will be created and there will be a new kind of asset on the Government’s balance sheet: loans due to be repaid.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ125 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default This approach was likened by one of the participants at our last hearing to a Ponzi scheme.  Could you outline the difference between this and a Ponzi scheme?
defaultMr Willettsdefault: All I know about Ponzi schemes is that they are completely disreputable and fraudulent, and the Government would not do that kind of thing where students and graduates are involved.
defaultChair:default You could say that, but I couldn’t possibly comment.
defaultMr Willettsdefault: It is perfectly reasonable for a Government to say that this 
default“
defaultasset
default”
default—sorry, I am talking financial language now—
defaultthis stock 
defaultof student loans
default, is growing, 
defaultand that you can reduce public
default 
defaultsector net debt by selling some of those loans.  This Government have a path for public
default 
defaultsector net debt, getting a grip on it and bringing it down.  Selling student loans is a perfectly legitimate way of doing that.  In a way, it brings 
defaulta kind of 
defaultcash-flow assistance.  It 
defaultmeans that, instead of a stream of future payments, you capitalise it and get help with cash flow early on.  Although
default,
default as Mr
default&#xa0;
defaultHilton said
default,
default there is not a direct connection, obviously if you can hold down public
default 
defaultsector net debt it makes it easier to have policies such as more students, and having more people with higher education qualifications is not just good for them; it is good for the economy in the long run.  
defaultThe value-for-
defaultmoney test is having a big enough economy to sustain it.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ126 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I do not think anybody here would dispute that.  The basis of this assumption
default i
defaults that for various reasons, which we will explore, the would-be purchasers of the student loan book may not be prepared to pay as much as they have in the past. Therefore, you would have an increasing financial commitment through the numbers of students taking out student loans, and a reducing amount that companies would be prepared to pay for that loan book.  In effect, you would
default therefore
default have diminishing returns and increasing obligations, and the whole thing would collapse.  I think that is the basis of it.
defaultMr Willettsdefault: It would not collapse.  It is a new form of financial instrument, and we will see what the market demand is, but for every tranche of sales there has to be a value-for-money test.  If there came a point when people said either that the market is saturated with these, or people do not want to buy them any more and so it is bad value for money, at that point the Government would not go ahead.
defaultMichael Harrisondefault: That is exactly right.  The newer issued loans have higher expected repayments, so if anything they have more value than the older loans.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ127 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I understand that is a perfectly possible situation.  If that is the case, it comes back to the need for the Treasury to adjust the assumptions on which it is making its future financial modelling.
defaultMr Willettsdefault: The Treasury is working on the basis that there is an agreed Government policy to sell the first tranches, subject to a value-for-money case.  The policy decision has been taken.  We can press an abort button and, if it is bad value for money, we will do so, but the settled policy, which we believe we can deliver, is to sell the tranches.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ128 default&#xa0; 
defaultKaty Clark:default Currently, graduates pay the lower bank base rate plus 1% or current RPI.  Your financial advisers
default,
default Rothschild
default,
default estimated that only £1 billion to £2
default&#xa0;
defaultbillion could be sold with this condition in place, but over £10 billion with it removed.  It has been suggested that you could sell the income-contingent loans and create an artificial hedge to remove that condition for investors.  Is that the way you are thinking?
defaultMr Willettsdefault: These are exactly the types of issues that our expert advisers are looking at.  We have made it clear that we are not going to change those repayment rules.  As to exactly how you handle that in terms of the structure of the sale, Mr Harrison may want to comment.
defaultMichael Harrisondefault: This is exactly the sort of thing we are working on at the moment as part of the preparatory phase, but no decision has yet been taken.  That was the advice Rothschild gave us a couple of years ago.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ129 default&#xa0; 
defaultKaty Clark:default Could you expand a little on 
defaultyour thinking and 
defaultwhere you are in that process?  I appreciate that no decisions have been taken.  If you were to sell £12 billion of 
defaultdebt under those terms, how would you do that
default,
default given the advisers estimate that you could offload only £2 billion?
default  Can you g
defaultive us a bit more information
default?
defaultMichael Harrisondefault: The Rothschild report was in November 2011 and that formed the basis of the feasibility work, which took us into this new phase.  We are revisiting all those assumptions with our new advisers, Barclays, in conjunction with Rothschild, to make sure we do get the right structure for the current market conditions, which have moved on quite a lot from two years ago.  If anything, the market conditions are a bit more buoyant now in the debt and equity markets, so we really need to think about the structure of the current market.  Some of these decisions can be taken only quite close to the point of action or in relation to the sale
default,
default so it is fine
default-
defaulttuned to the particular market conditions at the time.
defaultMr Willettsdefault: Financiers come up with these names.  The device of a synthetic hedge, which sounds to most of us like plastic grass, is one option that Rothschild looked at as an attempt to construct for a future purchaser a flow of revenues, as if the base rate plus 1% rule did not exist.  That is a candidate.  It has not been decided, but that is the kind of thing you could do.  I re-emphasise 
defaultthat 
defaultwe have made 
defaultit 
defaultclear that we are not going to change the actual rules on the repayment formula for real graduates.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ130 default&#xa0; 
defaultKaty Clark:default You are considering this artificial hedge.  Is there anything else you are considering that you could share with the Committee?
defaultMr Willettsdefault: It is quite early, and these are exactly what our advisers are looking at.
defaultMichael Harrisondefault: Very broadly, we cannot possibly sell all of the pre-Browne loans
default, which 
defaulthav
defaulte 
defaulta face value of £45
default&#xa0;
defaultbillion
default,
default in one go, so we need to think about how the sales will be segmented
default—
defaultthat is, in terms of a multi-stage sale process, which loans are sold and when, and what markets we target. Those are the things we are principally going through at the moment, together with the commercial preparatory work that we need to do for a very large sale.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ131 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechin:default Mr Harrison, are there any other examples, nationally or internationally, of such synthetic hedges on the scale we are talking about here?
defaultMichael Harrisondefault: No. We are dealing with a very specific issue in relation to the loan terms that we have now.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ132 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechin:default So i
defaultt is unique in international global markets to have a sale of debt of this nature with this type of arrangement.  I would have thought the risk to the taxpayer if you do not make the right calculations could be really adverse.
defaultMichael Harrisondefault: This particular structure is unique.  The concept of having an instrument sold in conjunction with something else is quite common in the market, though, so that will not be a surprise.  As David said, this 
defaultis 
defaulta new asset class and there are a number of issues we need to address in the market which will necessarily be different from what we have seen before.
defaultMr Willettsdefault: If I might add, the taxpayer has a risk at the moment, which in a way we are going through at the present.  When base rates are very low, graduate repayments end up being very low, so it is a real-world risk for the taxpayer anyway.  Part of the logic of the sales, where you can do it, is to shift some of these risks, but the one way we are not going to do it is by changing the repayment terms for graduates.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ133 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Can I summarise the position?  In his autumn statement, the Chancellor said that the expansion of student numbers would be financed by the sale of the student loan book.  We now have the Government’s advisers saying in effect that, depending on whether the Government provide some sort of artificial subsidy to the purchaser, the sale price could be as little as £2 billion
default,
default when the autumn statement predicated its figures on £12
default&#xa0;
defaultbillion.  That is quite a serious black hole.  How are you going to address it?
defaultMr Willettsdefault: The document to which you are referring was a
default 2011
default assessment looking at a specific set of issues, including this repayment issue, and in very different market conditions.  One of the reasons we are intending to proceed is that we think circumstances are now a lot better, and our advisers are optimistic about what they can secure.  The document then was very different from the circumstances we face now.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ134 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default What are Rothschild advising you at the moment it will get?
defaultMr Willettsdefault: We are at the stage where they are doing a lot of work on the valuation framework and the mechanics for sale.  That is continuing work and no final decisions have been taken on the mechanics.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ135 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default As yet, you have not been given any advice that gives substantial reassurance that that black hole has disappeared.
defaultMichael Harrisondefault: We have been given very specific advice that market conditions have improved since that report was given, so we know that the general environment is stronger than it was before.  That is why we are revisiting that sort of issue
default;
default so that sort of instrument may or may not be required in any future sale.
defaultChair:default Wings and prayers come to mind.
defaultMr Willettsdefault: No; it is a clear intention.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ136 default&#xa0; 
defaultCaroline Dinenage:default The National Audit Office was concerned that the Government 
defaultdoesn’t 
defaulttarget the amount of money it collects each year.  Do you agree that such a target would be useful for transparency?
defaultMr Willettsdefault: The National Audit Office report was very useful, and we have accepted its recommendations.  One comment I would make about the question is that here we are talking about repayments over the next 30 years that will be dependent on a host of factors: the performance of the economy and the jobs market, 
defaultearnings, 
defaultand women’s earnings relative to men’s.  The HMRC are still in the early days of forecasting income tax receipts
default,
default 20 years out.  With all those macro-economic issues, nobody can expect you to reach those kinds of rigorous forecasts as far ahead as we have to look with graduate loans.  What you can do is try to ensure that the Student Loans Company gets on with ensuring
default that 
defaultgraduates meet their financial obligations—this was Mr Binley’s earlier point, quite rightly
default—
defaultthat it does 
defaultso 
defaultefficiently
default,
default that we 
defaultdon’t 
defaultmiss a trick and 
defaultaren’t 
defaultoutwitted
default,
default and that money due is collected.  That we can focus on, but it is very important to disentangle 
defaultthese points
default.  If graduate repayments are lower because average earnings are lower than forecast, that is different from graduate repayments being lower because the Student Loans Company fails to pursue people efficiently.  We have to disentangle those different effects.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ137 default&#xa0; 
defaultCaroline Dinenage:default Forgive me
default—
defaultare you saying targets are useful for transparency, or not?
defaultMr Willettsdefault: It is useful to set a target for given economic circumstances, provided people understand that
default, for example,
default over the last few years earnings growth has been less than most external forecasters expected. That affects graduate repayments; it does not of itself mean that the Student Loans Company has proved to be incompetent.
defaultMatthew Hiltondefault: On the specifics of the target, there is a difference between targeting and forecasting.  It is important to think about our work with the Student Loans Company in the context of the SLC doing their work as part of the HMRC system.  The HMRC does not have a target for tax collection; it has a strategy that looks at maximising yield and reducing the gap between what it should get and does 
defaultactually
default get.  What we can do—this was the thrust of the report—is work more sharply with the SLC, which we are trying to do, and work alongside HMRC to ensure we maximise efficiency in that way.  It is a slightly different question from just imposing a monetary target
default,
default and a slightly broader approach to strategy than that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ138 default&#xa0; 
defaultCaroline Dinenage:default 
defaultI think that t
defaulthe National Audit Office sympathises
default, recognising
default that it is very difficult to set a target that relies on wider economic variables, and of course that is going to be outside your Department’s control in the wider remit.  I wondered if you felt it would be helpful to have some form of target as a starting point for a 
default“
defaultcomply
default 
defaultor
default 
defaultexplain
default”
default basis.
defaultMr Willettsdefault: We have accepted the recommendations in the NAO report, and we now have to work out a sensible way forward that disentangles these different effects.
defaultMatthew Hiltondefault: We could target the SLC against a sharper strategy, but, as I said a moment ago, the real work lies in establishing what that strategy actually is.  I do not want to target them with something that does not make any sense.  I am sure we can get a crisper target, but I do not think that it will be, as you said a moment ago, a monetary one.
defaultMr Willettsdefault: Perhaps I can comment on the recommendations of the NAO.  BIS does not currently set a collections performance target.  In our response, we have said that we intend to mirror and adapt the HMRC approach to collection performance by undertaking work to identify the student loan repayment gap; identify weaknesses in our system; identify specific yield activities, such as overseas borrowers; follow up employer start notices fast using RTI data—absolutely practical things—and set a longer-term target to increase, score and track the activities against them.  We are working through the NAO’s recommendations
default—
defaultprovided 
defaultthat 
defaultwe do not get ourselves into the implausible position of setting a figure for five years’ time and, when earnings undershoot, suddenly we are all told that we have failed.  It has to depend on the changing circumstances.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ139 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechin:default We talked earlier about graduate borrowers who are living abroad.  The NAO report said that over three quarters of the overdue payments from that group had been overdue for between one and four years.  What are you doing to chase these loans harder
default,
default given it is likely that the number of graduate borrowers who live abroad will increase and the amount owed per graduate will also increase?
defaultMr Willettsdefault: We are stepping up the procedures for overseas borrowers.  For example, we are improving online statements so they can see where they stand.  We are trying to make it easier for overseas borrowers to repay through the introduction of PayPal or other electronic overseas repayment methods.  We are also creating much stronger incentives for them to repay by communicating to them that, if their repayments pause—
defaultif 
defaultwe have asked them for information and they are not providing it—they are racking up interest at RPI plus 3%, no matter what they are earning
default, and t
defaulthat will remain until the Student Loans Company receives the information requested.  We are absolutely trying to put pressure on borrowers overseas.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ140 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechin:default But you will appreciate that the longer the debt remains unpaid
default,
default the risk of its having to be written off increases exponentially.  What are you doing to try to get more people to repay when their arrears are less than one year?  Clearly, once you go past one year to two years
default,
default you may as well, in most cases, forget about seeing the debt coming back ever again in a commercial sense.  What is the Student Loans Company doing to try to get those figures down?
defaultMr Willettsdefault: One thing we are doing is to contact EU borrowers before they graduate to make sure we have their correct contact details when they leave the country.  To get the scale of this, 41% of EU students pay their fees up
default-
defaultfront because they never take out a loan, compared with 9% of English ones
default;
default and about 20% of EU students who do take out a loan repay it immediately on graduation, which is a much larger proportion than 
defaultUK
default students.  We have quite effective systems for checking.  Often, these people want to settle their loans.  We are absolutely up for continuing to pursue them.  Earlier in this session, we heard the figure of £45 billion given as the pre-Browne income-contingent loan stock.  Of that, I think £450
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion, or 1%, represents EU borrowers, although I will happily write to the Committee if that is incorrect.  We are absolutely energetic about it, but sometimes the picture given is that somehow we are being ripped off by these people.  We are energetic in pursuing them, and it is a small part of the total picture.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ141 default&#xa0; 
defaultAnn McKechin:default The point is that 
defaultUK
default graduates working abroad are becoming an increasing strain.  The other point is that 43% of the 368,000 borrowers with no employment record have not provided information to confirm whether or not they are earning enough to repay.  Are you confident that you do not have a problem with people basically avoiding making repayments?
defaultMr Willettsdefault: We are improving this.  In the past, the Student Loans Company did not do enough to keep in contact with people when they went abroad, and the new powers we have with the RPI plus 3% penalty mean we can keep in contact with them.  The Student Loans Company is much more focused on getting information.  They also know that there are penalties down the track if they should be repaying or providing information and they do not, and ultimately we will pursue them through the courts in the EU or elsewhere.  You cannot pursue someone living somewhere else through the courts to repay a graduate tax; you can pursue them through the courts if they have contractual obligations to repay, and we have done so and will do so. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ142 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default Can we talk about students with parents who are Turkish, and who get the loan through self-certification?  
defaultTurkey
default is well-known for 
defaulthaving 
defaulta slightly leakier border than most.  
defaultThe 
defaultconditions
default state
default: “A student who is the child of a Turkish worker who is 
defaultordinarily resident in the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default, and who is or has been lawfully employed in the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default”—one assumes that is at some stage—“can also apply for…loan and maintenance support.”  I wonder how we check that out in a country that does not quite have the standards of border control that even this country has.  
defaultMr Willettsdefault:
default I do not want Anglo-Turkish relations to plummet as a result of this, so we had probably better not get into this.
defaultMr Binley:default I think the Turks would admit they have a problem, and they are concerned about it. 
defaultMr Willettsdefault:
default As t
defaulthey are not part of the EU
default—y
defaultou have touched on this, Mr Binley, and you are absolutely right
default—s
defaultomeone would only have an entitlement to 
defaultloans 
defaultif they had been resident in the 
defaultUK
default for three years.  That would be the criterion on which they claimed, rather than anything else.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ143 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default “Or has been lawfully employed in the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default”.  It is that second bit that provides a bit of an open door.  
defaultMr Willettsdefault:
default Yes, and we do need to be very rigorous in ensuring that people have genuinely been resident for three years and have the documents to prove it.  If they do not have the documents to prove it, they are not entitled to loans.  We have, most recently in the case of Romanian and Bulgarian students, absolutely gone through a set of checks.  What happened was that there seemed to be an unusual proportion of students who were—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ144 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default We stopped the loans, did we not, on 13 October?
defaultMr Willettsdefault:
default We did.  We said to all of them, “We are stopping all loans.  Now, come back to us with the documentary evidence that you have actually been living in the 
defaultUK
default for three years, and then we will restart the loan.”  This is exactly how we are always policing this system.  As you said earlier, Mr Binley—and you are quite correct—the 
defaultUK
default taxpayer should not be paying out any loans where there is not clear legal entitlement.  We are very rigorous about that, and so we should be.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ145 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default Can I just follow that up?  There was a suspicious surge—to use, I think, your own Department’s language—and they were frozen on 13 November because of student loans to Romanians and Bulgarians
default, s
defaultome of 
defaultwhom 
defaultcame 
defaultthrough 
defaultTurkey
default.  Can you tell me what the latest is on that?  You will know that there is some concern about this whole issue.  
defaultMr Willettsdefault:
default Yes. 
defaultSome
default 7,448 students had their payments blocked and received letters asking for additional evidence on residency.  These are the latest figures I have, and I will happily update the Committee if the
defaulty
default are out of date.  Of these, 2,783 have now replied with evidence
default, and 
default853 have already had their payments reinstated.  Those are the latest figures here, but I will happily go back and check if there is any further update.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ146 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default So you have dealt with just under half of them so far.
defaultMr Willettsdefault:
default Yes.  Of course, if we do not hear from them again—
defaultMr Binley:default Then that is the end of it.
defaultMr Willettsdefault:
default —they have no entitlement.  They have to come back a
defaultnd offer evidence, and we cross-
defaultcheck the further evidence.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ147 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default I am grateful for that.  The point I am making is that we do need to check.  I want to be assured that we are checking. 
defaultMr Willettsdefault:
default Absolutely. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ148 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default We have discussed the issue of RAB charges before, Minister.  You will recall that, in those distant days when we were debating a new funding regime, your projection for the RAB charge was 28%.  That was subsequently revised upwards
default,
default through 30% to 32%.  I think in a parliamentary answer last week, you conceded the RAB charge for post-2012 loans was now 40%.  You will remember that HEPI consistently stated the figure at 38%.  Back in October 2012, when the Secretary of State came to see us, he described HEPI’s calculations as nothing more than—and I quote—“An outlier in the debate”.  Would you concede that, actually, they got it broadly right?  
defaultMr Willettsdefault:
default I do not want to suggest I am in a kind of grudge match with Mr Bahram.  I think his calculations as to how he got to the 40% were not calculations that we accepted then or accept now. The main thing that has happened in the years since we made that original forecast is very simple: earnings are not growing by as much as forecast.  What therefore happens is that, twice a year, in the budget and the autumn statement, there is a new OBR earnings forecast.  We assiduously recalculate what we think is likely to be repaid, because this means that essentially
default,
default the £21,000 repayment threshold has risen relative to average earnings.  We come up—and we can only work on the basis of authoritative forecasts—with a new RAB charge.  This, due to what has happened in the economy in the past few years with earnings underperforming, has always been higher.  
defaultAt some point in the future—I suspect long after I have ceased to be the Minister—we will have a burst of earnings inflation
default, and t
defaulthere will be a time when a Minister is able to come to this Committee every six months and announce the RAB charge is down.  I am sure we will say it is because of his extraordinary skill in running the Student Loans Company and collecting money.  However, he will actually be riding macroeconomic trends.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ149 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default I appreciate the comment about not having a grudge match with Bahram, but the factor you cite in terms of earnings was actually the 
defaultone 
defaultwhere he said you
default’
defaultd got it wrong, wasn’t it?  
default              
default              
default              
default              
default              
default              
default              
defaultLet me move on.  Casting my mind back to October 2012, you wrote in 
defaultThe Independent
default that when calculating the RAB charge, “HEPI assumes the worst outcome for taxpayers on pretty much every variable”.  Given that they said 38%, and you have now conceded 40%, can we therefore conclude that the taxpayer has indeed suffered the worst outcome?  
defaultMr Willettsdefault:
default This goes back to my point
default—i
defaultt is possible that he has been right for the wrong reasons.  That is why it sounds like a grudge match.  It does not follow that the RAB charge
default’s
default having got to 40% is because the exact calculations that he made then were correct.  The big thing is earnings.  Our forecasts
default,
default 30 years out
default,
default are incredibly sensitive to a change in earnings every six months.  To be honest, all we do as a 
defaultD
defaultepartment—and all we should do—is go on the OBR forecast.  We do not reach a separate view on earnings.  We just accept the OBR forecast and apply it.  Anything else would be very risky.  
defaultThere is a second issue, which is what we think is going to happen to the structure of graduate earnings.  This, again, is why
default,
default looking out 30 years
default,
default there are big imponderables.  What, for example, is going to happen to the pattern of women’s earnings as against men’s?  How much are earnings going to bounce around?  If you are going to have periods of high earnings, and periods of low earnings, that is better for repayments than if people are going to be stuck on low earnings.  When you are getting into the detailed modelling, you are having to take some quite ambitious views about the future structure of the British jobs market.  These RAB charges are highly sensitive to changes in views about things.  They will keep on changing, because nobody can know exactly what the structure of graduate earnings is going to be in 20 or 30 years’ time. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ150 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default You were fairly confidently talking about them back in 2012.  Can I just press the point?  You did describe a 38% RAB charge as the worst outcome for taxpayers.  What do you describe a 40% RAB charge as?
defaultMr Willettsdefault:
default What has happened is that, as earnings have grown by much less than expected, that means that graduates will be paying back less than was forecast at the time.  We have to always raise the game with the Student Loans Company, but the taxpayer has not lost out in the sense of the Student Loans Company having failed to collect money.  We are all, in this respect, passive in the face of big economic trends.  I cannot remember the details but I think that the reasons for the HEPI calculation of 40% were not quite the same as the factors I am now drawing to your attention today.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ151 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default Just out of interest, have you now incorporated into the Department’s modelling any of the HEPI factors that led to the 38% calculation?
defaultMr Willettsdefault:
default I really cannot remember the basis of that calculation by HEPI.  What I can say is that we are doing more work and it is showing.  We have commissioned outsiders.  This is not done internally; we have commissioned outside experts.  There are some factors at work that will increase the RAB charge.  It looks, for example, as if people on low earnings are more likely to be on low earnings consistently, and less likely to have periods of bouncing into high earnings, than was assumed in the original modelling.  Things like that will push up the RAB charge.  We are continuously working on all this.  You are trying to take a view of the structure of British earnings over the next 30 years, and that is why they are estimates that will change.  
default&#xa0;
defaultQ152 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default Might some of the modelling that you are doing currently in the Department suggest that the RAB charge will rise significantly beyond 40%?

defaulty keep the Committee informed of the developments of our thinking.  Certainly, a live issue that we are looking at at the moment is 
defaultthe 
defaultpatterns of earnings.  There is a kind of asymmetry.  If you have less variability in earnings
default—
defaultpeople in high earnings have already repaid their repayments, so the fact they are on high earnings for longer does not increase the amount we collect from them.  For the people on low earnings, if they are sadly stuck on low earnings rather than bouncing up for periods when they would be able to repay, that reduces the amount we collect from them.  That is an issue that our experts and outside advisers are focusing on at the moment. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ153 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default If I can just push a little bit more, I understand the basis that is creating this trend, but some of the modelling you are now doing suggests that the RAB charge might be high 40s or even above 50%. 
defaultMr Willettsdefault:
default I do not want to speculate on the future RAB.  I am levelling with the Committee.  This process whereby every few months the RAB charge goes up because of a new earnings forecast is almost inherent in the system when you have been in a recession and have had low earnings.  I do not think the process of revising the RAB charge is suddenly going to stop.  Indeed, as I said, I can imagine for someone in the future it is going to go the other way.  It is in some ways one of the rather frustrating features of this.  We are endlessly getting a new earnings forecast and endlessly recalculating it.  The changes in the RAB charge are not some kind of deep defect in the system; they are a consequence of the inherent nature of how the calculations are done.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ154 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Can I go on now to the strategy and future of student financing, in particular the Student Loans Company?  Last year, the Student Loans Company identified three strategic objectives, which I will just go through.  The first was the maximum collection of repayments due, and information about those who are or are not repaying.  The second was that borrowers understand repayment arrangements and fulfil repayment obligations. The third was to improve the efficiency of the Student Loans Company collections operation.  Dealing with these three strategic objectives in turn, first of all, how do you think you can ensure maximum collection of repayments due
default,
default etc?
defaultDavid Willettsdefault: I might ask Mr Hilton to comment but, essentially,
default 
defaultby collecting information promptly, keeping in touch with people who have borrowed, and being energetic in reclaiming it.  Do you want go through the performance measures in more detail?
defaultMatthew Hiltondefault: That does 
defaultexplain 
defaultmuch of our approach to this, and we touched on some of it before as well in relation to the discussion around the NAO report.  The key thing
defaults
default I would draw attention to is the role that the SLC leadership is playing, first of all, in managing the organisation from a position of some difficulty a few years ago, where there were some well documented difficulties with their performance, into a position where their performance is now relatively strong; and their plans for future investment, which we talked about earlier, with a multi-million-pound investment in a system that will completely redevelop the student experience.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ155 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default The first section of the question asked by the Chair
defaultman
default gets to the very point that concerns me enormously
default:
default information and the credibility of information
default. It 
defaultseems to me that we have relied so much on self-certifi
defaultcation, as it were, up to now. Po
defaultints were made by the Student Loans Company 
defaultabout 
defaulttheir objectives in 2013.  They have had
default not a massive time but 
defaulta little time to get on with it
default; w
defaulte are now halfway through the first month of 2014. What reports are you getting f
defaultrom them that their information-
defaultcollection is improving?  My information is that it needs to improve pretty dramatically.
defaultDavid Willettsdefault: What they have got a lot better at is accessing HMRC data online, and this matters at several points.  The first point it matters at is when prospective students apply for support—maintenance support in particular—when we need to know the personal financial circumstances of that student’s parents.  Compared, I have to say, with the system that we inherited in 2010, which was part of the problems that we had in those days, we now have a less clunky, more direct arrangement where
defaultby
default HMRC is giving SLC the data it needs about the earnings of parents.  There is then the
default 
defaultcollecting 
defaultof 
defaultthe 
defaultactual 
defaultloans through HMRC when 
defaultthey are due.  The HMRC/Student Loans Company online data-sharing has been transformed in the past two years.  That is a wild claim but I am going to stand by that.  A lot of it was almost paper stuff.  It was pretty shocking.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ156 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Binley:default It was awful stuff, wasn’t it? You are hopeful, though, that it will get even better
default?
default  I assume you think that that improvement will continue.
defaultDavid Willettsdefault: Mr Hilton has been working flat-out on this.  The Student Loan
defaults
default Company’s IT system is old and creaking, and it desperately needs replacement.  One always has to cross one’s fingers w
defaulthen talking about Government IT 
defaultprocurement contracts; we are in dangerous territory here.  We have had the Cabinet Office and lots of outside experts trawling all over it.  We have had a long and very rigorous procurement process, so the real moment when the collection procedures will be far more efficient is when we have the new IT system.  What we have been able to do
default,
default and will be going online with this weekend, I believe, or early next week, is the prospective student experience when you first apply to the Student Loans Company.  That
default,
default too
default,
default was dreadful and clunky
default; it wasn’t “
defaultsmart
default”
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ157 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default That is my next question, on th
defaulte second strategy
default. Are you
default confident that “borrowers understand repayment arrangements and fulfil repayment obligations
default”?
defaultDavid Willettsdefault: I have to pay tribute to the Student Loans Company.  Compared with the situation that organisation was in
default during
default 2009
default-
default10, when many of us had constituents who were just not getting money that was due to them during that crisis in the autumn of 2009,
default they have made great strides. 
defaultThe latest will be visible within a week, when the online application process will be much clearer and simpler.  There has been a much mo
defaultre logical process of pairing. 
defaultThe main questions are asked and, if you do say something which suggests there is a financial issue that needs to be pursued—it could be disability or whatever—you are directed into a subset of questions that everyone else does not need to bother with.  I trialled it myself the other week and it is a much clearer and more effective way of communicating the basic terms of the student loan, giving prospective students the information they need about it, and getting the key information from them.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ158 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I just want to ask how you respond to the third element of the strategy.  What is your reaction to the NAO’s recommendation t
defaulthat the company should use debt 
defaultcollection agencies to improve the efficiency of the operation?
defaultDavid Willettsdefault: I do not think we would rule that out.  As I say, the NAO report was very helpful for us, and anything that we can do that is practical and improves the ability to collect money, we will.  Most of it is, however, via HMRC, which is a unique feature of the system.  I thought that, in the past, we had used debt collectors but, certainly, if it would help, we will.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ159 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Walker:default I apologise for the fact that I had to step out earlier.  I just wanted to come back on some of what you were saying about improving the front end of this for students
default. 
defaultI have had quite a lot of feedback recently from constituents about problems with the front end
default. One particular 
defaultcase springs to mind where someone was being pursued for the full amount and 
defaultwasn’t 
defaultgiven any of the advantages of being worse off, right up until the point where their parents were declared bankrupt.  Clearly, something was not working in terms of the information about their parents’ earnings and how well off they were feeding through into the system, so any improvement on that front would be very helpful.
defaultComing back to Brian’s
default 
defaultpoint about overseas students, and British students going overseas, can you reassure us that the improvements to IT will help in making sure that payments are collected from those who can pay but simply move overseas?
defaultDavid Willettsdefault: On both of those points, we know the Student Loans Company needs to do even better.  It is better than it was but there is still more work to be done and, yes, we will be rigorous and energetic in collecting money.  We are absolutely committed on this, which is why we already putting big efforts into this.  People should not imagine they can go abroad and somehow escape their obligations—they cannot.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ160 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Bain:default Last month, the Committee heard from Toni Pearce of the National Union of Students, and it has concerns about the recruitment of HNC and HND students by profit-making providers.  Do you agree with the NUS’s position, which is that there is a fundamental objection to providers who are making a profit out of the education system?
defaultDavid Willettsdefault: I do not agree with that as a fundamental objection.  What matters is the quality of the education for the student
default,
default rather than the exact legal status of the provider.  That is perhaps a difference of philosophy between us.  I do care a lot about the student experience, and that is what matters.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ161 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Bain:default How would you reassure the NUS and other people in our country who would share the same view
default, who believe
default that, effectively, the state is subsidising the profits of private providers?
defaultDavid Willettsdefault: There are a range of providers of higher education.  They come in a surprisingly wide variety of legal forms and, I have to say, even under the previous Government, degree-awarding powers were given to, I think, one private provider, and I was not aware that it was any party’s philosophy that, in higher education, this should not be permitted.  All providers, however, need to be rigorously regulated through the Quality Assurance Agency and other bodies, because it is completely unacceptable if students are let down by shoddy and poor-quality provision.  In the past, the regulatory regime was so dependent on getting grants from HEFCE that the worst of the providers, under the system we inherited in 2010, were not being properly regulated. We are extending regulatory requirements and check-ups of the financial strength of the organisation, and QAA inspection, in a way that is more ambitious than it was in the past.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ162 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Bain:default Are you looking at extending the expectations of providers, which may be private or may come from different origins, as you have said, in terms of the taxpayers’ money they will be receiving?
defaultDavid Willettsdefault: We have to be careful here, because HNCs and HNDs are legitimate qualifications and we must be very careful about that.  What we did face was a very rapid growth in the number of students going through alternative providers and, to be honest, that was just a financial pressure.  We could not afford growth on the scale that was happening, so we have said to those alternative providers that were taking on extra students most rapidly that our baseline is their 2012
default&#x2011;
default13 student numbers.  We have had an upward financial pressure caused by the rate of growth in the number of students that they were recruiting.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ163 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default If I could just press a little bit more, from a slightly different angle, on this question—and it is something that I raised with you in the House before Christmas—there were a number of warning signals about the difficulties that we got into with alternative providers.  This Committee, back in November 2011, raised concerns.  There were calls for a moratorium in May 2012.  You conducted a consultation, which 
defaultended in March 2013, on student 
defaultnumber controls.  At that stage, on 27 March, you said, very confidently and very much in line with your policy trajectory, “Today’s announcement will enable alternative higher education providers to continue with their current plans rather than blocking planned expansion”
default;
default yet seven months later, you wrote to them suspending their designation and, effectively, blocking planned expansion.  Why did you ignore the warning signs?
defaultDavid Willettsdefault: What you call the trajectory
default—
defaultI believe in diversity of HE provision.  Above all, that is in the interests of students.  
defaultThere 
defaultare now seven alternative providers with their own degree-awarding powers
default. F
defaultour of them are now full universities, two of which, in turn, are for-profit
default: 
defaultthe 
defaultUniversity
default of 
defaultLaw
default and BPP University Ltd.  I continue to say and believe that that is, above all, to be judged by what is in the interests of students.  This is a new regulation that we have introduced in the last year or two, and what we are now saying is that a recent, successful QAA review is a prerequisite for applying for specific course designation.  What we have been doing is absolutely welcoming a wider range of providers, but extending to them regulatory and quality requirements like this QAA review.
defaultWhat has affected our calculations was a surge in the number of students, especially in sub-degree courses—HNCs and HNDs—which was at a greater rate and, frankly, simply a bigger number than we could afford.  Where we have suspended designations, it has been simply because of the costs of the rate of growth.  Remember that, although we are looking forward to entering a new world without number controls, there are in the current world number controls necessary to deliver public expenditure.  Alternative providers have had to accept, therefore, that that kind of rate of growth, when everyone else is having number controls, is simply not something that we can afford.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ164 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default Is it not true to say that these were the sorts of concerns that were raised during the consultation and were fairly 
defaultconfidently 
defaultbrushed aside by the Department and by you 
defaultlast 
defaultMarch, and that the failure to respond to those by introducing the sorts of controls that you subsequently did has left a black hole in the BIS budget, which is impacting on other areas of HE spend?
defaultDavid Willettsdefault: I would say that, when we look at what we have done in the past three years, we have gone a lot further than the system we inherited in extending both quality regulation and our ability to set
default out and impose number controls—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ165 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Blomfield:default I am sorry to interrupt, but my point was
default,
default the failure to act sooner did create a black hole in the budget, didn’t it?
defaultDavid Willettsdefault: No, because when—
defaultPaul Blomfield:default Was there no negative impact on the HE budget?
defaultDavid Willettsdefault: When it was clear what level of growth they were planning for the future, at that point we have, for example, told those providers with the most ambitious expansion plans for HNCs and HNDs that they should stop recruiting students to start these courses in 2013
default&#x2011;
default14.  When there was a signal of a budget pressure, we acted and, as a result, the growth 
defaultin the number of students at alternative providers will be much less than previously forecast.  We have done that and we have done it in time.  We have also attached a range of conditions to the designation of a course—both quality conditions and agreement to participate in number controls—that were not set in the past.  I would say that we have to get the balance right.  We want diversity but we have to live within our budgets.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ166 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Just to conclude, I have been trying to get 
defaultmy head 
defaultround the funding structure post the sale of income-contingent loans.  Tell me if I have this right: first of all, students would pay HMRC; HMRC would pay BIS; and then BIS would pay private companies.  Is that the correct flow of finance?
defaultDavid Willettsdefault: I am not sure that BIS particularly comes into it.  There is this idea of a server unit, which I might ask Mr Harrison to describe.
defaultMichael Harrisondefault: Broadly, the flow is correct, but instead of BIS it is a master-servicer function.
defaultChair:default It is what?
defaultMichael Harrisondefault: A master-servicer function.
defaultChair:default A master servicer—it sounds like a traditional engineering trade, but sadly it is not.  I think that other interpretations could be put on that, but we will not go down that road.  Go on.
defaultMichael Harrisondefault: The master servicer is the interface with investors.  Repayments come through HMRC to the master servicer and then on to investors.
defaultDavid Willettsdefault: The master servicer is within the public sector.
defaultMichael Harrisondefault: It is, yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ167 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default It does seem that it is a rather complex process and, presumably, there will be costs incurred by each element of that process and some sort of reimbursement.  Would it not be simpler just to have students paying the companies?
defaultMichael Harrisondefault: It is quite a common structure in transactions of this kind, because a simple interface between the investors and the organisation that has the repayments is, overall, lower-cost than having lots of individual arrangements with separate investors.  Overall, it is a lower-cost option for arranging the servicing.
defaultMr Binley:default I am not sure I believe that, frankly.  Will you write to us and give us the total detail, so that we can analyse it?  Forgive me, but I have heard this sort of nonsense before from people like Goldman Sachs and it turned out to be very unhelpful.
default&#xa0;
defaultChair:default It would be very helpful if you could spell out in detail how it would work and how it is a more cost-effective way, because I think, on the surface, there would be a fair degree of cynicism about that assertion.
defaultCan I just conclude by thanking you very much?  I think it is fair to say that there are a number of issues that have been raised, which we will want to comment on and put in our 
defaultreport, and we will welcome the Government response 
defaultto them 
defaultin due course.  There are certainly very serious issues that have to be fully thought through, and we will be making fairly robust and rigorous recommendations.  Thank you, Minister; that was very helpful.
