[normal]              
[normal]Executive Summary
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]All human persons, including convicted criminals, have an inalienable and irreducible status (human dignity), which is not at the disposal of the State and in which all rights and obligations are ultimately grounded. However human dignity, justice, and mercy are undermined by the blanket ban
[normal] that prevents prisoners from voting
[normal].
[normal] It is our view, therefore, that the blanket ban is, as a matter of principle, unjust, illogical, and morally wrong.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Prisoners do not cease to be UK citizens whilst in prison. The philosophical concept of ‘civic death’ has been rightly abandoned and therefore it cannot be used to justify the disenfranchisement of prisoners. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The generally accepted purposes of punishment are: retribution, incapacitation, deterrence, and reform and rehabilitation. The primary aim of punishment is the reduction of crime, the preservation of public order, and public safety. These aims are more likely to be achieved if prisoners are offered help to rehabilitate and change their behaviour; indeed, it is now generally accepted that purely retributive systems do not work
[normal]. Disenfranchising prisoners does not further the aims of punishment; however giving prisoners the vote might. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We stand to suffer as a nation, both at home and abroad, if we do not change our domestic legislation. The disenfranchisement of prisoners undermines the democratic legitimacy of Parliament, marks the beginning of a political underclass, reinforces the negative public perception of prisoners and thus hinders resettlement, weakens the European Convention on Human Rights (‘the Convention’), and weakens the authority of the UK when commenting upon human rights violations in other countries. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When a person enters prison it is only his liberty that is restricted, therefore a restriction of any of his other rights (including the right to vote) must be independently justified. Removal of the right to vote by virtue of imprisonment alone is disproportionate and cannot be justified. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A decision to flout the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights (‘ECHR’) will undermine the 
[normal]Rule of Law
[normal], it will set a bad example to other countries, and it may cause the UK to lose the respect of other parties to the Convention. Refusing to grant prisoners the vote may also result huge financial repercussions.

[normal]              
[normal]The Purpose of Punishment/Imprisonment
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]however it should be noted that the final three justifications share a common purpose/aim: stopping crime, maintaining public order, and thus keeping society safe.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Depriving such people of their right to vote only exacerbates the problem by furthering the divide between prisoners and the rest of society. If we truly wish to cut crime then we must not turn our backs on prisoners and forget about them; instead we should put them on the path to reform by showing them that they have a continuing stake in, and duty towards, the community into which they will return. We should encourage our prisoners to play a positive role in shaping their own futures by showing them that it is possible for them to better themselves and improve their situations by becoming authors of their own transformation. Restoring the vote
[normal] would renegotiate the balance between the rights of society and the rights of the individual, and it could show prisoners that there are ways to better oneself that do not involve committing further offences.

[normal]“Just being tough isn’t a successful strategy in itself. Come with me to any prison in this country. There you’ll meet muggers, robbers, and burglars. But you’ll also meet young people who can’t read, teenagers addicted to drugs, people who’ve never worked a day in their whole lives. These people need help so they can become part of the solution and not remain part of the problem. Recognising this isn’t soft, or liberal. It’s common sense. We’ll never create a safer society unless we give people, especially young people, opportunities and chances away from crime. Prevention is the cheapest and most effective way to deal with crime – everything else is simply picking up the pieces of failure that has gone before. That’s part of what I mean by being intelligent as well as tough….The only way to achieve our ambitions is reform – radical, intelligent reform. So much of what went wrong in public services previously wasn’t because the money was missing, it was because the methods were wrong.”

[normal]57% of all adults are reconvicted within one year of release, this rises to 57% for those who have served less than twelve months, and 67% for those who have served 11 or more previous custodial sentences. Almost 70% of all under 18 year olds are reconvicted within one year of release. If these individuals are reformed it stands to reason that the number of crimes committed will fall.

[normal]At any one time 10% of the prison population has “serious mental health problems”

[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]7% of male and 14% of female sentenced prisoners have a psychotic disorder; 14 and 23 times the level in the general population

[normal]In an assessment of 13-18 year-olds in custody, 35% of girls and 13% of boys were identified with depression, 17% and 7% respectively deliberately harmed themselves, and 16% and 7% respectively were identified with post-traumatic stress disorder 
[normal][Harrington, R., and Bailey, S. (2005) Mental health needs and effectiveness provision for young offenders in custody and in the community. London: YJB].

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]More than a quarter of women reported having been treated/ counselled for a mental health/ emotional problem in the year before custody, compared with 16% of men. [Ministry of Justice self-report study (2010)]
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A University of Oxford report on the health of 500 women prisoners, showed that women in custody are five times more likely to have a mental health concern than women in the general population, with “78% exhibiting some level of psychological disturbance when measured on reception to prison, compared with a figure of 15% for the general adult female population”.

[normal]‘Cameron is clear to defy Europe on human rights’,
[normal] 
[normal]The Times
[normal], 18 February 2011, 
[normal] 
[normal]published details of a leaked document providing legal advice to the Government on the consequences if the UK does not comply with the ruling of the European Court:  The leaked document...issues blunt warnings to ministers of the huge damage to Britain’s international standing if they ignore the Strasbourg court:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the submission, dated February 9, government lawyers estimate that in a ‘worst-case scenario’, 70,000 to 80,000 prisoners at any given time could claim compensation estimated at up to £143 million. But the document goes on to confirm that the Strasbourg court has no legal powers to force the Government to pay compensation for denying prisoners their human rights
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]Judge Bratza, former president of the ECtHR,
[normal] “The United Kingdom's contribution to the European Convention on Human Rights has been immense. British parliamentarians and lawyers played a key role in its conception and its drafting. British lawyers and, since the entry into force of the Human Rights Act, British courts have exerted a major influence on the way in which the convention evolves. This judicial dialogue is a key element in the proper operation of the convention, in which the role of national courts is critical.”
