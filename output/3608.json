"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Dr. Andrew Blick, Lecturer, Centre for Political and Constitutional Studies, King’s College London (CRJ 10)&#xa0;Introduction and summary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe constitutional role of the judiciary if there were a codified constitution&#xa0;\n1. \nAt present, the UK judiciary does\n not\n specifically carry out constitutional review, partly because there is no single express constitution\nal\n text to form a basis for such activity.\n Furthermore, the judiciary does not generally have a power to disapply or void Acts of Parliament\n. A broad principle of the UK constitution is that Acts of Parliament are supreme, and subordinate only to subsequent Acts of Parliament, which can amend or repeal earlier Acts either expressly or by implication.\n&#xa0;\n2. \nA\nn important change in the role of the judiciary, were the UK to introduce a codified constitution\n,\n is that it might well take on a role in assessing the actions of public authorities –\n including Acts \npassed by the\n UK Parliament \n–\n \nfor their compliance with the constitution as set out in the text. \nCourts\n could be empowered to quash those official actions that could not be reconciled with the constitution, including if necessary striking down Acts of Parliament.\n&#xa0;\n3. \nOn the surface this change is a dramatic one.\n \nIt could be seen as representing a shift away from a prevailing doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty to a system in which the constitution – held to be an expression of popular sovereignty – is supreme.\n&#xa0;\n4. \nAdvocates of a codified constitution might \nargue\n that \nthis enhancement of the role of the judiciary would be \ndesirable. They could find favour with the idea of \nconstitutional values – including individual rights and the rules governing the relations between different institutions \n–\n \nbeing more fully protected. They might also welcome the possibility \nthat fundamental constitutional principles could not be altered by simple legislati\nve\n procedures, but that a more demanding process would be required, as set out in the constitutional text\n.\n&#xa0;\n5. \nOpponents of constitutional codification might regard \nthis change as unfortunate. In their view, it might involve the courts – that lack the democratic legitimacy of Parliament – inappropriately involving themselves in political decision-making. It could also create consequent pressure for the politicisation of judicial appointments, s\nince legal decisions could hav\ne powerful implications for government public policy programmes.\n&#xa0;\n6. \nHowever, assessing the change in the role of the judiciary that codification migh\nt bring about is not a\n straightforward task. First, in some models for a codified constitution, the judiciary may not be given \na prominent role in the upholding of the constitution, and may not have the power to void primary legislation\n.\n \nThe Nordic countries, for example, restrict the courts in this regard. \nIn his proposed blueprint for a UK constitution, Tony Benn did not envisage that the judiciary would be abl\ne to review primary legislation. Benn\n \npreferred instead\n to retain parliamentary supremacy.\n&#xa0;\n7. \nSecond, \nthough the UK judiciary does not expressly carry out constitutional review, it does \nalready \nconduct assessments of public authorities against principles that could well be regarded as constitutional in nature. For \nexample\n, judicial review involves the consideration of whether decisions or actions are legal, rational and procedurally fair. \nThese principles\n –\n which many would regard as fundamental to\n the rule of law –\n are\n \nconstitutional\n, and \nwere\n, for instance,\n \nincluded in \nt\nhe C\nons\ntitution of \nthe Republic of \nSouth Africa\n of 1996 (s.33)\n.\n&#xa0;\n8. \nIt is conceivable that in future judicial review could develop a more clearly constitutional character. A tendency exists for the executive and other public bodies to publish codes – often without a statutory basis – setting out their core principles and procedural rules. These texts include the \nMinisterial Code\n, the \nCivil Service Code\n (that now has a statutory basis under the \nConstitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010\n) and the \nCabinet Manual\n. Feasibly\n courts could begin to use some of these documents in judicial review proceedings, perhaps arguing that they create a legitimate expectation that certain procedures be followed in decision-taking. By this means the juiciary could develop a greater constitutional role for i\ntself\n without full codification having taken place.\n&#xa0;\n9. \nHowever, traditional judicial review, though it can entail quashing secondary legislation, does \nnot allow for the \nassessment of\n \nthe validity of \nActs of Parliament. \nUnder the \nHuman Rights Act 1998\n, the courts can go further\n than they can under judicial review\n. As well as striking down secondary legislation, they can declare Acts of Parliament passed both before and after the 1998 Act incompatible with Convention rights\n (s.4)\n. The role of the judiciary thereby \nmeans that the rights contained in the Convention are enforced, and \nensures that the 1998 Act, and the existence of the Convention in UK law, are protected from implied repeal\n.\n But it falls to ministers and Parliament to resolve issues of incompatibility. The courts cannot strike down Acts of Parliament\n under the Human Rights Act\n; and would probably accept as law an Act of Parliament that expressly amended or repealed the 1998 Act\n, that is to say the stated this intention specifically\n.\n \nNonetheless\n, under the Act judges are required as far as possible to read legislation as compatible with the Convention\n (s.3)\n. In the process they can wield a great deal of discretion, even reading into the texts of Acts of Parliament words that were not included in \nthem\n.\n&#xa0;\n10. \nUK membership of the European Union, as provided for in UK law by the \nEuropean Communities Act 1972\n, entails European law taking precedence over domestic law. The courts are able to suspend the operation of an Act of Parliament that\n by implication\n \nconflicts with European law, as established in 1991 \nthrough\n the second \nFactortame \ncase. Yet, as with the Human Rights Act, \nthe courts would probably accept \nan Act of Parliament that expressly overrode \nthe European Communities Act\n.\n Nonetheless, the judiciary is already performing \nin relation to European law \na role akin to that which it might play under a codified constitution.\n&#xa0;\n11. \nLegislation produced by the devolved assemblies is subject to full judicial review. The judiciary can assess these laws both for their compliance with the ECHR and whether they are within the scope of the Acts of Parliament providing for devolution. In this sense, the swathes of \npolicy \nthat is \nnow devolved \nhave become\n subject to what could be regarded as constitutional review by the judiciary, where previously they \ncame within the remit of the UK Parliament and its ‘sovereignty’\n (though ultimately the authority of the UK Parliament is reserved to it)\n.\n&#xa0;\n12. I\nt should be noted for the purposes of the present \nCommittee \ninquiry that the \nActs of Parliament underpinning devolution include\n provisions for advanced scrutiny of \nbills passed by\n the devolved assemblies\n,\n to ensure they are within the bounds set out for them\n, before they are permitted to become law\n (see eg: \nScotland Act 1998\n ss.31-33)\n.\n Under a codified constitution, the courts might have such a pre-legislative scrutiny role, or it could be given to a \nbody which is not a court in the more \nusual\n sense of the term\n, perhaps an equivalent to the French Council of State.\n A process of this kind would mean that the constitutionality \nof an Act \nwas considered not only when challenged in relation to a particular case, but \nthat it was assessed in the abstract.\n&#xa0;\n13. \nThe UK Supreme Court now has a special role in relation to devolution issues. In this sense, it is beginning to resemble a constitutional court, and might well perform this function within a codified UK constitution. An issue to be considered is whether \nany court could consider a constitutional case, or whether it would have to be dealt with specifically by a constitutional court.\n&#xa0;\n14. \nFinally, \neven \nwithout a codified constitution being introduced\n,\n the courts may seek to assert an even greater role than they already possess with regard to the review of primary legislation, when applying what they see as fundamental constitutional principles. A view exists that \nparliamentary sovereignty is a creation of the common law: \nthat this doctrine came into being because it was recognised in judicial decisions, and that judicial decisions could therefore\n supplant it\n. The courts may \nat some point \nseek to establish a more sophisticated hierarchy of law, identifying core constitutional enactments as protected from implied repeal. Possibly the judiciary could also refuse to recognise attempts by Parliament to bring about what the courts saw as abrogation\ns\n of fundamental constitutional principles, such as a serious curtailment of the potential for the conduct of judicial review. Such a clash between Parliament and the judiciary would represent a serious constitutional crisis. It could be argued that the lack o\nf a codified constitution makes\n this kind of scenario more likely, since a constitutional text could make the boundaries clearer, discouraging both Parliament and the courts from exceeding their proper role.\n&#xa0;\nConclusion15. \nIt is likely that constitutional codification would expand the \nremit\n of the courts, giving them a more explicit role in upholding the text. This new set of functions could well include the capacity to disapply or void primary legislation; and p\nerhaps provide \nrulings on the constitutional \ncompliance\n of bills before they \nwere allowed to \nbec\no\nme Acts of Parliament. Such a role for the judiciary would be difficult to reconcile with the continuation of the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty.\n&#xa0;\n16. \nHowever, the present constitutional role of the courts should not be understated. It extends in some cases as far as being able to suspend primary legislation. Established doctrines suggest that Parliament, if determined enough, can have its way. However, judicial attitudes and practices are not static, and may develop \nin increasingly assertive ways.\n A codified constitution could be deemed necessary to restrain the courts, rather than augment them.\n&#xa0;\n18 \nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
