[[[Recommendation 24]]]&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]When revisiting a topic, previous recommendations and minutes are always referred to in order to remind the Committee of its original view and the circumstances which led to that opinion. This is especially important when there is a high turnover of members resulting in a short-term collective memory. &#xa0;The Chair, via the Clerk, regularly seeks informal feedback from the House Service about the performance of the Committee and how it could get the best out of witnesses. Likewise, the views of members have been sought about what is needed from witnesses to make meetings more effective. &#xa0;

[[[Recommendation 33]]]&#xa0;The Committee has only produced one report since the Liaison Committee made its recommendations. However, that report (First weeks at Westminster; induction arrangements for new MPs in 2015, HC 193, 2013-14) was shorter than previous reports at 100 paragraphs long and did put conclusions in bold and recommendations in bold italics.  The recommendations clearly identified who was expected to deliver the recommendation and where possible a timeframe for delivery. (The Committee finds the mnemonic ‘S.M.A.R.T.’ useful when considering the wording of recommendations to ensure that they are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-bound).&#xa0;For example:“We recommend that PICT consults this Committee by May 2014 on the detailed mechanics of how the post-2015 scheme for providing IT equipment to Members would work in practice”.               

[[[Recommendation 34]]]&#xa0;The Committee continues to ask the Clerk to ensure that sessions are scheduled into the Committee’s future programme when it can review, with those responsible for delivery, whether and how the recommendations in its reports have been acted upon. &#xa0;For example, in November 2013 it will be reviewing the delivery against recommendations in its Catering and Retail Services report (HC 560, 2010-12) and the report Visitor Access and Facilities (HC13, 2012-13).  The Committee has already scheduled a review of recommendations in its more recent report First Weeks at Westminster; induction arrangements of new MPs in 2015 (HC 193, 2013-14) to take place in May 2014.&#xa0;

[[[Recommendation 36]]]&#xa0;The Committee has had a high turnover of new members in the last 12 months. All new members to the Committee receive an induction pack with recent minutes and reports. Since April 2013 the Clerk, on the Chair’s behalf, meets all new members to learn more about their specific interests in the House Service and brief them on how the Committee works and what topics are currently being discussed. &#xa0;
