"&#xa0;\nSupplementary evidence from Rt Hon Alun Michael JP, Police and Crime Commissioner for South WalesI am writing to provide supplementary evidence to the oral evidence I gave to the Justice \nSelect Committee on the 11\nth\n September and I hope your colleagues will find this helpful.\nI very much welcome the Committee's inquiry into the co-ordination of crime reduction \npolicies. I have argued for many years now that all agencies need to take a partnership \napproach to crime reduction which is why I introduced Crime Reduction Partnerships as a \nkey element in what became the 1998 Crime and Disorder Act, which I will expand on later. \nIn my view one of the missing links in the system for ensuring a co-orientated approach to \ncrime reduction is to ensure that the courts have a duty to pay full attention to \"what works\" \nin reducing the likelihood \nand the seriousness of re-offending. At their best, the police do \nserve the clear policing objective set down by Sir Robert Peel that the first duty of the police \nis to prevent crime and disorder — though that cannot be done in isolation, and many of the levers in preventing crime fall outside of the hands of the police so partnership working is the \nonly way forward.\nStrides have been made in working collaboratively with local authorities in particular, and the \nNHS is another crucial partner. While there is still a long way to go, we are moving forward on that journey. I am concerned, however, that there simply hasn't been the same progress in our courts. For example, for some years I have argued that we should be much clearer \nabout \nour \nexpectations of the Criminal Justice System as a whole. You will recall that I \nmoved amendments in the House of Commons when I was a member of your committee \narguing that the Sentencing Council should be given as its key purpose the responsibility of \ninforming and advising the judiciary (including magistrates) about the effectiveness of \ndifferent sentences in protecting the public through reducing the likelihood of the offender \nreoffending.\nThis view is supported by the Ministry of Justice itself which states in its written evidence to\n \nyour Committee that \n\"When passing sentence, the court must have regard to the statutory\n \npurposes of sentencing, which include the reduction of crime\" \nand that regard must be given\n \nto \n\"the cost of different sentences and their relative effectiveness in preventing re-offending... \nUnderstanding what works in reoffending is \na \npriority for government.'\nA similar view was put forward in the Justice Select Committee's Report on Justice \nReinvestment which says we should be\n:\n\"looking to the judiciary to adopt an active role within local criminal justice boards so that the\ny\n \nbetter understand the outcomes of their sentencing decisions, and are enabled to draw lessons from what happens to those they sentence; judges and magistrates should be \nencouraged to work closer with criminal justice agencies as has been proved successful in community, and drug and alcohol, court initiatives\nand identifies that a holistic approach to reform is necessary \n\"with a very clear and explicit \nstatement of the purpose of the whole system against which organisational aims can be \ntested to assess their contribution to cutting the extent and seriousness of offending and \nreoffending.\n”\nBut this message still doesn't seem to be adopted by the judiciary. Recently I asked the \nchairman of the Sentencing Council, Lord Leveson, when he agreed that there was a need \nto put more emphasis on informing the courts about \"what works\" in making offenders less \nlikely to offend again, and he responded rather bizarrely by saying that we needed to ask \nthat question of community sentences but not of prison sentences. Again, this is complete \ncontrast to the challenge laid down by the Select Committee in 2009 that \n\"the role of the \nSentencing Council \nshould\n.\n be \nto ensure that sentencing practice succeeds in reducing \noffending and re-offending\"' \nIt's encouraging that services like probation and the prisons are \nkeen to work with us and very positive about the help they get from services like education, \ntraining and health that come under Welsh Government.\nIt is important to be mindful that the context in Wales is different to that in England. In Wales \nmany of the levers used in crime reduction fall within the remit of the Welsh Government \nsuch as housing, health and education.\n&#xa0;\nAnd the Welsh Government has taken its role very seriously. Welsh Ministers have provided \nus with\n \n500 additional Community Support Officers to work with local communities to reduce \ncrime; they are introducing the world's first legislation specifically targeting preventing \nviolence against women; and they have provided grant funding for an innovative Community \nSpeedwatch project in South Wales to target speeding in the most socio-economically \ndeprived areas. They are also taking a lead role in collaborative working encouraging Local \nGovernment to work on a footprint model, for example in South Wales there is a project \nunderway to merge Bridgend, Swansea and Neath Port Talbot's youth services to share\n \nresilience and best practice across the region.\n&#xa0;\nWelsh Government ha\ns\n also sought to engage Commissioners and the four Welsh Police \nand Crime Commissioners meet ministers regularly. Also, I currently sit on both the Reform \nDelivery Group, and t\nhe Finance Sub-Group working in \npartnership with Ministers and Local \nGovernment leaders to develop a response to current challenges. These are opportunities \nnot afforded to my counterparts on the other side of Offa's Dyke.\n&#xa0;\nHowever, much as I applaud national commitment to crime reduction, it cannot just be done \nnationally. A national strategy for crime reduction will only work as an aggregation of local \naction and with an understanding of the local context.\n&#xa0;\nOne of the key partnerships in reducing crime is the health service, and I take a victim-\ncentred approach seeing crime as a public health problem — both in terms of reducing \nvictims who suffer visible injuries as a result of a violent crime, as well as the psychological impact on victims who may have suffered from the effects of long term anti-social behaviour, \nfor example. I have attached an essay I wrote earlier in the year which outlines the approach \n&#xa0;\nI am taking and the ways in which I am working with partners.\n \nI am also working more widely with partners across South Wales to reduce crime through \nSafer South Wales — a board which meets quarterly and brings together the Police with local \ncouncils, Youth Offending Team managers, Probation, the Ambulance and Fire services and \nHealth Board representatives. This gives us a broad range of perspectives to share \nconcerns and work together on a co-ordinated approach. For more specialised issues on \ncriminal justice matters, I have reconstituted the South Wales Criminal Justice Board \nbringing together strategic leads from the Criminal Justice Agencies to work towards a more \nefficient and effective system and increase confidence in the system in South Wales. I also \nmeet the Safer South Wales Action group — a more practitioner led group which co-ordinates \nthe delivery of strategy from Safer South Wales across the force area.\n&#xa0;\nThese issues are central to my Police and Crime (Reduction) Plan — I have included \nReduction in the title of my plan, though it is not prescribed in the legislation as I believe this is what should be at the core of everything we do. Prior to becoming an MP, as you know I \nwas a youth worker in some of the most deprived areas of Cardiff and worked with young \noffenders as well as chairing the (then) City Juvenile Bench. I saw the impact that youth \noffending had not only on the victims of crime, but on the future of the offenders themselves \nwho became weighted down with criminal records before they even finished school. That is \nwhy I established Youth Offending Teams in the 1998 Crime and Disorder Act which have \nbeen hugely successful in reducing offending. The upper age limit of 18 was there simply \nbecause it made sense to tackle offending at a young age rather than being a fixed ceiling. I \nhave therefore made it a priority in my Plan not only to continue working on tackling youth \noffending, but to extend this to the 18-25 age group.\n&#xa0;\nH\naving said that, it is vital that at the heart of all of my work on crime reduction are victims of \ncrime — and witnesses of crime who often themselves feel victimised. When the Justice Select Committee inquired into the needs of victims, I asked the then Chief Executive of \nVictim Support to summarise what victims want and need. She answered that what victims \nwant, more than anything else (other than not to have become a victim in the first place) is to know that it's not going to happen again\n.\n&#xa0;\nWe need to make sure that victims are treated properly within the criminal justice system. Going to court is too, often an experience of re-victimisation, and that must change. But it is \nalso imperative that we prevent offending, reoffending and re-victimisation — prevention here \nis most definitely better than cure.\n&#xa0;\nThe police role is vital - not on their own, but as part of the team with other agencies. \nVictims need to see the police as being \"on their side\" and I strongly support my Chief \nConstable's commitment to improving victim satisfaction with the police response to crime \nand anti-social behaviour.\n&#xa0;\nThis was my philosophy in the development of the 1998 Crime and Disorder Act, not only \nintroducing local partnerships and evidence based policing in Youth Offending Teams but \nextending this into wider community safety through Crime Reduction Partnerships renamed \n\"Community Safety Partnerships\" in Wales - which have quietly and effectively beavered \naway at making the public safer in our communities bringing together the Police, Probation, Fire and Health services with Local Authorities at a local level. This should be a cross party \nmantra because these principles were reinforced in the 2011 Police and Social \nResponsibility Act and in the role of Police and Crime Commissioners.\n&#xa0;\nIt's worked across England and Wales, but I suggest that it has worked particularly well in \nSouth Wales because it fits with the nature of strong local communities and the style of police leadership in recent times. We've also seen strong collaboration between the four \nWelsh chief constables and their teams, providing a healthy precursor for the arrival of \ncommissioners with the same combination of being both independent in spirit and \ncollaborative in practical matters. And that's been helped by the style of Government in \nWales, with the emphasis on a \"public health\" approach and on protecting services and \ncollaborative working.\n&#xa0;\nAnother key success of the 1998 Act was the Anti-social Behaviour Order — more commonly \nknown as the ASBO. This arose from widespread public concern with low-level antisocial behaviour and not just with serious crime. Thankfully few people are directly affected by \nhomicide but large numbers of people in South Wales know about litter and graffiti and noise \nnuisance and the trauma of living next to the \"neighbours from hell\n.\n”\n&#xa0;\nAnd we also recognised the complexity of the public response to crime and disorder. During \ndozens of meetings on run-down estates up and down the country I heard the authentic \nvoice of local anger about local youngsters being out of control, only for the same person to \nsay later in the meeting \".... and there's nothing for the kids to do around here\". Many of \nthose who most passionately asked us to be \"tough on crime\" also demanded action to \n\"tackle the causes of crime\".\n&#xa0;\nI had never intended for the order to be used against young people who do not have a well \ndeveloped sense of risk — and the high breach rate amongst young people, one of the \njustifications being used by the current Government to scrap the ASBO, supports my view \nthat these types of orders just don't work for that age group. They were intended for adults and indeed the Act itself applied the ASBO only to adults.\n&#xa0;\nThe reason that the ASBO worked well is that whilst the Criminal Justice System is very \ngood at looking a\nt a\n snapshot of a single event, it is not very good at dealing with the moving picture of low-level crimes which can have a real impact on quality of life, both for individuals and communities. That's why I believe there is still a key role for the ASBO in tackling crime.\n&#xa0;\nIt was introduced as a civil order, which meant that professional witnesses could be used in \ncourt, for example Housing Officers, Community workers, and Police Officers. As intended, \nthat protects victims from any negative repercussions from offenders and makes early \nintervention more likely. A breach of the Order would then be considered a criminal offence \nand be subject to the higher burden of proof, and the offender arrested as a deterrent.\n&#xa0;\nThe involvement of housing authorities and local authorities as well as the police was \nanother recognition that crime reduction isn't something the police can deal with in isolation.\n&#xa0;\nThe figures show that most anti-social behaviour stops following a letter or some alert from \nan authority that they are committing anti-social behaviour (65% after the first intervention, 86% after two and 93% by the third intervention). I think there is a good case for intervening \nat the start — making people aware that they are causing a problem before neighbourhood relations deteriorate — and using community mediation to let offenders hear how their actions \nare impacting on the lives of others. That's the way to enable people to escape from even \ngetting an order or an injunction against them. Such an approach has benefits socially, \nenvironmentally and financially, and it works.\n&#xa0;\nHowever, I also think that we need some form of deterrent. That was why I thought, and still \nthink, it is vital there is the threat of arrest, a criminal prosecution and potentially even jail for \nserious breaches. Our police tell me that these orders are being used to manage offenders \nwithin the community, through the threat that if they do not comply they are liable to have the \npolice come knocking. Nationally, changes of direction are damaging to local work and local\n \naccountability and retard partnerships and working patterns developed over a number of \nyears.\n&#xa0;\nThis all links back to the findings of the Justice Reinvestment report by the Justice Select \nCommittee that a number of the levers which affect crime and anti-social behaviour fall \noutside of the criminal justice system'. A co-ordinated partnership approach is the only way \nto ensure effective crime prevention, and I very much welcome the inquiry by the Select Committee in this area because it is an approach that works.\n&#xa0;\nI welcome the Ministry's commitment to providing up to 12 months support for all offenders —\nincluding those who have served less than 12 months. But this work needs resources and \nstability and efforts need to be made to ensure this is a truly joined up approach. Drug and \nalcohol intervention, mental health issues, housing services, education and training, \ncounselling and relationship services are all important if the cycle of offending is to be \nbroken. As a local prison governor said to me, it's about making sure on release someone \nturns left to local services, instead of right to the nearest pub.\n&#xa0;\nI have heard too many times from prisoners and ex-prisoners that they are better off inside with routine, hot meals and a bed than on the outside. It's shocking that only one third of \nprisoners reported being in paid employment in the 4 weeks before custody, that 13% \nreported never having had a job, 15% were homeless before custody and 25% were \nsuffering from anxiety and depression\nv\n.\n \nThat simply isn't right.\n&#xa0;\nAgainst this background the forthcoming changes to the Probation Service as well as the \nshift in legislation to tackle anti-social behaviour are deeply worrying. These changes \nthreaten to tear up partnerships and creating a great deal of uncertainty in the sector fuelled \nby a lack of evidence from pilots — which were cancelled in Wales. Mr Richard Johnson told \nthe Committee on 2 July 2013 that if you want the system to work, you would attach funding \ndirectly to an individual that would otherwise go to probation, prisons, police, health, \nemployment and housing to ensure a co-ordinated approach. The worst possible outcome \nwould be a silo mentality with each service only interested in their bit of the puzzle. Ironically \nthere is a better level of collaboration now than for many -years. We can only hope that will survive the current round of changes.\n&#xa0;\nAnd Justice cannot be totally divorced from Social Justice. Police and Local Government \nface hugely reduced budgets as are partner agencies and third sector organisations and \nmeanwhile welfare reforms are reducing the support available to people in our poorest \ncommunities. Pushing people to such dire situations can only result in an increase in \nadditional pressure on services later on. It makes early intervention even more difficult at the \nvery time when we need to create head room for services. Prisons and police cells should \nnot be used as a backstop where other agencies have failed.\n&#xa0;\nI \nam pleased to say that unlike some past periods of financial crisis, when there was a \ntendency to withdraw into \"core services\", many public bodies fully appreciate that only joint \nworking can bring about more effective preventative work and improved standards of \ndelivery. Strategic demands from government, the service demands of the end user, and \neffectiveness in serving the public all require a more joined-up approach in order to enable each part of the public sector to do more with less while coping with the effects of fundin\ng \ncuts.\n \n&#xa0;\nThis approach is actually supported in \nrelation to community safety by \nboth the 1998 Crime \nand Disorder Act, and the 2011 P\nolice and Social Responsibility \nAct.\n&#xa0;\nThe 1998 Act states:\n&#xa0;\n\"Section 17: Duty to consider crime and disorder implications.\n(1)Without prejudice to any other obligation imposed on it, it shall be the duty \nof each authority to which this section applies to exercise its various functions \nwith \ndue regard to the likely effect of the exercise of those functions on, and the need to do all that it reasonably can to prevent, crime and disorder in its area.\"The 2011 Act reaffirms this, and includes a specific reference to the Police and Crime \nCommissioner's responsibilities with regards to partnership working and engagement with \nthe Criminal Justice System:\n1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Police &amp; Crime Commissioner must, in exercising his functions, have regard to \nthe relevant priorities of each responsible authority.\n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Commissioner, in exercising his functions, and a \nresponsible authority, in \nexercising its functions conferred by or under section 6 of the Crime and Disorder Act \n1998 in relation to that police area, \nmust act in co-operation with each other.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Commissioner, and \nthe criminal justice bodies which exercise functions as \ncriminal justice bodies in that police area, must make arrangements (so far as it is appropriate to do so) for the exercise of functions so as to provide \nan efficient and effective criminal justice system for the police area.This is reinstated by the Commissioner's Oath of Office, which unlike the oath on becoming \nan MP pledges to serve the people living within the force area, and specifically spells out \nwhat the responsibilities of the Commissioner are, as follows:\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI will serve all the people of South Wales in the office of Police and Crime \nCommissioner.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI will act with integrity and diligence in my role and, to the best of my ability, \nwill execute the duties of my office to ensure that the police are able to cut \ncrime and protect the public.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI will give a voice to the public, especially victims of crime, and work with other\nservices to ensure the safety of the community and effective criminal justice.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI will take all steps within my power to ensure transparency of my decisions, \nso that I may be properly held to account by the public.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI will not interfere with the operational independence of police officers.\nThis is a very powerful set of requirements and I often use it when explaining the role of the \nCommissioner, not just to external organisations but also to the force and Chief Officers to \nshow that I have to have regard to all those factors which affect crime prevention and \nreduction. Part of this remit, explicitly, is ensuring an \neffective and efficient criminal justice \nsystem.\nAnother approach which I have taken as the cornerstone of my work are Peel's 9 principles \nfor policing:\n1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe basic mission for which the police exist is to prevent crime and disorder.\n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe ability of the police to perform their duties is dependent upon the public \napproval of police actions.\n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPolice must secure the willing co-operation of the public in voluntary \nobservation of the law to be able to secure and maintain the respect of the \npublic.\n4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe degree of co-operation of the public that can be secured diminishes \nproportionately to the necessity of the use of physical force.\n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPolice seek and preserve public favour not by catering to public opinion, but \nby constantly demonstrating absolute impartial service to the law.\n6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPolice use physical force to the extent necessary to secure observance of the \nlaw or to restore order only when the exercise of persuasion, advice, and \nwarning is found to be insufficient.\n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPolice, at all times, should maintain a relationship with the public that gives \nreality to the historic tradition that the police are the public and the public are \nthe police; the police being only members of the public who are paid to give full-time attention to duties which are incumbent upon every citizen in the \ninterests of community welfare and existence.\n8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPolice should always direct their action strictly towards their functions, and \nnever appear to usurp the powers of the judiciary.\n9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe test of police efficiency is the absence of crime and disorder, not the \nvisible evidence of police action in dealing with it\n&#xa0;\nAlthough these nine principles have stood the test of time, I believe a 10\nth\n principle needs to \nbe added to follow on from this to recognise that perception and reality are not the same. \nWhen the public are bombarded with \"bad news stories\" it is not surprising that the fear of \ncrime is often greater than the reality. My suggested 10\nth\n principle would be:\n\"Understand the real levels of crime, not just what is reported, and share this knowledge with the public to reduce the fear of crime.\"As well as the communications challenge this presents, there is a need to understand the \ntrue levels of crime rather than depending just on what is reported to the police. You will be \naware of the work of Professor Jonathan Shepherd in Cardiff who has worked scientifically \nto help the police and the council to drastically reduce levels of city centre violence through \nanalysis of the experience of victims presenting at A&amp;E.\nIn the 1990s police, councillors and media alike knew that violence was random and \nunpredictable in Cardiff City Centre. Police and NHS and others had to wait to see what \nhappened and react. The first results of the analysis of A&amp;E Data showed that this was \nsimply untrue. Violence was concentrated quite disproportionately in a small number of \nlocations. That information led to prophylactic deployment of police, discussions with \nrelevant licensees, better information for all emergency services and a significant drop in \nviolent incidents. Analysis of injuries led to the use of toughened glass and a reduction in the \nseriousness of many offences.\nInformation can be anonymised and used to target resources by time and location to prevent \nfurther violence. We are applying that sort of analytic approach to other manifestations of \nviolence and indeed other aspects of crime.\nIn these circumstances a focus on evidence (of need and of \"what works\") is essential to \nidentifying the most efficient course of action and the most effective partnership approach. \nReduction of pressure on partners is itself a tangible benefit, as is the cut in the number of \nvictims and the reduction of public fear and concern. It has to be underpinned by the \nprinciple of strategic agreement and tactical delivery.\nAt the core of this approach is a need to identify specific local places of concern with regards \nto incidents of violent crime using injury reports from Accident and Emergency units in \naddition to recorded incidents and police intelligence. Data on \"hotspots\" of violent incidents \nenables police deployment to target problem areas and cut offending. Better deployment of \nparamedics, ambulances and other emergency services can cut demand so that fewer people become victims of violent crime, fewer people present at A&amp;E and the injuries \npresented are less serious.\n&#xa0;\nIt is through these approaches and in partnership with agencies and voluntary groups across South Wales that I am trying to develop a co-ordinated, evidence-based approach to crime \nprevention. This is dependent on building relationships and understanding local needs and \nthe local context which needs to be recognised by Ministers, and by the Treasury. \nConsistent local action can change the national scene, but national action is only truly \neffective if it empowers effective local action.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;November 2013\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nPPC 14 — Written Evidence from the Ministry of Justice, Paragraphs 35-36\nCutting crime: the case for justice reinvestment, House of Commons Justice Committee (2009) Pg 8\niii\n Cutting crime: the case for justice reinvestment, House of Commons Justice Committee (2009) Para \n92\n1°\n Cutting crime: the case for justice reinvestment, House of Commons Justice Committee (2009) Pg 6 \nPPC 14 — Written Evidence from the Ministry of Justice, Paragraphs 38\n&#xa0;Reducing harm: Using a public health approach to tackling crimeIt's a great irony that one of the two great clarion calls for common sense on combatting crime came from \na Conservative Leader while the other came from a Labour Leader — over 150 years apart.\nEach offered powerful slogans based in clear principles and borne out by evidence. They show that \nneither political theory nor populist rhetoric can adequately define the role of the police in meeting the \nprime responsibility of the State - to protect its citizens.\nMy first champion for common sense is Sir Robert Peel, whose nine \"Peelian \nPrinciples\" (distilled by later\n \ncommentators from his speeches) boil down to two key principles :\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n\"The basic mission for the police is to prevent crime and disorder.\"\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n\"The Police are the public and the public are the police.\"\nMy second champion is Tony Blair whose approach was famously summed up in a single message\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n\"We must be Tough on Crime and Tough on the Causes of Crime.\"\nActually, it nearly didn't become famous. Tony became tired of repeating the message, and as his deputy I \nhad to keep reinstating it in one speech after another until a sarcastic comment by Michael Howard (Home \nSecretary at the time) provided the oxygen of media attention and we were able to expound and develop the practical ideas that underpinned the slogan.\nWe identified widespread public concern with low-level antisocial behaviour and not just with serious \ncrime. Thankfully few people are directly affected by homicide but large numbers of people in South \nWales know about litter and graffiti and noise nuisance and the trauma of living next to the \"neighbours from hell\".\nAnd we also recognised the complexity of the public response to crime and disorder. During dozens of meetings on run-down estates up and down the country I heard the authentic voice of local anger about \nlocal youngsters being out of control, only for the same person to say later in the meeting \".... and there's \nnothing for the kids to do around here\". Many of those who most passionately asked us to be \"tough on \ncrime\" also demanded action to \"tackle the causes of crime\". Our \"slogan\" grew out of listening to local \nexperience.\nThe imperative for sophisticated and responsible police leadership became clear after the polarised period of the Miners' Strike, when many Chief Constables sought to re-connect the polic\ne with the\n community. \nThey also gave enthusiastic support to the principles of partnership set out in the Crime and Disorder Act \n1998. Crime and Disorder Partnerships, Youth Offending Teams, the Youth Justice Board and preventative \ninterventions like the Anti-social Behaviour Order have all helped to make a real and lasting impact on \ncrime levels across England and Wales. As Peel rightly said, \n\"the efficiency and effectiveness of the police is proved through the absence of crime and not through the evidence of police action in dealing with crime\".The most significant statement of evidence-based principles came in December 2009 with a unanimous \ncross-party report from the Justice Select Committee after a major investigation into \nJustice Reinvestment. \"If you had all the money that goes into the Criminal Justice System today, would you spend it in the same \nway\n?\" Simp\nle answer\n: \"No!\"\n&#xa0;\nIt showed that most of the public policy factors that affect levels of crime and disorder are outside the \nhands of the police and the Criminal Justice System. Education, skills training, jobs, opportunity, housing, \nsubstance misuse, alcohol abuse, mental health and early intervention to \"nip things in the bud\" \nDO affect \ncrime levels.\nIn particular, mental health is an issue that is raised regularly. Research has shown that 70% of the prison \npopulation has two or more mental health disorders. So we are failing to identify people with mental \nhealth conditions and failing to get them to the help they need. Individuals with mental health needs \noften end up in police custody instead of getting the help they need. In contrast the NHS is expected to \nhelp those with other on-going (or even \"untreatable\") conditions, like diabetes or a heart condition. A \ncrisis for them may result in fast transit to A&amp;E, but not a trip to police cells and that's what needs to \nchange.\nSo, if most of the levers are outside the hands of the police, how can a Police &amp; Crime Commissioner make \na real impact\n?\nFor me, it comes down to three\n key approaches\n:\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA victim-based \"public health\" approach to crime\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA passionate commitment to an evidence-based approach\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA partnership approach to prevention\nHere's what they mean in practice:\nA victim-based approachWhen the Justice Select Committee enquired into the needs of victims, I asked the then Chief Executive of \nVictim Support to summarise what victims want and need. She answered that what victims want, more \nthan anything else (other than not to have become a victim in the first place) is to know that it's not going \nto happen again.\nWe need to make sure that victims are treated properly within the criminal justice system. Going to court \nis too often an experience of re-victimisation, and that must change. But it is also imperative that we \nprevent offending, re-offending and re-victimisation .\nThe police role is vital - not on their own, but as part of the team with other agencies. Victims need to see \nthe police as being \"on their side\" and I strongly support my Chief Constable's commitment to improving \nthe satisfaction of victims with the police response to crime and anti-social behaviour.\nRestorative justice too must be victim-centred, enabling the victim's voice to be heard while challenging \nthe offender and tackling the \"relational deficit\" which is exhibited by so many offenders.\nEvidence-based approachPreparing evidence for the court is central to police professionalism, so it may seem redundant to demand an evidence-based approach to policing. But an evidence-based approach to crime reduction i\ns different,\n and for a time was not seen as central to the police as a \"blue light\" service. The \"blue light service\" of \nreactive policing is essential to the public and central to the role of the police - but it's \nreactive rather than \npreventative.&#xa0;\nThe \"can do\" attitude of the police to tackling problems is a great strength. When a problem arises, their \ninstinctive response is \"let me take that away and sort it\". —However this can be a weakness if the levers of \npreventative action lie with other people. So the big challenge for a Commissioner is to endorse the \naction-orientated approach while leading the search for \"what works\" and taking a clinical approach to \nasking \"why does this bad stuff happen?\" and bringing about change.\nMy passionate belief in the partnership approach comes from a history of working across different \nagencies long before I entered Parliament. I worked with young offenders, I sought to reduce offending \nlocally, I worked in an analytic interagency context as a youth worker and I chaired the city's Juvenile \nBench (as it then was). An \"action research\" project in the Ely area of Cardiff with a young researcher —\nnow Prof Howard Williamson of the University of South Wales made a massive impact on me. Intensive \nwork proved that people in different professions \"knew\" the area in general, but totally misunderstood the \ndetail at the granular local level. It also proved that a silo approach by agencies and professions is not just \nineffective but totally counter-productive.\nEarlier, being involved in a major project on \"Working Together for Children and their Families\", led by the \nlate great Barbara Kahan, opened my eyes to the ineffectiveness of a great deal of public policy.\nWe now have ample proof that an evidence-based approach to partnership works. The Crime and Disorder \nReduction Partnerships required by the 1998 Act (Community Safety Partnerships in Wales) are a clear \nsuccess, although the methodology of audit, evidence collection and analysis has not been as methodical \nas I intended.\nThe effectiveness of a rigorous approach is shown by the Cardiff Violence Reduction Programme led by \nProf Jonathan Shepherd of Cardiff University's Medical School. Jonathan approached me in the mid-90s to \nargue that a scientific approach could cut violence significantly. His in-tray for treatment of facial injuries \nfrom car accidents was going down (in number and seriousness) but his in-tray of victims of violence was escalating.\nIt's a long story, but analysing incidents which brought victims of violence to A&amp;E led to significant and \nsustained reductions in the number and seriousness of violent incidents. Peer-reviewed published \nevidence puts this beyond doubt. A crucial aspect of my Police and Crime Plan, supported by the Welsh \nHealth Minister, Mark Drakeford AM, is to take a similar baseline approach to all Accident and Emergency \nDepartments across South Wales.\nCommitment to partnership and preventative approaches So an analytic approach is vital and partnership works - provided partnership is much more than different \nprofessionals just feeling comfortable with each other. I am convinced that other aspects of crime will \nrespond to a similar clinical and rigorous approach. That's why partnership needs to permeate all agencies \nand translate into activity on the ground — as happens in the late night triage in Cardiff where health, \npolice, local authority and Third Sector staff work amazingly well together.\nThe benefits are obvious and borne out in the statistics: If police have fewer crimes to deal with, they can \nfocus their limited resources on improving interventions, increasing the sanction-detection levels, \nimproving victim satisfaction and improving engagement with the wider public. That's consistent with Sir Robert Peel's messages. It's good for a surgeon to have fewer cases in his in-tray, for courts to deal with \nfewer cases and subsequently for police officers to be s\npared wasteful hours in court ……. \nand it's good\n for those who do not become victims.\n&#xa0;\nI can only speak for South Wales, where the police have pursued this approach for several years and we \nhave the enthusiastic engagement of local councils and others. The 2010 Comprehensive Spending \nReview's severe cuts, compounded now by further cuts, puts this success at risk. Above all, we need to \navoid what I saw in previous recessions when many agencies retreated into their silo, narrowed their focus \nand reduced interagency cooperation. Certainly in Wales there is good evidence that things are different \nthis time : Welsh Government, local councils and others understand that in tough times you need more \njoint working, not less.\nThat's where the Police and Crime Commissioner can add value.\nIf many crime reduction levers are outside the hands of the police, are the police less important as a Force \nand as a Profession? Certainly not\n: The role of police officers is enormously complex, coping with an \namazing range of demands from local antisocial behaviour to terrorism and extremism, from traffic to the \nnight time economy, from helping vulnerable elderly people to tackling thugs and crooks, and much, much \nmore. Clear operational direction by the chief constable is vital, complemented by the role of the\n \nindividual police officer - a citizen to whom we have given powers to act on behalf of the rest of us.\nMinisterial statements and Media headlines about Police and Crime Commissioners talked of \"powers\" and \n\"holding chief constables to account\". That's important, but any interested observer should study the \"Commissioners Oath of Office\". An MP's oath refers vaguely to serving the Queen as some sort of proxy \nfor public service, whereas the Commissioner's Oath is detailed, complex and specific. It reflects the \ncomplex role of a Commissioner, which in turn reflects the complex role of the police and I have promised \nspecifically to serve the people and communities of South Wales.\nThe formal duties of a Commissioner are important, but it's the \"and Crime\" part of the role that allows an imaginative and enthusiastic Commissioner to make a real impact as a real partner for the Chief Constable, \nmutually challenging but with clear areas of responsibility. The Commissioner can make the connections \nacross public bodies in general and carry out the explicit duty to provide an \"efficient and effective criminal \njustice system\" in the local police area. Our leadership is about driving down crime \nand supporting \nexcellence in policing.\nThe way forward is clear — it's through a \"public health\" approach to policing. The Media portray well the \nexcitement of \"blue light\" activities in the NHS and in the police, but it's the hidden, painstaking, evidence-based approach to making things better that matter for victims and patients. To put it another way, fewer \nvictims and fewer patient spells success.\nThere's just one problem.\nFor years I believed that cutting crime would lead to people feeling safer, but that's not how it works. \nWhen I ask public meetings whether the centre of Cardiff is safer or less safe than it was ten years ago, \nmost people say \"worse\". In fact it's far safer — shown by the reduced number and seriousness of injuries \nthat take victims of violence to A&amp;E.\nSo I want to add a \"\nTenth Principle\" to Peel's nine\n:\n&#xa0;\n\"We must understand the real levels of crime, not just what is reported, and share this knowledge with the public to reduce the fear of crime\".&#xa0;\nAs newspapers struggle to survive, as aspects of social media become shrill and intolerant, and as the \ncacophony of public opinion becomes ever more deafening, it sometimes seems hopeless to argue for \ntrusting the public with the facts. Local residents are a part of the solution, rather than part of the problem. \nChurchill described democracy as the worst form of government, except for all the others that have been \ntried. That applies equally to the public health approach to cutting crime and disorder.\nIt won't make headlines, but having been given leadership responsibility by the electorate, that's the direction in which the Police and Crime Commissioner should lead the police and the public.Rt Hon Alun Michael7th September 2013&#xa0;\n"
