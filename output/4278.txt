[[[ederation (FDF)]]]&#xa0;This written evidence is submitted by the Food and Drink Federation, the trade association for food and drink manufacturing. Food and drink is the largest manufacturing sector in the UK (accounting for 15% of the total manufacturing sector) turning over £78.7bn per annum; creating GVA of £20bn and employing up to 400,000 people.&#xa0;

[[[Executive Summary]]]&#xa0;Food security is fundamental, not only to individual well-being but to all wider human social and economic activity. It is also an extremely complex issue dependent on many different factors and variables. UK food security cannot be seen in isolation from what is happening elsewhere in the world. But, as the Committee recognised in its 2009 inquiry, there is potential for us to do more at a national level to address the challenges which have since been comprehensively articulated in the Final Report of the Government Office for Science Foresight Global Food and Farming Futures Project published in January 2011.&#xa0;In essence these challenges involve producing more, from less and with less impact against a background of world population growth, increased pressure on natural resources and the need to mitigate and adapt to climate change.&#xa0;Other contributory drivers such as increasing urbanisation, demand for higher protein diets in developing countries and the apparently more frequent incidence of extreme weather events, notably droughts and floods, are widely recognised as reinforcing the need for greater resilience and sustainability across the whole food system, in terms of both production and consumption.&#xa0;Food and drink manufacturing plays an essential role in driving resource efficiency and supplying consumers with a wide range of safe, nutritious, appetising and affordable products, as well as contributing to economic growth and supporting rural and other communities by offering many different employment opportunities.&#xa0;But improvements are needed at all stages of production, from the raw materials we source, to the energy, water and other resources we use in processing, through to helping consumers in the choices they make.&#xa0;Science and technology have the potential to make a major contribution to the innovation required to make food which is healthier, more sustainable and more affordable for everyone.

[[[The UK Food and Drink Manufacturing Industry]]]&#xa0;The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) represents the food and drink manufacturing industry, the largest manufacturing sector in the UK, employing 400,000 people.&#xa0; The industry has an annual turnover of over £78.7bn accounting for 15% of the total manufacturing sector. Exports amount to over £12bn of which 76% goes to EU members. The industry buys two-thirds of all UK’s agricultural produce.&#xa0;The following Associations actively work with the Food and Drink Federation:&#xa0;ABIM              Association of Bakery Ingredient ManufacturersACFM              Association of Cereal Food ManufacturersBCA              British Coffee AssociationBOBMA              British Oats and Barley Millers AssociationBSIA              British Starch Industry AssociationBSNA              British Specialist Nutrition AssociationCIMA              Cereal Ingredient Manufacturers’ AssociationEMMA              European Malt Product Manufacturers’ AssociationFCPPA              Frozen and Chilled Potato Processors AssociationFOB              Federation of BakersPPA              Potato Processors AssociationSMA              Salt Manufacturers’ AssociationSN              Sugar Nutrition UKSNACMA              Snack, Nut and Crisp Manufacturers’ AssociationSPA              Soya Protein AssociationSSA              Seasoning and Spice AssociationUKAMBY              UK Association of Manufacturers of Bakers’ YeastUKHIA              UK Herbal Infusions AssociationUKTC              UK Tea Council&#xa0;&#xa0;FDF also runs specialist sector groups for members:&#xa0;BCCC              Biscuit, Cake, Chocolate and Confectionery GroupFF              Frozen Food GroupMG              Meat GroupORG              Organic GroupSG              Seafood Group&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
