[normal]P Chadwick – Written evidence[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]As a member of the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance (YDGLA) I am writing to say that I would very much like the new legislation to include wording / provision to cut out the huge amount of time and energy 
[normal]spent  dealing
[normal] with spurious claims by 4x4 recreational traffic users for rights over unsealed county roads and tracks, usually based on fairly flimsy evidence which has to be looked into and found wanting.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This would help protect the countryside and the majority of users including walkers, cyclists and horse-riders.  I 
[normal]support  the
[normal] submissions of the Green Lanes Environmental Action Group (GLEAM), the Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG), the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA) and  of the course the YDGLA.  I understand they are preparing:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.  That all unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic, and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs) should be recognised as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be re-classified as Restricted Byways.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]and
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. When a local authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order that is widely-supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector, or a magistrate. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am writing this from a personal experience as a land owner at Bordley, near Skipton in the Yorkshire Dales National Park.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Yours faithfully
[normal]&#xa0;
