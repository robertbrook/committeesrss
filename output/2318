defaultP Chadwick – Written evidencedefault&#xa0;
defaultAs a member of the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance (YDGLA) I am writing to say that I would very much like the new legislation to include wording / provision to cut out the huge amount of time and energy 
defaultspent  dealing
default with spurious claims by 4x4 recreational traffic users for rights over unsealed county roads and tracks, usually based on fairly flimsy evidence which has to be looked into and found wanting.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis would help protect the countryside and the majority of users including walkers, cyclists and horse-riders.  I 
defaultsupport  the
default submissions of the Green Lanes Environmental Action Group (GLEAM), the Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG), the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA) and  of the course the YDGLA.  I understand they are preparing:
default&#xa0;
default1.  That all unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic, and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs) should be recognised as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be re-classified as Restricted Byways.
default&#xa0;
defaultand
default&#xa0;
default2. When a local authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order that is widely-supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector, or a magistrate. 
default&#xa0;
defaultI am writing this from a personal experience as a land owner at Bordley, near Skipton in the Yorkshire Dales National Park.
default&#xa0;
defaultYours faithfully
