defaultWitnesses: 
defaultProfessor Helen Margettsdefault,

default, and 
defaultDdefaultr defaultBen Worthydefault, 
defaultLecturer in Politics at Birkbeck College, University of London
default, gave evidence
default.  
defaultQ1 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultFirst, may I apologise to you for the late-running of our Committee
default?  
defaultWe are very grateful to you for joining us.  This is our first session on open data.  
defaultC
defaultould
default you
default identify yourselves for the record, please
default?
defaultProfessor Margettsdefault:
default 
defaultI am Helen Margetts, Director of the Oxford Internet Institute.  
defaultDr Worthy:default 
defaultBenjamin Worthy
default, a lecturer in politics from Birkbeck College.  
defaultQ2 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultThank you very much for being with us.  
defaultMay 
defaultI suggest that
default,
default if you feel we are not asking the right questions
default,
default you give us the information you think we need in your answers so 
defaultthat 
defaultwe are educated?  
defaultCould each of you 
defaultjust 
defaultdescribe 
defaultto us what you think the term “open data”
default 
defaultactually 
defaultmeans?  
defaultProfessor Margetts:default 
default“
defaultOpen data
default”
default is an interesting term and it gets many terms bundled into it.  In some ways, open data is a bit like the little white bunny of 
defaultg
defaultovernment.  It means something nice, warm and good that will aid democracy.  It is a confused term
default,
default though
default,
default because it implies that it is just opening data up for public use.  In the loosest sense
default,
default that would be a term
default,
default 
defaultbut 
defaultsome people use 
defaultit 
defaultto mean open government; some people use it to mean big data
default—
defaultdata that can be used for a particular kind of analysis.  
defaultThe confusion comes from the fact that it basically has three aims
default,
default and you will see all these aims mentioned by different people
default—
defaultand even the same people.  
defaultThey are: greater transparency; 
defaultimproving 
defaultg
defaultovernment
default, as 
defaultsomehow open 
defaultdata 
defaultwill make 
defaultg
defaultovernment better
default; 
defaultand 
defaultencourag
defaulting
default innovation and enterprise in the wider commercial world.  That is where the confusion comes from.  
defaultDr Worthy:default You have Rufus Pollock from the Open Knowledge Foundation 
defaultspeaking 
defaultlater.  
defaultIt has 
defaulta very good definition of open data: information that is reusable
default and accessible to all, 
defaultand can be read by a machine.  That is a very simple definition.  Helen is exactly right in what she says.  T
defaulthe problem is that it is conflated with lots of other ideas
default and there 
defaultis an assumption that open data means open government, for example.  
defaultThere are quite a lot of assumptions built into an idea like 
defaultthat—
defaultthat open data then automatically leads to transparency and accountability of 
defaultg
defaultovernment.  
defaultQ3 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default What is the difference between open data and open government?  
defaultDr Worthy:default 
defaultOpen 
defaultdata is about technology and
default making something machine
default&#x2011;
defaultreadable.  Open 
defaultgovernment brings in more political ideas about making government accountable and answerable.  
defaultFor example, 
defaultf
defaultreedom of 
defaulti
defaultnformation is about accessing information.  Open data is about re-using information and doing interesting and new things with it to gain new understandings.  
defaultThere is considerable overlap there, but they are not necessarily the same thing
default, not least because the Government can control what open data is given out.  
defaultQ4 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default How well does each of you think the Government understands this?  
defaultProfessor Margetts:default Not very well.  
defaultQ5 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultThank you.  
defaultWhy was that so hard to say?  
defaultProfessor Margetts:default 
defaultFor the reason I 
defaultgave
default.  To criticise open data is a bit like saying you do not like babies: you are not supposed to say it.  It is true that it has very noble aims
default,
default and most of the people who are great advocates of open data have the three noble aims that I mentioned.  The point is that there is an idea that open data will somehow automatically lead to open government
default,
default and that is by no means the case.  
defaultQ6 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultDr Worthy, d
defaulto you think in 
defaultg
defaultovernment there is a sense that they just need to be in favour of it and it 
defaultall 
defaultwill happen, whatever 
default“
defaultit
default”
default is?  
defaultDr Worthy:default 
defaultIt is a bit like the idea of transparency.  Transparency is just a good thing in all situations
default,
default and it is so deeply embedded as a good thing that it is difficult to argue about the nuances.  
defaultWhat Helen says is exactly right.  There are so many aims attached to open data.  
defaultThere are economic aims about hunting down waste and encouraging use by business.  
defaultThere are political aims about participation and transparency.  
defaultThere are social aims about empowering communities.  There are so many
default,
default and one of the things I have been finding in my interviews is that local government, from its perspective, 
defaultfinds that central Government 
defaultare 
defaultswitching between different aims and 
defaultshifting 
defaultthe 
defaultemphasis.  
defaultThey are not exactly sure what it is they are supposed to see, whom they are supposed to be targeting with this data and what effects should be coming out of it.  
defaultQ7 default&#xa0; 
defaultKelvin defaultHopkinsdefault:default 
defaultYou implied that open data means open government, but open data has to have a licence
default,
default as I understand
default it,
default and there is also closed data.  
defaultThe Government can choose if things are open or closed.  
defaultIs that right?  
defaultDr Worthy:default Yes.  
defaultProfessor Margetts:default Yes, Government Departments have to release data, but they can 
defaultto a large extent 
defaultchoose 
defaultwhich data to release and which data not to release.  T
defaulthey cannot release 
defaultsome data 
defaultbecause it is personal data
default or 
defaultif 
defaultthere would be strong ethical or legal barriers to them doing so.  
defaultDr Worthy:default 
defaultThat is one of the fundamental differences to bear in mind between open data and open government.  If you compare open data with f
defaultreedom of information, open data is 
defaultstill 
defaultwhat 
defaultthe 
defaultG
defaultovernment choose
default to release
default or emphasise.  With freedom of information
default,
default you can ask for many different things, some of which 
defaultthe Government probably do
default not necessarily want you to ask for.  
defaultThere is more of a sense that the Government cannot control 
defaultexactly 
defaultwhat has been asked for
default with FOI
default.  
defaultThere is a distinction.  
defaultQ8 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultIf a graduate brought to you the 
defaulto
defaultpen 
defaultd
defaultata White Paper as a piece of work, what sort of marks would you give it?  
defaultProfessor Margetts:default I would give it quite good marks as a plan for what 
defaultyou are going to do
default but, in a way, 
defaultI would find it very difficult to mark
default,
default because we do not have enough data about the data.  I think I would be asking for a 
defaultviva
default.
defaultDr Worthy:default My first comment would be a comment I often put in essays
default: 
defaultneeds mo
defaultre focus
default.  It needs a stronger line of argument to tell me what exactly the aims are
default,
default and more evidence to tell me what is going to happen and why.  
defaultQ9 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default What marks would you give the Shakespeare 
defaultr
defaulteview?  
defaultProfessor Margetts:default I think the same.  It was good, but both these things 
defaultare lacking feedback loops that would somehow make these things happen.  It is no good just putting data out there and somehow thinking it will float off into the stratosphere, make things better and achieve these three aims.  You need some mechanism for evaluating whether that is happening.  That is what is so difficult.  We are trying to do some of that at the Oxford Internet Institute.  We are doing a systematic analysis of the data.gov platform, but some of the 
defaultinformation you need just is not there.  
defaultDr Worthy:default There are some very interesting id
defaulteas in the Shakespear
defaulte 
defaultr
defaulteview. 
default 
defaultThere is 
defaultthe need for a more coherent strategy
default,
default 
defaultwith its emphasis on citizens as users
default,
default and the need for a feedback loop is very important.  I have mainly been working with local government
default,
default and one of the
defaultir
default points 
defaultis they 
defaultwant 
defaultto see what is in it for them
default in terms of public authorities.  A lot of the talk is about what will happen for citizens, businesses and others.  
defaultA 
defaultselling point being missed
default 
defaultis how this 
defaultsort of 
defaultdata could 
defaultreally transform 
defaulthow policies are made and 
defaultresources are 
defaultallocated.  
defaultIf you could develop applications that traced down to the street level how money is spent
default,
default that could make a huge difference to how a local authority makes policy
default and 
defaultdecisions
default,
default and how it allocates resources.  Homelessness is one area that springs to mind.  
defaultThe 
defaultGovernment 
defaultprobably 
defaultneed
default to sell more strongly what is in it for a public authority
default,
default as well as helping the public and other groups.
default  
defaultQ10 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultT
defaulthe Gove
defaultrnment need
default to have a clearer idea of what 
defaultthey are 
defaultattempting to achieve by open data.  
defaultIs that it?  
defaultProfessor Margetts:default 
defaultYes.  I do
default not
default know if you have looked at the data, but it is not immediately citizen-friendly.  
defaultQ11 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultI was going to come on to the quality of the data.  
defaultWhat do you feel about the quality of the data 
defaultthat is being 
defaultreleased
default?  
default 
defaultProfessor Margetts:default 
defaultIt would not be very easy for the average citizen to use the actual data sets.  
default              defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultIt is
default 
defaultvery 
defaultinaccessible.  
defaultProfessor Margetts:default  
defaultThat is going to 
defaultdepend
default on the development of applications that allow citizens to do something with it.  Data is lacking, but of 
defaultthe 300 applications that are mentioned on the site
default,
default I think only 20 of them are 
defaultregistered with iTunes.  That is all we can find.  
defaultQ12 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultHow applicable do you think 
defaultthe 
defaultterm “data dumping” is?  How comfortable do you feel with that epithet being applied to the Government?  
defaultProfessor Margetts:default I would say it is not quite fair.  
defaultChairdefault:default Some people say that, don’t they?  
defaultProfessor Margetts:default Yes, 
defaultthere is a danger
default,
default but it is difficult to generalise.  There are 14,000 data sets on the platform, so that is a lot of data sets.  They are tremendously variable in their usefulness and in the extent to which they are being used, but it is difficult to say because we do not have that level of data about the individual data sets.  
defaultQ13 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default Can you summarise what 
defaultthree things they need to 
defaultdo 
defaultto improve the quality of the data?  
defaultProfessor Margetts:default 
defaultT
defaulto start with
default,
default if they want 
defaultthem 
defaultto be used 
defaultby c
defaultit
defaultizens
default,
default they will have to be citizen-
defaultfocus
defaulted
default applications rather than developer-
defaultfocus
defaulted
default.  
defaultQ14 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultWho will develop these applications?  
defaultProfessor Margetts:default 
defaultThat is the thing.  They need to be incentivised to do it if they are going to be citizen-
defaultfocus
defaulted
default as opposed to geared at making money or whatever.  
defaultQ15 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultIs t
defaulthe expectation that people out there are going to start deve
defaultloping applications a little nai
defaultve
default?  How confident are you that applications will be developed on the basis of the Government’s present strategy?  
defaultProfessor Margetts:default Commercial use will be made of quite a lot of this data, but there is no 
defaultparticular 
defaultincentive
default for the developers who do it to say that they are using the data
default—
defaultthey can certificate it
default, etc.
default, but why 
defaultwould they?  They might as well just use it
default,
default because it is like a free good.  
defaultSecondly, the incentive is going to be to make money out of it
default,
default rather than 
defaultto 
defaultdo things for citizens.  
defaultDr Worthy:default To give you three: it needs to be contextualised; it needs to be comparabl
defaulte; 
defaultand, 
defaultto an extent
default,
default it needs to have a narrative, 
defaultas was mentioned in
default a number of 
defaultmy 
defaultinterviews
default. 
default Even data needs to tell some sort of story.  
defaultPeople will innovate with this sort of information anyway
default,
default because that is just their nature.
defaultQ16 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default In the area of public policy
default,
default unless you have a Dr
default&#xa0;
defaultFoster or a 
defaultm
defaultySociety
default,
default the citizen is not going to be able to make any sense of this.  What does the Government need to do to generate those applications and those intermediaries?  
defaultProfessor Margetts:default It needs to encourage and incentivise intermediari
defaultes with a citizen 
defaultfocus
default to make that sort of aim explicit and to think of ways of incentivising NGOs to do it.  
defaultDr Worthy:default 
defaultP
defaulterhaps
default it needs
default to meet 
defaultthem 
defaulthalfway 
defaultby
default,
default to an extent
default,
default standardising i
defaultnformation.  
defaultLooking from local government level at the spending data, often it is just 
defaulta 
defaultlist of columns: the name of a company, the amount of money and the directorate that has given that money to it.  
defaultIt needs more there.  People at local government level are very interested
default in localised information and amenity.  The classics are council tax, amenities and services.  If they 
defaultcan do more in that 
defaultdirection
default—
defaultlink it to other information
default,
default bring it closer and make it easier to 
defaultinnovate with
default—
defaultthat might make a difference. 
default  
defaultProfessor Margetts:default 
defaultIn part it depends on what your aim is.  There would be different things to do for different aims.  This would be great, for example, if your aim were to make Government more 
defaulttransparent.  
defaultIf you want to make 
defaultg
defaultovernment better and improve it
default,
default 
defaultt
defaulthis may not be the right sort of data.  
defaultGovernment Departments hold 
defaultall 
defaultsorts of data
default as a result of their administrative operations that could be put to greater effect in making 
defaultg
defaultovernment better.  
defaultThat would not necessarily involve making it open.  It may not be possible to make it open.  It 
defaultmay be too personal; it may be ethically impossible to make it open.  It is 
defaultdata for different aims
default.
defaultQ17 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default Can we have an example?  
defaultFor example, p
defaultatient records and medical statistics 
defaultare 
defaultpersonal data, but in aggregate 
defaultare 
defaulthuge source
defaults
default of
default intelligence about how to improve public health
default,
default drugs and treatments.  
defaultHowever, that 
defaultinformation is not available to universities or 
defaultthe 
defaultresearch institutes of major companies.  Is that the sort of data you are talking about?  
defaultProfessor Margetts:default Yes, that is the sort of data I am talking about.  
defaultIt does not just have to be health
default; i
defaultt could be tax or benefits administration data.  
defaultQ18 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default How do we deal with that?  
defaultProfessor Margetts:default It may not be possible to make some of that data open, but we cannot necessarily expect open data to do the job
default of that data
default.  
defaultQ19 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultSo what we are in fact saying is that open data includes a collection of data that might not be open to the public but needs to be open to other users on a protected basis.  
defaultDr Worthy:default Yes, there is a halfway house for some data in 
defaultthat
default you can give it to people with certain limitations
default and commitments to use the data in a certain way.  
default 
defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultThat 
defaultwould be in the public interest.  
defaultDr Worthy:default 
defaultIt would depend on what the data was being used for and who was using it
default—
defaulta journalist or an innovator 
defaultwho is 
defaultusing this in some way
default.  That 
defaultcan be controlled.  
defaultThat is the halfway house between closed data and completely open data.  
defaultQ20 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reed:default 
defaultHow have open data initiatives transformed or changed public services?
defaultProfessor Margetts:default 
defaultThey have not
default,
default for some of the reasons we have been talking about
default,
default because of the lack
default of
default 
defaultfeedback loops.  
defaultIf one or more of these 14,000 data sets contained some really important information about the difference between contract providers, service providers or policing services, i
defaultt is not very clear what the feedback loops are for that information to get back to the Department that has produced the data.  
defaultIt is very much what Beth
default&#xa0;
defaultNoveck called “
defaultthrowing 
defaultdata over the transom”.  You throw it over
default,
default and then it floats off and it is good.  
defaultWithout the feedback loops
default,
default it would be very difficult to point to that.  
defaultQ21 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reed:default 
defaultT
defaulthere are no examples you can point to where this has made
default,
default or helped
default,
default a transformation happen.  
defaultDr Worthy:default There are examples locally where you could see
default it could have some potential.  
defaultMastodon C was one innovation that led to changes in medicines, for example.
defaultQ22 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reed:default What is it?  
defaultDr Worthy:default How much it costs to get particular medicines from 
defaultvarious 
defaultparts of the NHS.  You could 
defaultquickly search it and find that some places were paying much more for similar medicine.  You can 
defaultsee how that could have huge potential.  There was one 
defaultvery high profile example of citizen auditors taking on Barnet 
defaultc
defaultouncil because 
defaultit
default wanted to contract out a great deal of its services.  There are some examples.  Using one innovative website, Openly Local, which allows you to look at all sorts of different local council spending, on
defaulte journalist did a story on Southern Cross 
defaultand how much different councils paid
default.  
defaultYou can see these things
default,
default and Helen makes a really important point here
default:
default this information on its own will not make a difference
default; i
defaultt needs to be attached to accountability mechanisms.  
defaultFrom local government’s 
defaultview,
default you can see how open data could match with participatory 
defaultbudgeting, local referendums
default or 
defaultthe 
defaultincreased use of online consultation.  On its own
default,
default though, a bit like freedom of information, it does not just unleash a wave of accountability and feedback.  It needs political mechanisms into which it can feed and then be used.  
defaultQ23 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reed:default 
defaultComparative performance data would work as well.  
defaultAre there any examples of it increasing accountability in that way?  
defaultWhat examples are there of local public services or national public services moving in that direc
defaulttion?  There are a lot of small-
defaultscale initiatives that may not be being tied up yet.  It would 
defaultbe useful to know some of those.  
defaultProfessor Margetts:default 
defaultWe were talking just before we came in
default, and s
defaultome of the open data initiatives there have been
default,
default 
defaultlike crime data
default,
default 
defaulthave definitely got a lot of interest
default and a lot of people looking at them
default.  
defaultCrime data 
defaultis 
defaulthugely 
defaultused, but the 
defaultextent to which it is being used to feed
default 
defaultback into policin
defaultg services is much less clear
default,
default because people are maybe looking at crime data because they want to compare house prices with where they used to live, or where they might go, rather than it being fed back into public services.  
defaultDr Worthy:default The accountability 
defaultthat I foun
defaultd at local level seems to be quite low level or localised.  
defaultIt is on a particular 
defaultcontroversy about a 
defaultchief executive
default’s pay or
default use of money in a certain policy area.  It is often emphasised either by a hyper-local site or by local journalists
default,
default and there 
defaultmay be some use of 
defaultthis by local activists as well, but sometimes it is under the radar
default,
default as are a lot of things at local level.  
defaultQ24 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reed:default 
defaultIf there is not much of it happening, wh
defaultat are the main barriers to publishing more data in ways that are useable by citizens
default or others
default who have an interest?  
defaultProfessor Margetts:default 
defaultOne of the ways is the one I mentioned before
default—
defaultsome of the most useful data is actually personal data
default,
default or data that it would be very difficult to open up.  
defaultObviously
default,
default the incentive for Departments and agencies 
defaultis 
defaultto open up t
defaulthe data that is easy to open up
default and 
defaultthat they do not mind opening up, 
defaultrather than the data that is going to have a lot of barriers 
defaultto 
defaultthem so doing.  
defaultThat needs tackling head on.  
defaultDr Worthy:default I am in the middle of conducting a survey 
defaultof local authorities about 
defaultopen data
default,
default 
defaultand I asked them about some of the barriers.  One barrier is cultural.  It depends how the authority works and where open data could fit in in its mode of decision making.  
defaultI think it is about leadership.  
defaultWe talked at the beginning about the strategies that were not clear on exactly what was wanted.  
defaultSome leaders may see this as something that they should just minimally comply with.  There 
defaultis also an issue of resources.  Some local authorities are locked into particular contracts with technology and software, so they can only do certain things.  
defaultIt may 
defaultalso 
defaultbe an issue about skills
default: t
defaulto rea
defaultlly take advantage of this data, link it
default to other pieces of information; 
defaultand to help with innovations
default,
default you 
defaultneed particular skills
default that not all authorities or public bodies may have ready access to.  One solution is to make sure that public bodies do work closely with innovators who do have this level of skills.  
defaultQ25 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reed:default Do you recognise there would perhaps be a risk 
defaultthat 
defaultsome politicians would feel that
default,
default if you moved towards
default publishing data around street-level spend, as you mentioned earlier, that could create an impetus towards equalising spend per capita
default,
default rather than focusing spend on areas or households with greater levels of deprivation or social exclusion
default,
default who would be 
defaultgenerally less articulate
default?
defaultDr Worthy:default 
defaultLooking at local government especially, I have found that 
defaultalthough technology is 
defaultoften 
defaultpresented as a neutral good
default,
default it is extremely political.  
defaultThe local government spending data is very politicised.  It is about local versus central 
defaultG
defaultovernment.  Some interviewees have spoken of how they feel that the spending data is presented in a particular way to make it look like local authorities are profligate wasters of money.  
defaultRegarding t
defaulthe way in which you see it now
default,
default with the £500 spends
default,
default there are automatically words like “bar bills” and you see how much money
default was spent
default.  
defaultThe 
defaultway you present the data can frame what you think.  
defaultThere is much less information in their spend data about what impact the money has and much more about the fact that it has been spent, which biases you to understand spending in a particular way.  
defaultWhatever way you push it
default,
default there are risks that it can have all sorts of effects
default, not least because how people behave when 
defaultgiven 
defaultinformation is very nuanced and subjective.  It is 
defaultnot simply that they get 
defaulta 
defaultpiece of information and then do 
defaultX
default.  
defaultQ26 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reed:default 
defaultPushing the same point, h
defaultow do you overcome the f
defaultact that
default,
default if you did have street-
defaultlevel spend data
default,
default most people would 
defaultfind that less than average was spent
default on their household
default,
default 
defaultbecause 80% of public spending is 
defaultfocus
defaulted
default on 20% of households?  
defaultHow do you get 
defaultan 
defaultexplanation along with the data so 
defaultthat 
defaultit does not get misconstrued?  
defaultProfessor Margetts:default 
defaultI am just agreeing with you.  
defaultWhy would that particular data help to make public services better?  
defaultIt would not.  
defaultDr Worthy:default 
defaultThere is only a certain amount that you could do.  I think you could push out as much information as possible and as much context.  Like Helen said earlier, you could also have accountability and consultation mechanisms to try 
defaultto 
defaultequalise this.  I found the same problem with freedom of i
defaultnformation.  
defaultThere was a concern that you sent out an FOI answer and some Departments and 
defaultbodies tried to put as much context as possible into the 
defaultanswer 
defaultto explain 
defaultexactly what it meant.  Whether the person receiving the information read or believed that context is another issue; it is very difficult to know.  
default 
defaultQ27 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reed:default 
defaultCan I 
defaultimply from your responses there that you believe there is a limit to how far you think open data should go?  Is there some data 
defaultthat,
default if you publish it
default,
default will not help anyway and might cause a problem?  
defaultProfessor Margetts:default Yes, but with the 
defaultproviso that it might satisfy one of these three aims or principles
default,
default but n
defaultot necessarily the one that you were aiming 
defaultat satisfying.  
defaultYou have this dislocation between producers and consumers
default—
defaultsomebody is producing the data for somebody else rather than for their own 
defaultself-improvement
default.  
defaultQ28 default&#xa0; 
defaultKelvin defaultHopkinsdefault:default 
defaultI am very concerned about local
default authorities and how data 
defaultcan 
defaultbe used.  How could it be used to increase the understanding and 
defaultpublic 
defaultaccountability of public 
defaultservices
default?  
defaultDr Worthy:default 
defaultThe main thing that comes out very strongly from the research I have done up until 
defaultnow—it
default has been running for a 
defaultyear—
defaultis that it is all 
defaultabout the applications and innovations
default that people have made.  Very few people are going to go to their local authority website and look at the spending data, but many 
defaultpeople are very interested in 
defaultlocal 
defaultamenities and local services.  
defaultIf you look at applications like Openly Local, it allows you at the click of a button to look deeply into one authority’s spending or compare authority spending.  
defaultY
defaultou 
defaultcould also 
defaultlook at other applications I have mentioned in my evidence
default,
default like 
defaultAppGov
default, which is also 
defaultin preparation
default.  
defaultFirst
default,
default if you can make it easier to understand
default, 
defaultcontextualise it and
default link it to other information 
defaultand, secondly, if you can make it easier to access and understand
default,
default 
defaultthat 
defaultcan make a real difference.  
defaultAmerica
default is a good example here.  There are lots of very interesting and radical experiments 
defaultat the city level in 
defaultAmerica
default,
default where they have joined up contact centres with 
defaultthe 
defaultreal-time online ability to report problems and things, which 
defaultis 
defaultlinked in to service data.  
defaultQ29 default&#xa0; 
defaultKelvin defaultHopkinsdefault:default Ensuring data is consistent and harmonised across local authorities is crucial to 
defaultmaking 
defaultcomparisons.  
defaultWe have seen problems in the last few days in 
defaultBirmingham
default,
default with a desperate shortage of social workers
default—
defaultthey have 
defaultadmitt
defaulted
default they 
defaultcannot cope
default—
defaultand there are other local authorities doing well.  
defaultIt
default should not get to that st
defaultage.  I
defaultf we had good data and good comparisons between local authorities
default,
default p
defaulterhaps we could intervene at an earlier stage
default and make sure these things do not happen
default.  
defaultIs that not what some of the data should be for?  
defaultDr Worthy:default 
defaultAbsolutely.  You could imagine that you could have an application that could measure the 
defaultnumber 
defaultof hours social workers are spending on average with different people in different Departments.  
defaultIt could work as an early warning system for this sort of issue.  The problem is that these are also very political issues about social care.  
defaultYou may have seen last week that Eric Pickles talked about publishing comparative car parking data for local authorities to see how much money local authorities made from car parking.  It seems quite innocent, but of course it is a very political issue.  If you spend a lot of time around local government, car parking is huge
default,
default and you could see how this could go in particular ways.  You are exactly right
default,
default though
default,
default that that is how it could work.  
defaultQ30 default&#xa0; 
defaultKelvin defaultHopkinsdefault:default It strikes me that the abolition of the Audit Commission was not good because the 
defaultc
defaultommission has done a lot of this 
defaultkind of 
defaultwork.  
defaultLeaving local authorities to their own devices more
default,
default and perhaps even encouraging them to contract out
default, makes it
default perhaps more difficult to compare.  
defaultIs it possible that 
defaultG
defaultovernments 
defaultof 
defaulteither colour might not
default like some of this data
default?
default 
default It could
default, for example, show that where you have direct services rather than contracted out services
default,
default the direct services are more efficient, produce a better service and are more accountable
default.
default  The flavour of the last two Governments was that they wanted to get as much out into the private sector
default—
defaultinto contracting
default—
defaultas possible.  
defaultDr Worthy:default Th
defaultat
default is exactly the point
default:
default even though this open data looks neutral
default,
default it has 
defaultvery 
defaultpolitical implications.  
defaultOne of the concerns I have been finding in my research is actually the opposite.  The concern is that by publishing all this data about public service performance
default,
default you are handing potential 
defaultammunition to private providers who do not have to provide that 
defaultsort 
defaultof information
default.  It enables them to point at particular public services and say, “Look how expensive 
defaultX 
defaultis.  Look how wasteful 
defaultY
default 
defaultis
default.”
default  It is a very easy thing to do, so there is a concern
default. 
default Helen spoke about a piece of research that described it as a 
defaultpotential Trojan horse
default for further privatisation
default.  
defaultQ31 default&#xa0; 
defaultKelvin defaultHopkinsdefault:default 
defaultWould it not be sensible for 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment to require the private companies to provide the same information that local authorities are required to provide?  We could have genuinely open data across the board.  
defaultDr Worthy:default Absolutely.  
defaultQ32 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default Excellent.  That has been very informative.  Is there anything you want to add?  
defaultProfessor Margetts:default You are going to be doing a lot more questioning and you are going to be talking to
default—
default              
defaultQ33 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default Tel
defaultl us what we should be asking our other witnesses.  
defaultProfessor Margetts:default 
defaultYou should ask them about providing more 
defaultdata about what is happening to the data
default,
default and feedback loops between the producers of the data and the users of the data, so that the data gets better.  
defaultQ34 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default Do you think the punter
default or 
defaultthe
default ordinary member of the public
default—
defaultone has to be careful about how one says that because there is no such thing
default—
defaultwants 
defaultmore data that is specific 
defaultto the question they are asking, 
defaultor that gives a picture, story or narrative about the subject they are looking at?  
defaultWhat do you think we really want?  Is it just about the 
defaultd
defaulteath rate in my hospital for patients concerning heart disease
default,
default or do I want to understand what that means in the context of all hospitals, all death rates and all heart disease throughout the country?  Is data meaningful on its own
default without context
default?  
defaultSorry, I have asked about 10 questions.
defaultProfessor Margetts:default In an ideal world
default,
default 
defaultthe 
defaultidea would be that you have some kind of intelligence centre that can put this data together and produce conclusions from the data as a whole
default,
default rather than individual data sets released by individual health trusts and individual local authorities.  
defaultThe ideal
default—
defaultthe kind of thing that Tesco or Walmart has
default—
defaultis 
defaultsome kind of 
defaultintelligence centre
default using data from all the devolved bits of the organisation.  In an ideal world, 
defaultg
defaultovernment would be able to do that too.  
defaultDr Worthy:default 
defaultI have just a few thoughts very quickly.  Firstly, t
defaulthe politics of this thing is very important to bear in mind.  
defaultA lot of the discourse about technology is very deterministic
default— 
default“it is a good thing”
default 
default—
defaultand 
defaultperhaps 
defaulty
defaultou need to bear in mind the politics.  There are a lot of assumptions abo
defaultut how people behave when given
default information 
defaultor what people are interested in.  The discussion about context and localising information is important.  
defaultI would just like to emphasise how much potential there is here, particularly in the innovations that can be developed.  
defaultI teach a course about Parliament
default,
default and 
defaulta website like 
defaultTheyWorkForYou absolutely transforms
default how we can understand what Parliamentarians do.  Other developments like the Open Knowledge Foundation’s “Where Does My Money Go” have huge potential to transform our understanding of how money 
defaultis spent and what it is spent 
defaulton.  You need to bear in mind that there is huge potential to transform how services are delivered and how 
defaultthey 
defaultcan be 
defaultunderstood—
defaultif only the data and the technology 
defaultare 
defaultused and understood in the correct way.  
defaultQ35 default&#xa0; 
defaultKelvin defaultHopkinsdefault:default 
defaultJust to reinforce what the Chairman was saying about hospital death rates, there 
defaultwas a substantial debate on the radio last week
default,
default and 
defaultmany people challenged whether 
defaultthe particular statistic 
defaultthat is 
defaultused 
defaultto compare 
defaulthospitals
default had any validity at all
default,
default because all sorts of factors are not taken into account.  Is it important to put these qualifications in with the open data so that people do have a degree of caution 
defaultwhen they are looking at them?
defaultDr Worthy:default Absolutely.  
defaultQ36 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reed:default On that example you gave
default, I am a relatively new MP and I discovered that
default,
default on TheyWorkForYou
default,
default if you do two interventions in a debate
default,
default you get written up as having spoken in the debate, which is a tick, and it can take you half an hour.  You could spend a whole day visiting five different community organisations and get nothing.  Is that helping
default,
default or is it making MPs do things in order 
defaultto get ticks on that website
default that are not 
defaultnecessarily 
defaulthelping them represent their electors
default?
default 
default              defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultOr
default,
default indeed
default,
default you can sit all day in the Chamber hoping to be called, having spent hours working on your speech
default,
default and then you never get called.  
defaultDr Worthy:default There i
defaults an interesting question about what sort of information is displayed, and I know Tom Steinberg is going to speak next.  If you look at the research in 2011 on TheyWorkForYou
default,
default you do find, for example, 
defaultthat the site is attracting a huge number of people who previously said they were not engaged in politics.  
defaultIt does promote understanding, although what should be contained in there is obviously tied into the idea of what an MP should do, which is a huge i
defaultssue
default.
default              defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultThat is for 
defaultanother day.  Thank you very much indeed.  
defaultYou have been really helpful.  If you want to stay for the other evidence session we have now
default,
default that would be marvellous.  
defaultWitnesses: 
defaultTom Steinbergdefault, 
defaultDirector, M
defaulty
defaultSociety
default, 
defaultHeather Savorydefault, 
defaultChair, Open Data User Group
default,
default and 
defaultDr Rufus Pollockdefault, CEO, Open Knowledge Foundation
default, gave evidence
default.
defaultQ37 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultPlease
default identify yourselves for the
default record.  
defaultHeather Savorydefault: 
defaultI am Heather Savory and I 
defaultc
defaulthair the Government’s Open Data User Group.  
defaultQ38 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultCan you just remind us what the Open Data 
defaultU
defaultser Group is?  
defaultHeather Savorydefault: We are an independent advisory body to Government.  Members are 
defaultappointed by 
defaultme
default and
default the 
defaultMinister for the 
defaultCabinet Office.  The members are a
defaultll volunteers and come from all areas of the data community.  
defaultQ39 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default 
defaultY
defaultou bring a particular perspective, being a formal career civil servant.  
defaultHeather Savorydefault: My background is that I used to be in
default 
defaulth
defaultigh 
defaulttech
default,
default and then I did various other things.  I am not a career civil servant, but I had two years in Treasury and three years in 
defaultthe Department for Business, Innovation and Skills
default.  
defaultTom Steinbergdefault: I am Tom Steinberg; 
defaultI am the Director of 
defaultm
defaultySociety
default.  
defaultDr Pollock:default 
defaultI am Dr Rufus Pollock.  I am CEO of the Open Knowledge Foundation, which is a non-profit promoting access to information and its use to improve the world.  
defaultQ40 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default Each of you 
defaultis
default very interested in the open data agenda.  For each of you 
defaultand the people you represent
default,
default 
defaultthis could be a really big thing.  
defaultDr Pollock:default Yes.  
defaultChairdefault:default How much do you feel the Government 
defaulthave 
defaultreally gripped this agenda and 
defaultare 
defaulttaking it forward in the way that you wish?  
defaultDr Pollock:default 
defaultOur first point is that the Government here in the 
defaultUK
default 
defaulthave 
defaultbeen a leader globally in this agenda.  This Government and even the previous Government took serious steps to open up information and
default,
default to some extent
default,
default set policy.  There are some obvious lacunae in that, but on the whole I think the Government 
defaulthave 
defaultbeen leading.  There is a question at the present time
default—
defaultwe do not want the Government to rest on 
defaulttheir 
defaultlaurels.  While there have been some very good achievements, there is still much to be done.  
defaultMost fundamentally
default,
default one of the big
default lacks
default—
defaultTom was on
default,
default and I am still on
default,
default the Transparency Board
default—
defaultis the challenge you see in many countries with open data agendas
default:
default it still depends in some sense on 
defaultE
defaultxecutive whim, to put it in its most blunt sense.  
defaultIf the 
defaultPrime Minister or the 
defaultrelevant Minister 
defaultwere to decide they were no longer interested in this
default,
default there is no embedding of this agenda in legislation beyond what exists 
defaultin FOI or things like that.  
defaultOne of the greatest challenges is the certainty and the fact that, for example, you do not have this embedded in procurement rules.  You do not have
default it whenever the Government buy
default a new IT system or every time 
defaultthey decide
default to outsource a service.  It should still be the case that relevant data is still controlled by the Government.  One of the biggest risks and dangers we have seen evidence of both in the 
defaultUS
default and here is 
defaultthat 
defaultyou outsource some service 
defaultand
default,
default 
defaultbam
default,
default 
defaultall your information is gone.  One example has been train timetables, where one of the challenges has been whether the Government actually 
defaultcontrol
default 
defaulttrain 
defaulttimetables anymore
default,
default because obviously there are now private 
defaulttrain-
defaultoperating companies
default.  Y
defaultou might think that train timetables are a fundamental piece of Government information or institutional information.  
defaultThere 
defaulthas been 
defaultsome very significant progress
default,
default and the amou
defaultnt of data the 
defaultUK
default Government have
default released has been quite impressive and it is probably up there with any other Government in the world.  However, there 
defaultare some things missing in the strategy 
defaultand 
defaultthe policy.  
defaultMost fundamentally, that is the embedding of this agenda in something that you can be guaranteed will live on.  
defaultObviously,
default 
defaultyou can never guarantee 
defaultlegislation 
defaultwill 
defaultnot be reversed, but 
defaultthere could be
default greater certainty that it does not depend on the current set of Ministers.  
defaultHeather Savorydefault: I am 
defaultthe new girl on the block because I came to this agenda about one year ago.  I have to say that 
defaultI do not have all the history, but I think that the Government 
defaultare 
defaultdoing quite well.  
defaultThe problem is that what we see, and what the Open Data User Group is here to do, is the mismatch between th
defaulte data sets the Government want
default to put out and the 
defaultones that
default have the most economic benefit.  
defaultIn the year that I have been on this 
defaultagenda,
default we have seen some quite good improvements in the use of open data by the public sector.  The 
defaultarea which I think we really need to focus on 
defaultmoving 
defaultforward is to ease the commercial use of open data
default for the benefit of economic growth.  By that, I do not just mean start-ups and apps; I mean the whole of the digital economy, which has 
defaultconsiderable worth.  
defaultA
default report
default has
default just been commissioned 
defaultby Oxera that says this 
defaultmarket is going to be worth $270 billion 
defaultthis 
defaultyear and it grows at 30%.  
defaultI have a passion for the UK growth in technology
default,
default and open data is a fundamental underpinning component of the UK being able to do something in this space for growth
default—
defaultto grow some new companies and to help existing companies.  
defaultMy short answer is 
defaultthat 
defaultthe Government 
defaultare 
defaultdoing okay, but 
defaultthey 
defaultreally 
defaultneed
default to focus on the data sets
default,
default 
defaultand the fundamental core reference data that will underpin the value of those data sets
default,
default 
defaultto make them usable by the business community.  
defaultTom Steinbergdefault: We have 
defaulthad 
defaultan optimistic view and a neutral view, so I 
defaultmight as well be the 
defaultpessimistic view.  
defaultI think the Government 
defaulthave 
defaultnot 
defaultshown willingness to be serious about the economic benefit
default,
default or the public services reform and improvement benefit.  In fact, I feel that those of us
default—
defaultmyself included
default—
defaultwho represent this generation of people trying to reform Government are a pale shadow of my parents’ generation
default in the UK and
default,
default on the other side
default 
defaultof my family
default,
default my grandparents’ generation.  In both cases
default,
default there were some really substantial legislative changes out of the 
defaultUS
default and UK Governments in relation to the release of information.  We are nowhere 
defaultnear 
defaultthere 
defaultat 
defaultthis 
defaultpoint in time.  That is best shown by the fact that all the most economically significant data that Heather was alluding to before is still only made available in ways that seem highly likely to me to be sub-optimal for the economy, simply because releasing 
defaultit would be so politically painful and have 
defaultsome short-
defaultterm costs to 
defaulta 
defaultGovernment 
defaultwho do
default not have any money.  
defaultOn the political 
defaultside, 
defaultand the Government accountability, performance and service delivery side, which is where I have slightly more passion than the economic side, we 
defaulthave not seen any move forward 
defaultregarding
default the information 
defaultI can get 
defaultto find out if my local 
defaultcouncil 
defaultis
default conducting itself well, efficiently, or making terribly bad decisions that will affect me in my life.  I feel that 
defaultthe enthusiasm that has been shown has come from a pret
defaultty small part of the Government
default—
defaultbasically one or two Ministers
default—
defaultand the resistance from all the other 
defaultM
defaultinisters has essentially meant that this Government cannot be the same as Governments before
default,
default in the 
default’
default60s in America and in the 
default’
default90s in the UK
default,
default in terms of making meaningful legislative change of the kind that means we will see more substantial improvements come to this country in economic and political terms because of this agenda.  
defaultQ41 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default How much do you feel the Government 
defaulthave 
defaultnot set the right priorities in this programme?  What would be the right priorities?
defaultDr Pollock:default 
defaultPartially
default,
default to complement 
defaultTom
default—
default              
defaultChairdefault:default By all means debate with each other.  
defaultDr Pollock:default Tom
default is right to be harsh.  I think at the same time I 
defaultpossibly have a sense of the challenges 
defaultwe
default 
defaultmentioned.  
defaultUltimately, one is that we have existed in a period of austerity.  Frankly, one challenge has been 
defaultthe 
defaultTreasury.  Let’s be concrete.  The classic example is the postcode database, now interlocked with the privatisation of Royal Mail.  
defaultThere have been other key geographic data sets
default,
default and a lot of the barrier to some of 
defaultthis 
defaultvery important
default data
default, both 
defaultfor
default 
defaultaccountability purposes and commercially and economically, has been the fact that there is 
defaultsome “give up some jam today
default”—
defaultoften a very small amount of jam
default—“
defaultfor jam tomorrow”.
default  
defaultEssentially,
default you might have to put up £20 million, £10 million or £40
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion for what seem to be very significant anticipated benefits.  The sense is it has been a challenge within Government to make that case to some Departments.  Heather has done some sterling 
defaultwork but, for example, I do not think we have been totally successful on the postcode address 
defaultfile
default.  In a sense it has been quite a group of people
default—
defaultall the Transparency Board members, for example, including Sir Tim Berners-Lee
default—
defaultsaying 
defaultthat the Government should make that available
default.  It would have very significant benefits, but
default it
default has been a real challenge.  That is where it has been difficult
default,
default and Tom is right to say
default so
default.  
defaultAt the same
default time,
default I would say I have seen some Damascene 
defaultconversions
default among particular Ministers, in the sense of seeing the power of open data for them.  I noticed one of the questions was also about the 
defaultCivil Service
default or public sector seeing this.  I do not think we could say
default that every civil servant today suddenly sees this, but 
defaultI have seen certain Departments that have 
defaultbasically 
defaultgone from hostility to 
defaultthis idea to 
defaultsignificant 
defaultendorsement and seeing a value to them in terms of quality, public support and trust
default—
defaultand other things.  At the same 
defaulttime,
default it has been mixed.  
defaultI do not know if Tom might be more critical on this view.  
defaultHeather Savorydefault: 
defaultI just wanted to come in and say I support what Rufus is saying.  There is a 
defaultparticular issue with some of the
default trading funds.  That is because they are last century’s model.  They have essentially a funding model.  They are set up as bodies that are required to self-fund through commercial activity.  
defaultI was introduced to the four main trading funds
default here: Companies House, the Land Registry, Ordnance Survey and the Met Office.  
defaultI refer to 
defaultthem 
defaultas four non-identical twins.  
defaultThey are not all the same; they all do very different specialised work.  When you get under the skin of this, what you see is that the Land Registry has a very 
defaultgood
default, very proactive open data strategy.  We were able to persuade them to release the historic 
defaultprice-
defaultpaid data for housing and we have recently been able to persuade them to release something called the 
defaultINSPIRE database, which 
defaultis
default boundaries for properties.  The 
defaultMet Office has a good open data programme and Ordnance Survey also 
defaulthas a very successful open data programme, but it does not go far enough if you think about it in the wider economic terms 
defaultin which 
defaultwe should now be thinking about it.  
defaultThey have a funding model; the Treasury gets a small amount of return.  The 
defaultGovernment 
defaulthave 
defaultto pay for weather services
default and 
defaultfor geographic services.  These are esse
defaultntial components 
defaultof our society, and
default 
defaultalso 
defaultthere are 
defaultsecurity issues.  
defaultThere has to be a firm, underpinning set of data that we can operate the country on.  The model there needs to be revisited in terms of what the wider economic benefits are.  Rufus is right that there has been progress, but I think more needs to be done in some of those areas.  
defaultQ42 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default We are going to be writing a 
defaultr
defaulteport on the back of this 
defaulti
defaultnquiry
default 
defaultand we are able to make some recommendations.  
defaultCan you briefly say what you think our recommendations should be?  
defaultHeather Savorydefault: The absolute 
defaultfirst priority from the data community
default, but also
default,
default since I have been looking at it
default,
default for the wider economy, is an open n
defaultational 
defaultaddress data s
defaultet.  
defaultThere is a data set that is currently owned by GeoPlace, a joint venture between Ordnance Survey and local authorities, so that is in public ownership.  
defaultOur fundamental push has been to get this released as open data.  
defaultIt is essential.  
defaultIn the same way that the internet is the infrastructure of infrastructures in the virtual 
defaultand digital 
defaultworld
default, this geographic data is the infrastructure of infrastructures for everything else.  
defaultIf you think of energy being a core infrastructure
default,
default and
default it is
default—
defaultenergy 
defaultis core 
defaultto the 
defaultUK
default—
defaultto supply energy you need to know where it has to go and how it is going to get there.  If you do not know where you are 
defaultindividually,
default you do not know where you are going.  That is the absolute, fundamental key to open that up.  
defaultThat will 
defaultthen 
defaultunderpin deriving the value for
defaultm
default 
defaultthe very 
defaultmany other data sets
default that the Government holds in environment,
default transport, etc.
default,
default because it is 
defaultthe connective tissue, as Stephan Shakespeare calls it in his report
default, that enables you to put data sets together because you get a common identifier.  That is the absolute priority.  
default              defaultChairdefault:default Right, that is one recommendation.  
defaultTom Steinbergdefault: 
defaultThere are t
defaultwo things from me 
defaultthat 
defaultboth relate to the fact that the discussion in the last few years has been much too much about whether we can get this 
defaultor that data set out.  The laws that this Parliament passes do not ever tend to be about really specific things; they are not about one person or one company.  They tend to be about classes of companies and classes of people.  
defaultWe need two kinds of new law that do not exist at the moment.  One is about 
defaultg
defaultovernment procurement of computer systems
default that simply says all parts of 
defaultg
defaultovernment, whether large or small, must not or cannot procure anything digital or electronic of any kind that does not make the production of open data essentially available at zero marginal cost beyond the contract value
default.  
defaultThe reason that should be there is 
defaultbecause 
defaultit does not cost anything else.  
defaultIt is a bit like if you are building a brand new house and you want to make it easy for someone disabled to live in
default: 
defaultit 
defaultis incredibly cheap 
defaultto build it in at first compared 
defaultwith 
defaulttaking
default a building like this and try
defaulting
default to retrofit it.  
defaultQ43 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default What is your other recommendation?  
default              
defaultTom Steinbergdefault: 
defaultThe other one is about expanding the Freedom of Information Act so that people have similar powers to access data sets 
defaultto those 
defaultthey have to access paper documents.  
defaultQ44 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default Presumably 
defaultbeing able to access them electronically 
defaultwould make FOI much cheaper.  
defaultTom Steinbergdefault: It 
defaultcould do.  The procurement piece
default—
defaultthe first of the two pieces of legislation I mentioned
default—
defaultis what would really make it cheaper
default,
default because then if an officer or someone was 
defaultasked for 
defaultsome data by a citizen
default or
default a member of the public, it would be incredibly cheap
default and
default trivially easy when they had to go and get that information
default.  
defaultQ45 default&#xa0; 
defaultChairdefault:default Just finally on that
default, w
defaulthat is your recommendation or recommendations?    
defaultDr Pollock:default 
defaultThose are good.  
defaultThere are a couple of things that I would add.  
defaultOne is that you would like to have the principles set out that all non-personal data should be open by default.  
defaultHeather is doing a sterling job, but 
defaultit was rather interesting that she had to go to persuade the Land Registry to do this or persuade 
defaultX
default 
defaultto do that.  I
defaultt should be the case that t
defaulthere are exceptions to the rule and those have to 
defaultbe strongly justified
default on some grounds.  The point that Tom is getting at is that in theory things like that are in FOI, but they should be operationalised more effectively
default.  
defaultOften it is so costly to do this that we cannot do it, which 
defaultis 
defaultthe reason why we 
defaultwant the one-click button for open data in procurement rules.  
defaultThe 
defaultopen-by-
defaultdefault principle should be enunciated
default,
default and it should also be applied to the trading funds. 
default That
default is one of the primary things I would request.  
defaultThe other is that something be put into legislation for these things.  That is important.  
defaultI know this is subtle, but it is related to FOI
default,
default because a lot of it has gone into modifying FOI.  The one thing Tom did not mention is that w
defaulte also want to make sure that that data is made open.  If data is provided under FOI 
defaultor other stuff
default,
default it is automatically licensed under the open government licence.  
defaultOtherwise,
default there is this silly thing where you get the data
default,
default but you are not allowed to give it to anyone else without permission.  There is this weird thing where you get something under FOI and you are not allowed to give it to others, which is bizarre.  
defaultQ46 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reed:default 
defaultTom, j
defaultust on the point you raised
default 
defaultabout open data
default, 
defaultI used to be leader of a 
defaultc
defaultouncil before I was in here
default,
default and we implemented an 
defaultopen-
defaultby
default-
defaultdefault policy.  W
defaulthen we started putting the data out
default,
default people started coming back saying, “Great, but your data is in the wrong format
default.  We can’t use it
default.
default”
default 
default I
defaultt was a slow and expensive process to try 
defaultto 
defaultget that right.  What is the process for making sure the format is going to be useable as universally as possible
default?
defaultTom Steinbergdefault: 
defaultFirst
default, 
defaultI mentioned the need to put the requirement in procurement rules
default,
default because i
defaultf it is not in procurement rules 
defaultat all
default, 
defaultit is very 
defaultun
defaultlikely that the computer 
defaultsystem that you then 
defaultacquire will make it easy.  
defaultAfter it is written down 
defaulton 
defaultthe 
defaults
defaulttatute 
defaultb
defaultook, the structures needed to work out what standards are required are just general digital standards committees.  They are not the most exciting sounding things in the world, but there are 
defaultlots of them that basically make the internet work.  Very few of them are specifically British
default,
default because the question
defaults
default of how to send 
defaulta picture, an audio file, an e
default-
defaultmail or whatever are completely global issues.  In a very similar way, how I would release the single location of a bus stop is a completely global issue.  The standard for that particular thing I just mentioned largely came out of 
defaultAmerica
default, but is an internationally negotiated standard.  
defaultT
defaulthe good news for the Government is that you do not really have to set up anything.  
defaultYou do not have to go and say, “Now we need our own standards committees
default.
default”  Instead
default,
default all 
defaultyou do is find the people who are already working on the standards around parking places
default or whatever council information it is that people want, and you just participate in those.  At the end of it they will say, “This is the standard.  This is the one you should be using at the moment
default,
default” and then you make sure 
defaultany 
defaultnew computer system
default you buy
default is compliant with that.  You do not have to reinvent this wheel substantially yourself
default,
default because people all over the world are working on these common issues right now.  
defaultDr Pollock:default 
defaultT
defaulto add 
defaultjust 
defaultone thing to that, 
defaultthe definition of 
defaulto
defaultpen data at opendefinition.org does include machine-readability as a
default principle.  
defaultYou always have those stories in movies where the plucky defence are trying to sue this big company and they get given 500 box files of paper to read through.  There is a way to prevent the use of open data
default:
default by giving people material in a way they cannot process very easily.  Paper is not machine-readable.  A computer cannot read your handwriting very well yet, and all these kinds of things.  That is a requirement.  
defaultThe key thing to say is that once you have given out 
defaultsomething 
defaultmachine
default&#x2011;
defaultreadable
default—
defaultand by that I mean a spreadsheet versus a document with a table written on it
default—
defaultdo not get too worried about the format.  While geeks will complain
default and they will say, “You gave me Excel when you should have given me something else
default,
default” or whatever, in 
defaultgeneral once it is in that structure
default,
default people who are motivated enough will be able to use it
default or convert it
default.  
defaultThe one addendum to that is when you are missing some essential piece of information.  A classic example
default, which
default is where it gets more subtle at the moment
default, is that 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment give out very 
defaultdetailed 
defaultspending information
default now
default.  
defaultThey now give
default out contract information.  You might think you would like to put those two bits of data together more effectively.  Unfortunately, in the spending information
default,
default you do not tend to get the contract number that that spending relates to
default,
default if there is a contract.  
defaultThat is where we get a little bit subtle, but often missing that key piece of information 
defaultmakes it very difficult to join up data sets
default that would give you insight through that joining up. Heather talks about connective tissue
default—
defaultaddresses or postcodes
default: 
defaultevery citizen in the 
defaultUK
default knows their postcode.  
defaultHowever, i
defaultf I said to you, “Do you know your longitude and latitude?” you will not.  
defaultThose are 
defaultoften 
defaultkey moments
default where people, for example, know their geographic information.  T
defaulthere are so many services you
default could use, such as when you go to Amazon or when you go to pay your gas bill.  There are so many things that use your postcode; it is a connection between so many datasets
default,
default because it 
defaultgives
default your geographic information, which then allows you to connect into other data sets.  That is a key point that is difficult in general to legislate.  The key point is that we want to be able to connect data together.  That is a key point
default:
default the power of open data is that it enables us to connect things together and therefore 
defaultto 
defaultgain better insight by joining up sets of information.  
defaultQ47 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reed:default Would there be conventions around that
default as well
default? 
defaultDr Pollock:default Yes, there would.  
defaultQ48 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reed:default Following 
defaulton 
defaultfrom what you said, it would be interesting to know the total public spend for a particular geographic location, but that is a near impossibility.  
defaultOther problems are how granulated data 
defaultis 
defaultor how different data
default sets
default are aggregated together.  
defaultAre th
defaulte
defaultre
default conventions of the kind Tom referred to we could tap into
default 
defaultaround that
default,
default or do
default 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment need to 
defaultguide development of conventions of that sort
default?   
defaultTom Steinbergdefault: 
defaultMany of these things already exist.  You just mentioned a wonderful tool: you mentioned a thing that does not exist yet, which is how much the public sector spent in 100 square yards on different services.  It is a lovely idea
default,
default and I am sure many of you can see how you might use it yourselves as politicians.  It is a new idea
default,
default though
default,
default and because it is a new idea
default,
default you will probably find that the data standards to support it do not exist yet.  I would say 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment absolutely 
defaulthave 
defaulta role 
defaultin participating in those decision-making exercises
default, but if I were going to ask how you put such a nebulous idea into law, I would say it is 
defaultrelatively clear.  If a computer system 
defaultis being 
defaultprovided
default in an area,
default 
defaultthat bit of 
defaultg
defaultovernment 
defaultthat is buying the system in that area 
defaultmust use 
defaultthe 
defaultstandard that
default is being internationally agreed right now.  If there is no such standard
default,
default it should lobby for one and it should participate in the creation of one.  That is relatively simple idea
default: 
defaultif you are in a field
default,
default go and find a standard in that field, use it
default,
default and do not make your own up if there is already one that someone else has.  That does not strike me as too difficult to describe.
defaultHeather Savorydefault: There are several questions here.  As Tom rightly said, there are ubiquitous digital standards for data ranging from CSV to Excel data
default—
defaultas in normal Excel spreadsheets
default—
defaultand up to linked data.  You may know that there is considerable work being done at the Web 3.0 Consortium about linked data.  The premise is that the tech community can cope.  You do not want to be re-inventing or prescribing specific things.  There are preferred standards; the preference is to deliver things in
default a
default machine-readable format that technical people can cope with.  I would also like to say that there are now lots of cheap or free platforms on which you can do data analysis
default 
defaultusing free software
default.  It is not just the highly technical people who can deal with these data sets.  One of the things we push for 
defaultis 
defaultmore APIs.  An API is something that allows you to pull out your own set of data from a big set of data.  You can say, “I want this, this, this and this
default,
default” and you can extract it out.  Whilst these standards all exist and there is a plethora of different things being delivered, the primary thing is that a document or a PDF is not a piece of
default open
default data.  We have now got that far
default—
defaultthat is not open data.  
defaultAcross Government and all public sector bodies
default,
default we need some more help
default—
defaultnot to say, “You must 
defaultdo
default X, Y and Z,” 
defaultbut
default giving us another way that you can get data out.  One of the things that happens at the moment because of the silo nature of Departments and public bodies is that I expect there is some committee somewhere and then some poor chap sitting down in the basement
default—
defaultbecause IT people never have windows
default—
defaultand somebody will come knocking on the door and say, “You’ve got to deliver that as open data
default.
default”  This poor guy will be going, “I wonder what that means.  What do I do?”  Then whoever it is will go back upstairs and carry on with their policy job
default,
default because we have told him this organisation is going to be delivering open data.  
defaultSome technical guidance would be useful across 
defaultWhitehall
default to give people more assistance about the preferred ways and challenges of delivering this open data.  Some people will find it easier than others.  I fully support the changes to the procurement rules because, as Tom has said, building in the method of delivering this data does put it at a real margin
defaultal
default cost.  You might be astonished that
default,
default with current systems
default,
default 
defaultour
default data 
defaultis sometimes 
defaultlocked up 
defaultand
default 
defaultsome of the incumbent IT suppliers to Government charge us for getting
default that
default data
default,
default because they have to extract it and nobody else can do that.  That is fundamental to moving the agenda forward and making it work.  
defaultThe other thing that I would just point the Committee to is that the Open Data Institute has just released a certificate
default—
defaulta method where you can go and self-rate your own open data.  It is in beta; you can find it on 
defaultits 
defaultwebsite.  That is a really useful tool for the community because it has all the bits that you need to know.  I would say it is a little bit fluffy in terms of supply and release dates
default,
default because if I am going to build a business based on this data
default,
default I want to know that it is going to be maintained.  It is no good having a data set now, updating it in six months and then leaving it for three years
default,
default because my business will be dependent on it.  This shows you w
defaulth
defaultere you can get it and it gives a good indicator of the quality of the data, so I think it would be a very positive move to have that and some sort of help or guidance note that went across the picture.  
defaultThere is one technical point I wanted to bring up in legislation terms.  I have to refer to my notes here; I have to get it right.  There is the Freedom of Information Act and there was a Protection of Freedoms Act 2012.  This is regulation that has just been brought into force
default,
default and this established an enhanced right to data because it introduces a statutory duty for public authorities to publish their data for re-use.  I absolutely agree we do not have clean legislation.  There is not an Open Data Act, but if you look at the complex network of legislation that we have
default,
default there is already a presumption to publish data and there are duties for public bodies to make their data available for re-use.  
defaultQ49 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default That is very useful.  Very briefly, before we move on, how confident 
defaultare you
default that Government have
default the right skills to do open data?  
defaultDr Pollock:default In some ways I do not think it has to be super-complicated.  Some of it is reasonably straightforward in the sense of, “Publish it
default.”
default  I would go back to this point that you can adopt best
default 
defaultpractice and so on.  If 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment 
defaultare 
defaultdoing machine-readable
default,
default people will complain and they will bug you, but if we are getting it out there
default,
default you are doing okay.  Government obviously has a reasonable amount of sophisticated knowledge, certainly in IT team
defaults
default and so on, so I do not think that is a barrier right now.  There could of course be more knowledge about data
default,
default and it is also a generational aspect, but a lack of IT knowledge is not what is preventing 
defaultthe Government 
defaultfrom passing legislation
default right now
default.  
defaultQ50 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Does everybody agree with that?  
defaultHeather Savorydefault: I agree with that.  I think there are awareness and attitude problems.  
defaultQ51 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I was going to ask
default: 
defaultwhat is the attitude problem?  
defaultHeather Savorydefault: T
defaulthere are perceived risks among civil servants, which is 
defaultnatural because they have been brought up in a world where they are protective
default—
defaultthey are protective of the public and they also have concerns about their individual responsibilities.  
defaultMany 
defaulttimes I get re-quoted at me the poor chap in HMRC who left the CD on the train as the reason we should not have open data.  They have genuine concerns about the privacy of the public
default,
default because privacy does need to be maintained.  They are also concerned because their data is not perfect, but no data set is perfect.  So there are those cultural issues that we need to find ways to give people confidence about.  There is also a lack of belief that the technical community can deal with this stuff, whereas there are some workshops that we have held where is a guy who said, “Just give me big, dirty data.  I’ll deal with it
default.”
default  That is a place where those organisations can add value.  
defaultQ52 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default How do you think the problem of attitude and awareness should be addressed?    
defaultHeather Savorydefault: I think it is difficult.  
defaultYou could promote 
defaultthe benefits to the economy, promot
defaulte
default the growth agenda and show people case studies of how data can be better used
default.  T
defaulthere are lots of examples now of where open data is
default used in the
default delivery of public services.  
defaultQ53 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default So they need to be
default made aware of those examples.
defaultThis is a question for all of you: how well do you think the different bits of 
defaultg
defaultovernment are working together on open data, such as the Cabinet Office, BIS and other public bodies?  
defaultDr Pollock:default 
defaultYou also asked 
defaulta
default similar
default 
defaultquestion
default.  This is almost being a little bit facetious.  There are 
defaultC
defaultivil 
defaultS
defaultervice awards and so on
default,
default and one thing that was debated was that you could have a big open data prize and say, “This Department
default”—
defaultor 
defaultt
defaulthis civil servant
default—“
defaultlast year did the most prestigious thing
default,
default” 
defaultor t
defaulthings like that
default.
default              
defaultChair:default We do not 
defaultusually 
defaultmake recommendations to 
defaultCivil S
defaultervice 
defaultW
defaultorld
default, but we could add it t
defaulto the
default list.  
defaultDr Pollock:default Exactly.  
defaultY
defaultou
default can
default ask 
defaultthe base question of
default,
default 
default“H
defaultow did your attitude change
default?” 
default 
defaultIn 
defaulta system like 
defaultthis, it 
defaultis partly a slow process, but 
defaultit is 
defaultalso 
defaultdone 
defaultby creating champions
default and 
defaultby highlighting people who have been pioneering
default.  T
defaulthe point Heather is getting at fundamentally is 
defaultthat 
defaultthe risk/reward setup of Government tends to be risk averse.  
defaultQ54 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default What about how Departments work together on open data?  
defaultHeather Savorydefault: 
defaultDo you mean in 
defaultterms of driving the agenda?  Obviously you have the Cabinet
default&#xa0;
defaultOffice Public Sector Transparency Board
default and
default you have BIS
default,
default with information economy, growth and the Public Data Group, which is the four trad
defaulting funds.  Then you have the MO
defaultJ 
defaultand 
defaultNational Archives
default,
default which
default are doing all the legislative side
default,
default and then you have the Information Commissioner’s Office.  Do they work together?  Yes.  Do they work together well?  Most of the time.  Are you going to be able to change that at policy level?  No
default,
default because you need all those elements of the policy.  
defaultChair:default This is becoming a pet of mine: it is the usual 
default“headquarters of 
defaultGovernment
default”
default problem.  There is not one.  
defaultHeather Savorydefault: There are always tensions there.  
defaultQ55 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default You are so diplomatic
default—
defaultmuch more than me.  Do you have a prize for the best Department or the worst Department?  
defaultHeather Savorydefault: 
defaultThe 
defaultOffice 
defaultfor
default National Statistics.  
defaultChair:default Is
default it the
default best?  
defaultHeather Savorydefault: Yes.  
defaultQ56 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default That is nice for us to hear.  Who is worst?  
defaultHeather Savorydefault: It is difficult to say who is worst.  The ones that I find the most irritating are those who release data sets and pretend that they are under the open government licence and then you discover that they are not under the open government licence.  It is a bit of a pseudo-open deliver
defaulty
default of data.  
defaultQ57 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Can you just explain that?  If it is not on the open government licence
default,
default why is it not open government?  
defaultHeather Savorydefault: That would be my question to them.  There are a lot of published data sets that
default,
default until you actually go and look at them
default,
default you think you are going to find under the open 
defaultg
defaultovernment licence
default,
default and then you find they are not or they are not quite. 
defaultQ58 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default What does that mean?  
defaultDr Pollock:default That they are not open.  
defaultHeather Savorydefault: It means they are not fully open for use and re-use.  It means they are not free.  It means that there are licensing conditions attached to them.    
defaultQ59 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default And this affects the potential business opportunities.  
defaultHeather Savorydefault: Absolutely, yes.  You have to be able to let this data flow through the system.  
defaultTom Steinbergdefault: I have an answer, which is it is the Members of the House of Commons and Lords who have, as of yet, not updated our information legislation so that
default,
default as more and more bits of the public sector get outsourced
default,
default we will gradually lose sight of essentially how 
defaultg
defaultovernment works.  Our children will know much les
defaults about how the Government work
default and whether or not 
defaultthey are 
defaultdoing a good job than we do.  This is a relatively well
default-
defaultknown issue, but I have not 
defaultyet 
defaultseen it become a really big enough issue that anyone has tabled a
default serious
default amendment.  It is an absolutely terribly serious issue.  
defaultQ60 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Is that in your written evidence?  
defaultTom Steinbergdefault: 
defaultI am
default afraid I have not provided any written evidence.  
defaultQ61 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Can you send us a note about what you really mean by that so that we have something concrete that we can refer to in our 
defaultr
defaulteport?
default  I would be very grateful for that.  Blog it if you wish.  Dr Pollock? 
defaultDr Pollock:default The Office 
defaultfor 
defaultNational Statistics has done well.  Some of the Departments that are the parents of trading funds have done less
default well
default, but that has now been centralised to some extent into BIS.  There has not always been great oversight of 
defaultthe 
defaulttrading funds by their parent Departments, perhaps naturally so.  Now it is the Shareholder Executive plus a parent Department.  Recently
default,
default there has been this inventory where 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment 
defaultare 
defaultsupposed to bring out their data sets and say, “While we have not released them openly yet, these are the ones we have
default,
default” so that people can actually know what they have.  I do not know if it has 
defaultbeen 
defaultupdated now, but Treasury had a total of eight data sets that 
defaultit 
defaultknew of that had not been opened up.  I would say that Treasury has been a blocker.  
defaultThe Treasury itself 
defaultdo
defaultes
default not have data sets, but 
defaultit has 
defaultbeen a major blocker of much of this.  That is reversed from 
defaultthe 
defaultposition before
default,
default where 
defaultit was 
defaultgetting to the point where 
defaultit 
defaultunderstood the trade-off between giving up a small amount of jam today for a lot of jam tomorrow.   
defaultQ62 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Could you give us in writing examples of the data sets you think they should be releasing as open data but that they are not?  
defaultDr Pollock:default To be clear, the Treasury does not have them, but 
defaultit is 
defaultoften a deciding factor
default,
default because 
defaultit is the one
default who 
defaulthas 
defaultto say, “Okay, the postcode address file.  That will maybe knock £10 million total off the amount we sell Royal Mail for, but it will generate £100 million a year for the 
defaultUK
default economy, but we won’t do that because we’re so worried about jam today
default.
default”  
defaultQ63 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Will you send us a note about that?  
defaultDr Pollock:default I will do my best, absolutely.  
defaultQ64 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Presumably
default, 
defaultthere needs to be a regular audit of open data
default, as you have all indicated
default.  It needs to be published so that we can see how well each public body is doing.  Would you support such a recommendation?  How would that be implemented?  
defaultHeather Savorydefault: In its response to the Shakespeare 
defaultr
defaulteview, the Cabinet Office has composed the National Information Infrastructure and is actively working on that at the moment.  That will be made public at the end of this month at the Open Government Partnership Conference.  That will go a long way to improving the tracking mechanisms.  I work in association with the Cabinet Office.  
defaultIt is 
defaultworking very hard now with Departments to actually get this inventory out.  That is very important because we put in place a data request mechanism that demonstrates user demand.  That is what th
defaulte Open Data User Group has focu
defaults
defaulted its work on: what users need.  That is the demand side, but this will articulate the supply side.  I would say
default,
default though
default,
default that this will only be the first step.  Anybody who says at the end of this month, “Here it is
default—
defaultthe National Information Infrastructure is delivered
default,
default” is deluded
default,
default because there is more work to do to identify what data is there.  
defaultQ65 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Presumably that will be an endless task.  
defaultHeather Savorydefault: It will.  Yes, it will be an endless task until the point that procurement rules include the presumption to get your data sorted out up
default 
defaultfront.  In the medium to long term
default,
default I cannot see where the oversight is going to come from when this
default is
default embedded.  At the moment
default,
default you have different people in different policy areas.  At the end of the day, in two or three years
default’
default time, somebody needs to be given there responsibility to make sure that this embedded system, as it will be by then, is maintained for the long-term public good.  
defaultQ66 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Could this be a role for UKSA and ONS?  
defaultDr Pollock:default On the regulatory side
default,
default this is one of the old ones.  This was a recommendation in 
defaultModels of Public Sector Information Provision via Trading Funds
default, which 
defaultI, Professor Bently and Professor Newbery at 
defaultCambridge
default wrote.  It has never been implemented
default,
default and the UK Government 
defaultwere 
defaultinstrumental in having 
defaultit 
defaultcut out of the revised PSI Directive, which was the idea of an independent regulator of a bunch of this.  For example, 
defaulton 
defaulttrading funds
default, 
defaulta classic thing is 
defaultthat 
defaultif you are going to allow some entity to provide information
default,
default you need to regulate quality. 
default 
defaultOrdnance Survey, for example, has to provide maps for the 
defaultUK
default,
default and you are going to say, “Maybe we are either going to give you a subsidy now or we’re going to provide some set of money
default.
default”  The Government already pay
default 
defaultit 
default£50
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion a year.  
defaultThe worry that trading funds have often had is if they are dependent on Government money
default,
default what happens in the bad times
default?  
defaultIn the bad times
default,
default everyone gets their hair cut
default,
default and suddenly you cannot do your mapping anymore.  One way to run that is to have an independent regulator who both guarantees that they are at arm
default’
defaults length
default—they
default get provided money by the Government
default—
defaultbut at the same time monitors quality and other things.  There is a question at the moment of what happens if people complain?  At the moment
default,
default they can come to the Open Data User Group and we can go to the Cabinet Office and complain, but it is not a very enforceable structure regarding access to some of these things.  You have the Information Commissioner and things around other stuff, and one of the recommendations is having some proper regulatory oversight of this going forward that we do not really have today.  
defaultTom Steinbergdefault: This was the issue over which I decided that I would no longer be on the Transparency Board.  
defaultA
default group of six civil servants from different Departments got on the telephone to tell me that the idea of independent regulation was not worthy for what are essentially entities
default—
defaulttrading funds that
default,
default if they want
default,
default can just shave margin off every business and bit of 
defaultgovernment 
defaultin the country with no challenge.  They told me it was a stupid and bureaucratic idea.  
defaultQ67 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Six civil servants sounds like a campaign.  
defaultTom Steinbergdefault: You asked me before which Department was most problematic
default,
default and I gave a non-answer
default,
default because I said Parliament, which is not a Department.  
defaultActually,
default I do think that was largely orchestrated by the Treasury.  They were the ones who were most opposed to the idea of more regulation
default,
default because they were in the business of making less regulation.  I understand that there are ideological issues about more or less regulation, but if I were running a country
default,
default I would not want entities that had the ability to suck the margins out of every business in the country to do so unregulated.  In my view, that is the situation today.  In the view of 
defaultWhitehall
default,
default these entities are regulated
default—
defaultjust by Whitehall Departments.  If that is the question, I would ask why we have any regulators at all.  Why is every singly utility in the country not just directly regulated out of the Home Office or BIS and so on?  The answer is because there is a different character and quality of analysis to independent regulators.  These trading funds desperately need to be run by independent regulators.  The fact that I could not move the Government at all on that 
defaultwas 
defaultwhy I quit.  
default              defaultChair:default That comment has made a very strong impression on me. 
defaultDr Pollock:default Very briefly, 
defaultModels of Public Sector Information Provision via Trading Funds
default,
default the 2008 report for 
defaultthe 
defaultTreasury
default,
default has a whole chapter on 
defaultregulation
default.  It makes a very clear recommendation at the end.  It is very simple and distils why you should have this.  There are also the comments of the trading funds in readable prose.   
default              defaultChair:default Very good.  We will look at that.  Thank you very much.  
defaultQ68 default&#xa0; 
defaultKelvin defaultHopkinsdefault:default I have just a couple of comments on what Tom
default&#xa0;
defaultSteinberg has said particularly.  I am most interested in what he last said, but his previous comment about the future we face with the direction of Governments moving towards a completely privatised world suggests we might get to a point when there is almost no way of judging how the world is operating.  Democracy itself seems to be a bit of 
defaulta 
defaultnonsense because we cannot make any judgments on what is happening.  That is a thought.  Before that
default,
default you suggested that we did not need a central, standardised way of making sure that local authorities delivered their data in comparable or accessible ways.  I just wondered if that was really what you were saying because it strikes me as being a very good idea
default,
default so that local authorities cannot hide their bad performance if they put their data out in a way that is not comparable with other authorities.  
defaultTom Steinbergdefault: Standards for data are important, especially if
default,
default as I said
default,
default the main lever for change is procurement.  I really believe the main lever 
defaultis 
defaultthat all new computer systems should be embedding these standards when they come off the shelf.  My only difference of opinion there is that I do not think the British Government should decide that 
defaultthey have 
defaultto own, run, maintain and invent all these standards.  There are 
defaultmany things this Government do
default that many other Governments are doing and, therefore, just like we have comparable unemployment rates
default,
default we should in the future have data standards embedded in the software Government buys
default.
default 
default W
defaulthen a piece of spending, a contract or performance data measuring the performance of some contract comes out, it should come out in the same format here, in Bolivia, New Zealand and everywhere else that kind of computer system is installed.  There should be standards, but not organised only by the British Government.   
defaultDr Pollock:default There is just a quick thing I want to add.  The danger Tom has not alluded to is that 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment will regulate and say, “You must use standard
default X
default,”
default but technology moves quickly.  In three years’ time
default,
default that standard may be superseded, so there is a significant danger of embedding some precise rule into legislation in technologically rapidly moving areas.  It would be better to say, “Use best practice
default,”
default whatever that is.  
defaultQ69 default&#xa0; 
defaultKelvin defaultHopkinsdefault:default Just one example of where there seems to be no agreement is on what we call the tax gap
default—
defaulttax avoidance
default; 
defaulttax evasion.  There are some estimates that put it at well over £100
default&#xa0;
defaultbillion; HMRC puts it much lower than that.  There seems to be no acceptance of a common view on what the tax gap is.  If there were some standardised way of measuring it or defining it
default,
default we would actually be better off in terms of information.  Anyway, that is not my question.  My question really is: the review by 
defaultStephan
default&#xa0;
defaultShakespeare of YouGov
default suggests that the Government should have twin-track policy for data release that recognises that the perfect should not be the enemy of the good.  They should simultaneously publish early even if imperfect data, but at the same time with a commitment to what he calls a “high quality core”.  Do you think that is sensible?  
defaultTom Steinbergdefault: GDP, which is probably the single number that people in Whitehall care about more than anything else
default,
default is published and then revised infinitely
default, yet 
defaultthere have been much less important data sets that have not been released because we cannot make a mistake.  I would say to make one of two calls.  Either do not publish GDP until you are really confident
default—
defaultin other words, about two and a half years after it is relevant
default—
defaultor be consistent in the Government’s 
defaultapproach to
default data and say
default,
default 
default“T
defaulthe public can cope with the idea that it is not perfect, and the public can cope with the idea that it is going to iterate over time and get better.
default”
default  I am very much in favour of the second position.  
defaultDr Pollock:default Sadly, it is almost always used as an excuse to not publish information: “It’s not perfect yet.  People will misuse it.  They will drive off cliffs because the geographic information has a road leading off a cliff
default.”
default  I have heard that genuinely from someone before.  
defaultQ70 default&#xa0; 
defaultKelvin defaultHopkinsdefault:default The
defaultre is the
default phrase “Governments wishing to bury bad news
default”—they 
defaultcan use that excuse by not publishing things that might embarrass them, for example.  
defaultHeather Savorydefault: Can I add to that?  The answer is to publish the result and publish the underlying data, and let other people look at your calculation or look at different ways of coming up with things to compare the result.  The ONS does this.  It now publishes statistics and there is a move, which is hugely welcomed, within the ONS to publish the underlying data sets that those statistics are derived from.  On the questions of how we should measure or how we should 
defaultcalculate, you can pick any way, 
defaultbut just open up.  This is where it is about transparency for 
defaultg
defaultovernment: open that up and let other clever people
default—
defaultbecause there are clever people all over the place
default—
defaulthave a look at what you have done and understand maybe the limitations of your calculation or suggest a better way.  This is why this is so powerful.  
defaultQ71 default&#xa0; 
defaultKelvin defaultHopkinsdefault:default The GDP revisions tend to be very small but
default,
default on the other 
defaulthand,
default if it is the difference between zero growth and 0.1% growth
default,
default Governments will claim success.  
default              defaultChair:default There was no double-dip.  We thought there was a double
default&#x2011;
defaultdip and there was no double
default&#x2011;
defaultdip.  
default              defaultKelvin defaultHopkinsdefault:default Indeed.  On other things
default,
default there are massive differences.  I raise these constantly; the tax gap is one of my obsessions, but it is almost never mentioned by comparison with the tiny amount we lose from 
defaultbenefit 
defaultfraud, which is made much of.  The tax gap, which is gigantic, is played down.  It is politics.  The one other question I had is how we lessen the risks posed to privacy by open data
default.  
defaultDr Pollock:default It is a really important issue.  Talking 
defaultearlier,
default I said something like we should make a principle of open data by default for non-personal data.  I really reiterate this
default,
default so that by default when we talk about open data
default,
default we are obviously not talking about private data.  The risk is in what Heather said, for example.  Much of the data underlying national statistics is information from individual people or organisations sometimes.  One 
defaultprinciple 
defaultis that open data is not stuff that has privacy implications.  We do also want to think quite carefully.  Crime statistics are a good example.  One of the interesting things is the variation.  In the 
defaultUnited States
default,
default they quite happily publish granular crime statistics of exactly where the crime happened, where it was
default and 
defaultwhat time, but obviously not the exact person.  Whereas in the 
defaultUK
default,
default there was this whole debate that I could work out where this ha
defaultd
default occurred
default—
defaulthad a rape happened in a house
default,
default I would 
defaultknow 
defaultsomething very significant personally about someone.  There is clearly going to be ongoing debate.  
defaultI do not think there is an easy answer to this
default,
default and I think it is going to be one where some of the most interesting data 
defaultwill have
default a relationship with personal information
default—
defaultcrime statistics or crime data, in fact.  
defaultT
defaulthe default position has to be that we protect privacy in the first instance, but it is important that there are cases where we make public interest trade-offs.  We think that we are entitled to know the directors of public companies; it is not something that is private.  By having a limited liability company
default,
default you give up your right to 
defaultprivacy—people
default know that you are a director.  Those are going to be interesting questions.  The really interesting question over the next 10, 20 or 30 years is how we make the trade-offs between privacy and public interest in a variety of areas.  One has been around the VAT register
default—
defaultshould the VAT register not be published because it possibly has privacy implications?  
default              
defaultQ72 default&#xa0; 
defaultKelvin defaultHopkinsdefault:default There are some countries, such as in 
defaultScandinavia
default, w
defaulth
defaultere they publish people’s personal tax returns and so on.  That sort of privacy is thought to be unacceptable in a democracy
default—
defaultthat we
default ought to know
default.
default  We tend to be much more worried about privacy.  
default              defaultChair:default Can we let the other witnesses answer your original question?  
defaultHeather Savorydefault: I agree with you that it is a cultural issue.  I am quite interested to see what happens in the next generation
default,
default because they just work in such a different way.  They communicate differently
default.  They 
defaulthave a lot of private information available
default and 
defaultseem to be far less fazed by it all, 
defaultalthough 
defaultthat could turn around.  
defaultThe VAT register is quite interesting because it is a good case study of what happens with Departments.  We have this with the VAT register and we have it with DVLA data as well.  The thing is, “We can’t open up the data because we’ll increase fraud
default,
default and personal data will be there
default.
default”  This is coming back to the attitudes about it.  With the VAT register
default,
default we found there is actually an EU site you can go to, VIES, where you can go and type any member state, VAT number
default,
default and it gives you the address.  Sometimes you find that these issues of privacy have already been superseded.  People do not actually know how much information is available about them.  It is only when you start talking about releasing it as bulk data that people start to get concerned about it.  
defaultHaving said that, we want open data but we do not want to compromise privacy.  As Rufus has said, we have to make some decisions about how to anonymise data.  There are some really quite serious working groups at the moment looking at anonymisation and pseudonimisation of data so that you can release these data sets in a way that 
defaultmeans 
defaultthey can be hugely beneficial, but without identifying individuals.  
defaultMy last point is cultural.  When you ask citizens to put their personal data up for a good cause like the Human Genome Project or various health projects
default,
default you find a totally different attitude.  If people feel they are giving their data in a beneficial way
default,
default they are much more open to allowing it to be used for research, etc.  
defaultQ73 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Can I just probe on one particular question, which is this generational difference?  How do you think that can be reflected in Government policy
default,
default or does Government policy have to evolve with changing generational attitudes towards privacy?  
defaultTom Steinbergdefault: Yes.  Step one is accepting the fact that values in this field are changing really fast and changing in ways we do not fully understand yet.  
defaultThat means understanding 
defaultthat
default,
default unlike legislation for a crime, where you are pretty sure people will think that is wrong today and still think it wrong in 20 years’ time
default, instead 
defaultyou have to think of this much more like something that is inevitably going to change quite quickly.  I would argue that if Parliament has a role here
default,
default it is probably to make sure that there is some kind of regular review that is much faster than normal, decade-long legislative cycles 
defaultand 
defaultcan cope with the fact that what is acceptable today may even have changed in acceptability in just two or three years’ time.  I would like to see Parliament say every 12 months or every 24 months the Government 
defaultare 
defaultessentially going to be tasked 
defaultto assess 
defaultwhat is normal, or Parliament itself will meet to discuss what is now acceptable and what is not acceptable in this trade-off between privacy and public.  The only thing that is permanent is the decision to review it very regularly in a way that there rest of the public sector can understand.  
defaultThe public sector really needs some guidance that lands on their desks that basically goes, “These kinds of trade-offs are okay and these kinds are not
default,
default” because you are never goi
defaultng to be able to draw a crystal-
defaultclear legal definitional line between them.  It is not going to exist in this field; it is all shades of grey.  What you can give people
default,
default though
default,
default is five examples 
defaultof what 
defaultMembers here vote in a majority to say are acceptable trade-offs and five that are not.  Review those in two years and there might be a different five and a different five.  I would love to see a decade in which we prepared for the knowledge that these values are going to change so quickly and that the political and technical context is going to change very quickly, and that in the diary we know when it is going to be next revised
default,
default even though it has not happened yet.  That would be a great step forward.  
defaultQ74 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reed:default I will just confine myself to one question.  
defaultChair:default 
defaultThat is
default economic
default innovation and 
defaultso on
default.  Mr Pollock, can you take the first answer because I know you have to leave?
defaultMr Reed:default How well do
default the Government understand the needs of different commercial users of open data?  
defaultDr Pollock:default It is a difficult question because there are so many.  Heather has emphasised that sometimes it is quite 
defaultwell known
default what 
defaultsome of 
defaultthose desires are, but the challenge is often they are the ones the Government 
defaultare 
defaultleast inclined to satisfy for other reaso
defaultns.  I think the Government do
default have a sense
default of that
default, but a key point is that much of this is about innovation.  It is always a challenge of doing stuff: maybe it is people who are 10 or 15 today who are going to build a company in two, three or five years.  It is very difficult because they are not normally the people who come to this room or even know yet what their wants are.  
defaultOne of our lessons of innovation, particularly in the digital space, is that you do not know what you are going to build
default,
default and often when you think you know what you are going to build
default,
default you are wrong.  In that sense, the whole point of opening up data is that it is the unexpected.  It is the many-minds principle.  The best thing to do with your data will be thought of by someone else, not by you.  That aspect is essential to this.  In a way, it is currently a debate about high
default&#x2011;
defaultvalue/low
default&#x2011;
defaultvalue data sets.  There are some things we can see now there are desires for, but some of the things that are most interesting we are not going to anticipate.  Maybe someone will come up with a credible way to spot tax evasion or tax avoidance, or better ways to look at benefit fraud, or better ways to identify how 
defaultg
defaultovernment saves money.  Those are the most unexpected aspects of this
default,
default and we are not sure where th
defaulte
defaulty will come from.  It may be some other data set that we cannot even think of.  
defaultThat is one of the 
defaultfundamental 
defaultpoints here, in the sense that it is very difficult for commercial entities.  Google could come and tell us, but those that are most exciting and most interesting I think would find it very difficult to come and tell us.  This is why “
defaultget 
defaultit out there” is the general approach.  
defaultQ75 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reed:default Is there any way that 
defaultg
defaultovernment can engage with that kind of dynamic, entrepreneurial fast-moving world?  
defaultDr Pollock:default Go to events.  Get out of 
defaultg
defaultovernment and do not run consultations.  That is my other big point.  People who write responses to consultations, even me
default,
default are busy
default—
defaulttechnical innovators are busy.  Go to where they are.  Go to their meet-ups, go to their events, go to their conferences and listen to them.  Unfortunately
default, 
defaultsometimes the Government in other times 
defaulthave 
defaultsaid
default, “No one has a travel budget to get anywhere.
default”
default  Go to those things; it sometimes means people
default have to do it
default in their spare time.  They happen in evenings or weekends, or require you to travel to another country.  Go to where they are and listen to them.  
defaultHeather Savorydefault: 
defaultThat is actually one of the reasons I am here
default,
default because obviously the Open Data User Group was set up to try 
defaultto
default improve that.  
defaultIn terms of Government understanding, I think one o
defaultf the things the Government do
default not understand is how big companies need this data.  I have something to wave at you as an example.  This is done by Deloitte
default,
default and it is using open data.  It is a demographic analysis of how population is moving and where current bank branch networks are.  Nobody likes the banks much at one level, but they are very important in our society.  This shows that retired people are all moving to the seaside
default,
default and it shows that young, upwardly mobile people are moving into cities.  This is based on open data.  This is why companies that you do not think of as needing open data need this open data.  These are the utilities companies, Sainsbury’s, Tesco, etc.  
default              
defaultOn the start-up side
default,
default we need to make more of case studies.  One of the things I want to do this year is to try 
defaultto 
defaultpromote some of the really good examples of businesses built on open data.  We need to gain confidence, particularly within the Treasury, 
defaultso 
defaultthat this 
defaultout-of-
defaultbalance 
default“
defaultsmall amount of money for big benefit
default”
default could be tipped when 
defaultthey 
defaultstart to see some tangible results.  
defaultThe primary 
defaultthing
default,
default 
defaultwhich 
defaultcomes back to what both my colleagues here have said
default,
default is about pace.  Government just does not understand the difference in pace between 
defaultWhitehall
default and Departments, and then somewhere along the line there are other public sector bodies
default,
default and the business world, and businesses of all size.  For example, we have had 500 data requests since last year.  They are all moving slowly through the system and some of them are now coming to fruition.  What these start-up companies want is if it is a “no” because of private data issues
default,
default it needs to be “no” tomorrow
default,
default because then they will go and do something different.  Then in 
defaultWhitehall
default everyone is saying, “You’re not doing badly, are you?  Things are moving really quickly, aren’t they?” and then I have my group saying, “This is glacial
default.”
default  
defaultThere are
default two cultures 
defaultthere.
defaultQ76 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Do you think this is all tainted by a Sir
default&#xa0;
defaultHumphrey disdain for the idea that people should make money out of public data
default—
defaultthat there is something rather distasteful about it?  
defaultHeather Savorydefault: There are definitely some individuals I have met during the course of the last year who do not seem to understand the fundamental connection between making money, paying tax and delivering public services.  I found that quite shocking.  This is a virtuous circle.  
defaultTom Steinbergdefault: Can I just answer your question? 
default 
defaultI slightly take issue with the idea that the Government should nee
defaultd
default to understand much about me.  If I have truly amazing, wonderful new idea, it is entirely likely that no
default 
defaultone understands it except me, let alone the people on the other side of the table.  Luckily they got rid of this, but it used to be that the Ordnance Survey asked for your business model so that 
defaultit 
defaultcould read it and understand your need.  At one level
default,
default that sounds like it makes sense, but at another level the mom
defaultent you say the Government need
default to understand what someone needs some data for
default 
defaultis the moment you say
default,
default 
default“O
defaultur Government’s data policy has basically excluded true innovation.
default”
default  
defaultThe nature of innovation is often to see value where other people just cannot see it.  No
default 
defaultone saw that there was much value in a list of Harvard undergraduates except Mark
default&#xa0;
defaultZuckerberg; no one saw there was much value in the links on the internet pointing to other websites except the people who founded Google.  A characteristic of some digital innovation is precisely people seeing value.  If the Government 
defaultare 
defaultset up to say, “We’ll give it to you if we understand the value
default,
default” that is just basically a way of saying, “We wouldn’t like any innovative companies, please
default.
default”  I would like it to be thought of in a rights model much more than in an unders
defaulttanding model.  That is to say: 
defaultif I tell you that it is important to me and it does not place an unreasonable burden on the public sector
default,
default I will get it.  Merely by coincidence, that is how the Freedom of Information Act is structured at the moment.  It does not work
default,
default though
default,
default if I go and ask the Government for some bit of data.  That is very much how it needs to work, precisely with the 
default18-year-
defaultold Rufus talked about
default,
default who is not going to know how to make a value case to a civil servant in civil servant language.  
defaultDr Pollock:default You need to connect to the electricity grid
default: “
defaultCan you tell us why you need electricity to run your factory?”
defaultQ77 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default You would be surprised.
defaultCan I ask one final question?  Stephan Shakespeare talks about how our country could be at the front of a wave of innovation that would provide another big service industry we would export all over the world as other countries move to open data.  Do you agree with that analysis or that conjecture?  
defaultCould 
defaultwe 
defaultbe 
defaultthe home of all the new apps, applications and development
default?
default  
defaultDr Pollock:default It is definitely possible.  There are big forces at work, but one example often given of where we failed was that the 
defaultUS
default opened up geographic information in the 
default’
default80s.  It was v
defaultery liberal about access to geo-
defaultinformation and we were not; we actually shut it down under Thatcher by charging more 
defaultand Ordnance
default 
defaultS
defaulturvey
default 
defaultmoving to the trading fund model quite aggressively.  It is always cited
default;
default there is the famous 
defaultsaying 
defaultby 
defaultWeiss
default 
defaultwhere he is saying in the 
defaultUS
default you have this really big geographic information system industry.  There are people selling geographic software, not selling data.  There is also the example of weather derivatives as well in the US, where access to free weather data made it much easier to build a weather derivatives market
default,
default where you could insure weather risk much better and more efficiently.  There is that possibility.  The world moves fast
default,
default so we need to do that.  There is potential.  There is going to be competition in that space
default,
default and it relates to the software industry and other things.  It relates to having a good venture capital industry and having a good set of people who are trained in data and information skills.  We run the 
defaultSchool
default of 
defaultData
default because we think all this data coming out is great, but do people know how to use it, particularly people who are not data geeks?  That is the other challenge.  It is not just going to be the data out there; it is going to be the skills, the infrastructure and the funding to build the businesses to do that as well.
defaultChair:default I think that was a yes.  
defaultDr Pollock:default Yes, that was a yes.  
defaultHeather Savorydefault: I got slightly confuse
defaultd
default by your question because I think there are two aspects to this.  There is the 
defaultUK
default’s skill at open data
default, 
defaultwhich is what I suddenly thought you might be asking.  To what extent can we influence other countries and share our best
default 
defaultpractice in terms of what we do here?  I think the answer there is yes
default,
default because we are at the front of the field.  I agree with what Rufus is saying there.  There is absolutely a skill shortage.  
defaultA
default lot of techy friends are now delighted because somebody has said that being a data scientist is going to be the sexiest job in the 21
defaultst
default century.  That is actually true: there are opportunities.  We need those skills.  We also need to make sure that the financiers really can depend on this source of material.  That is fundamental.  I am not going to back a business if I do not think that this data is going to be available in two years’ time. 
defaultQ78 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default The rights-based model rather than a permission-based model.  I understand that.  
defaultTom Steinbergdefault: I think we have almost everything we need to be building the 2013 versions of the 1990s and 
default’
default80s tools that were mentioned there.  You mentioned earlier on the idea of a tool that could tell you how much public money had been spent in an area.  Someone can get paid to build that tool and someone can get paid for selling it to Governments around the world.  It will get built in the country where the data to power 
defaultit 
defaultis available
default,
default and right now that is not 
defaultGreat Britain
default.  The reason it is not 
defaultGreat Britain
default is because the Treasury does not believe that is a way that we will generate economic growth.  
defaultIt 
defaultjust fundamentally do
defaultes
default not buy the argument at a very deep level.  One of the things that I have found mostly impossible is to change 
defaultits mind
default on that issue
default,
default and that is why I am no longer actively involved in this field.  
defaultQ79 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Reed:default Is it worse 
defaultthan you have just outlined
default, in that the argument 
defaulti
defaults
default that 
defaultit sees 
defaultnegative outcomes from it?  
defaultTom Steinbergdefault: 
defaultIt 
defaultsee
defaults
default a loss
default of short-term revenue, yes.  
defaultHeather Savorydefault: There is a negative outcome
default,
default because they will lose certain income streams.  That 
defaultis known.  That is why the cost-
defaultbenefit argument is there.  It is what I said earlier: it is the funding model versus the economic model.  We also have to have faith in the 
defaultUK
default.  We have done some great things
default,
default and this is a fundamentally easy place for the 
defaultUK
default to generate growth.  That is what we need people to see.  You do not need huge capital infrastructure.  I have a guy who took the INSPIRE database.  It is a huge database.  The comput
defaulting
default power that you can get for £10,000 will allow you to do an awful lot of development with this open data.  The difficulties that you have are finding the skills and paying the people to do it.  That is the side of this that needs to be addressed.  
defaultI cannot see many other places.  There are other places where we are strong in sciences, etc., but if you look at the potential for growth that we have here
default,
default we do have a platform to build on in the 
defaultUK
default.  We have great people; we have great technologists and great scientists; we have great brains.  This does not require you to build a factory.  I came from the semiconductor industry
default;
default we used to have semiconductor 
defaultfabs
default here and they all moved to the 
defaultFar East
default.  They moved to the 
defaultFar East
default 
defaultnot just because of the costing, 
defaultbut
default because as technology improved, 
defaultyou needed purer water
default—
defaultthere are geographical factors there as well. 
default 
defaultThere are none of those here.  It is about people and computers.  We have those.  
defaultChair:default It has been a really good evidence session.  You are all fantastic witnesses.  Thank you very much indeed
default,
default and if you see our subsequent evidence session and have any further thoughts
default,
default please do whack in any further comments that you might like.  We will certainly take heed of the
defaultm.  Thank you very much indeed.
