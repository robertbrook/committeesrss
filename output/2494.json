"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Amicus Horizon Ltd, &#xa0;\nExecutive summary:&#xa0;&#xa0;\n1.0About AmicusHorizon &#xa0;1.1\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.3\nWe own and manage over\n 28,000 homes across London and the South East of England. We focus on core social housing activities offe\nring a range of housing options. \nA\nHL\n also \nprovides 1,150 private rented sector (PRS) homes for use \nas temporary accommodation (TA).\n We manage these homes through a trading entity called Avenue Lettings. We lease homes from 500 individual landlords and work with 18 local authorities\n (LA\n) \nto\n provide great quality self contained homes for homeless families.  We’ve been providing this ser\nvice for over 11 years. \n&#xa0;\nAHL support the prin\nciples behind Universal Credit. We can see the Government has made\n significant progress in designing a system to help ease the transition from benefits to work. We recognise the new system will be effective for\n the majority of claimants but have concerns about some of the more vulnerable benefit claimants. We therefore welcome the opportunity to submit a response to the select committee.\n&#xa0;\nOver the next three years 70% of our residents will face significant chang\nes to their income. They’ll be managing increasingly tight budgets and we anticipate an impact on both the cost of rent collection and the amount of arrears.\n&#xa0;\n2.0Introduction&#xa0;2.1\nFor the purposes of this \nsubmission, we will focus on t\nhe following\n areas:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.0Support to residents affected by welfare reform&#xa0;3.1\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSince the welfare reform proposals, we’ve worked to ensure our residents are ready. We’ve changed our staffing structures to allow a centralised Income Team and we’ve doubled our Financial Inclusion Team from three to six. \n&#xa0;\nWe’re supporting residents thro\nugh face to face visits. We’ve discussed options and completed financial assessments. We also use text messaging for pro-active and missed payments reminders. We use facebook to update our younger customers on welfare reform changes.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.5\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.6\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.7\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.8\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.9\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.0&#xa0;\nWe’re working with residents who are under occupying properties to use mutual exchange where possible to minimise their financial risk. \nWe’ve also encouraged people who are overcrowded to contact us to help with \nthe matching exercise.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe’ve produced a suite of leaflets/guides on how to open a bank account, find a job, avoid loan sharks and reduce energy bills.\n We produce a quarterly newsletter\n, have a regular presence at resident involvement events \nand have \nalso uploaded a dvd on welfare reform to ensure residents are completely up to speed on the changes.\n&#xa0;\nOur data is crucial. We’ve actively used our \nCustomer Relationship Management (\nCRM\n)\n system to capture contact on welfare reform.\n&#xa0;\nWe’ve also made our staf\nf more accessible. Since the welfare reform changes, we’ve added 24 extra contact hours per week for customers to\n speak to an Income Officer or a Lettings Co-ordinator managing a homeless client.\n We can be contacted from 8-8 Monday to Friday and 9-1 on Sat\nurdays.\n&#xa0;\nInternally, we’ve changed our working practices to ensure greater impact. For example, we make time f\nor outbound telephone campaigns and carry out visits outside before 9am and after 5pm, as well as Saturday mornings.\n By groups of staff taking to \nthe phones together\n or visits\n, we can create a real energy and keep employees motivated.\n&#xa0;\nIn-bound calls are answered within 15 seconds and customer satisfaction with our income team\n &amp; private sector leasing team\n currently stands at 98%. \n&#xa0;\nWe’ve written ou\nt twice in the last six months to every customer who hasn’t got a bank account based on our data collection exercise. We’ve created a grid of \navailable bank accounts for staff to guide customers. We’ve also written a ‘How to Get a Bank Account’ leaflet whi\nch is sent with arrears letter\ns as well as working\n closely with a number of credit unions.\n&#xa0;\nImplications to AHL regarding service charges4.1\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.3\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.4\n&#xa0;\nWe have over 18,000 service charge payers. All are affected in some way by the introduction of Universal Credit.  \nNegative implications could affect us as landlords in two ways\n: \nCurrent legisla\ntion allows us to depreciate the cost of\n repairs and replacement of lifts\n. \nUnder revised \nDWP guidance\n this won’t continue to happen.\n The impact\n means a potential annual loss of \n£550,000\n. Service charges could be increased to cover this, but with many resid\nents affected by welfare changes, ultimately we’ll have to cover the loss through bad debt provision. This has\n an adverse effect on our business plan and therefore our ability to build new homes. \n&#xa0;\nIn some flats, particularly high rise we have responsibility for window cleaning. DWP guidance says we will not be able to charge for cleaning relating to ground floor flats. \nSignificant timely and costly work has to be undertaken for us to \nchange all lega\nl agreements with residents’\n. Without this residents will\n be paying for \nservices they don’t receive.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe guidance also fails to take account of the legal agreements with tenants, including leaseholders. These constrain the options available to both us\n and the tenant. Apportionments for charges are set out in leases and tenancy agreements.  It’s a contract to pay us charges due. So, those in flats will have to make their Universal Credit payment stretch further to cover the cost of non eligible charges \nwhich they have no choice but to receive.\n Ultimately as a landlord we’ll be at a financial loss as bad debt is incurred.\n&#xa0;\n5.0&#xa0;Implications on continued provision of TA&#xa0;5.1\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.2\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.3\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.4\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.5\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.6\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.7\nWe’ve won national customer service awards demonstrating how passionate we are about our service\n to vulnerable clients in TA\n. \n&#xa0;\n Financially it’s becoming more difficult to provide the service across all 18 areas. The changes to housing costs within the wel\nfare system remain a huge concern to the future of us being able to house vulnerable homeless clients.\nThe Government are introducing direct payments within universal credit. The main aim is to empower residents to manage money, ensuring they understand ho\nw working families budget when receiving a monthly salary. The Government tell us this will be a cost neutral exercise for them. What they haven’t considered is the full impact direct payments will have. Even though Government recognise Universal Credit mu\nst be designed to protect the financial position of landlords, d\nirect payment to tenants still means landlords will have to take unacceptable risks on collecting rent. Many landlords will not take that risk, leading to less supply in the private rented \nsec\ntor and a higher B&amp;B bill/ cost to public purse. \nConcern has already been stressed by many landlords that low income or vulnerable families will not pay rent.\n No families in temporary accommodation have been included in the UC pilots.\n If this happens ultimately these families will end up being evicted. As local authorities have a duty to find shelter for homeless families, their only option will be to place them in unsuitable and expensive B&amp;B. \n&#xa0;\nMany aspects of Welfare reform make lea\nsing temporary accommodation from the private sector no longer a financial viable option for many registered social landlords. \n&#xa0;\nThe supply of good quality temporary accommodation is reducing, especially in London &amp; the South where there’s a buoyant private\n rental market. \n&#xa0;\nThe\n direct payment element \nwill not make \nthe welfare reform policy cost neutral. Instead it will increase LA spend through \nDiscretionary Housing Payments (\nDHP\n) \nor the general fund.\n \nIf tenants do not pay their rent registered social landlo\nrds will incur higher bad debt. This will ultimately affect our credit scoring and ability to borrow/self fund in an environment where grant funding to build new affordable homes is \ndisappearing. The\n end result is registered social landlords will not build\n much needed new homes, holding back the recovery of the economy even further.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe want to continue to provide this service which our L\nA\n partners value. But proposed changes to how TA is funded are making it increasingly difficult for us to retain lease\ns and continue to provide this service. Here’s a summary of the issues:\n&#xa0;\nAll these\n issues ultimately point to an increased spend for the public purse on inappropriate bed and bedfast for vulnerable families.\n&#xa0;\n6.0&#xa0;6.1\nInnovation to support discharge of duty into PRS&#xa0;The localism act allows local authorities to discharge the duty of homelessness into the private rented sector. Again we completely support this where families can support themselves. But from our experience there are many families who require \na higher lev\nel of management to help them sustain tenancies. \nExperience also tells us many landlords require extra support to manage vulnerable client groups. Its no secret many private landlords already only accept working families.\n&#xa0;\n6.\n2\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.3\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe’ve been working with one LA to provide good quality housing from the private sector to allow them to discharge duty of homeless clients on 12 month assured short hold tenancies. The LA \nsupports\n us financially to manage the tenant, without financial detr\niment to the landlord.\n&#xa0;\nFrom year 2 the tenant has received enough support to know how to sustain their tenancy. The LA \nremoves\n financial support and we manage the letting as a private let with the owner. This removes the hassle for the landlord. Removes t\nhe problem of failing tenancies and repeated homelessness and provides a stable long term home for a family.\n6.4\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;7.0&#xa0;7.1\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThis only works with buy in and support from LA.\n A blanket approach of discharge into the PRS could lead to a ‘revolving door’ of homelessness for some families, again leading \nto a\n higher B&amp;B bill/ cost to public purse. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nRecommendations&#xa0;We reiterate that we agree in principle the aim of welfare reform /universal credit /direct payments – The \nunintended consequence of direct payments is likely to be higher costs to housing providers, negative impact on credit ratings and fewer new homes bu\nilt, as mentioned above. \n&#xa0;\nIf we and other providers are unable to continue to secure temporary accommodation, Local Authorities will have to use Bed and Breakfast accommodation more. This costs more, both to the public purse and in terms of impact on vulnerable homeless families.\n27 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n5\n&#xa0;\n"
