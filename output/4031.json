"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the International Broadcasting Trust (IBT) [FBB0035]&#xa0;&#xa0;1.  Executive Summary&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.         IBT: Background &amp; Reason for Submitting Evidence&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n 3. What should the BBC be for and what should be the purpose of public service broadcasting?&#xa0;Public service broadcasting refers to TV programmes that are broadcast for the public benefit rather than for purely commercial purposes.\n (Ofcom)\nThe BBC’s founders believed that broadcasting could make the world a better place. Public intervention would ensure that its astonishing creative power– to enrich individuals with\n knowledge, culture and information about their world, to build more cohesive communities, to engage the people of the UK and the \nwhole globe in a new conversation about who we are and where we are going – would be put to work to the sole benefit of the pu\nblic.\n4. How well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period in achieving its mission and public purposes?&#xa0;\nIn \ndeveloping (and reviewing) the purpose remit for bringing the UK to the world and the\n \nworld to the UK, the Trust must, amongst other things, seek to ensure that the BBC—\nmakes people in the UK aware of international issues and of the different cultures and viewpoints of people living outside the UK through news and current affairs and other outputs such as drama, comedy, documentaries, educational output and sports coverage; and\n \nbrings high-quality international news coverage to international audiences.\n \n5.  Are the public purposes in the current Charter the right ones? How might they change?&#xa0;6.  What scope, scale and remit should the BBC have? 7.   Should the BBC’s output and services be provided to any greater or lesser degree for particular audiences? &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n‘politicians and the public decided very early on that broadcasting should be plac\ned in the public sphere of our national life. They believed that everyone has a right to high quality broadcast services, regardless of income, age, sex, race, religion or where they live. This is why the BBC was founded according to three public principle\ns which are common to many other staples of the nation’s public life – the UK’s public health and education systems, our public parks, our museums and libraries\n.\n \n8.  What balance should be struck in what the BBC produces in-house, commissions externally and leaves entirely to others to create?&#xa0;9.   How have the BBC’s commercial activities during the current Charter fitted with the BBC’s public purposes and have they achieved an adequate return for licence fee payers? What should be the aims, scope and scale of such activities beyond 2016?10.  What role should the BBC play in developing technology and new ways of distributing content?Paying for vulnerable users to switch to digital TV appears to us to be the responsibility of government rather than the BBC. It is part of the nation’s social and cultural policy rather than a responsibility of a single broadcaster. \nNot only will other b\nroadcasters, including those with very limited public service obligations, benefit from such schemes; but it will also mean diverting licence fee income, contributed by citizens to run the BBC, rather than using general taxation, which is paid in order to \nsupport, among other things, infrastructure development and social welfare.\n&#xa0;11. How should the BBC be funded beyond 2016? &#xa0;&#xa0;\n12. Is there a case for distributing funding for public service content more widely?13. What comparisons can be made with the provision of public service content in other countries? This is \nwhy PBS, the sole American public service television\n \nbroadcaster, is a marginal broadcaster showing minority programmes in which\n \ncommercial television has no interest. It achieves a primetime viewing share of less\n \nthan 2%1. US television is essentially com\nmercial, funded either by advertising or by\n \nsubscription.\n&#xa0;\n14. How should the BBC be governed, regulated and held accountable beyond 2016?15. In a constantly evolving communications environment, does a 10-year Royal Charter and Agreement with the Secretary of State, together, provide the most appropriate constitutional framework for the BBC?IBT supports the constitutional framework of a 10-year Royal Charter and Agreement with the Secretary of State. \nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nOfcom PSB Report (2012).\n Building Public Value, 2004, BBC\n \nResearch published by YouGov this year shows a similar pattern of results when people are asked to select their preferred means of funding the BBC with 48% backing the licence fee; 27% for advertising; 13% for subscription-only; and 6% a combination of adv\nertising and subscription. \nYouGov for Prospect, 1,712 GB adults 18+, February 2013 (online survey)\n&#xa0;\n Building Public Value, BBC, 2004\n Interview in The House Magazine, 22 November 2013\n"
