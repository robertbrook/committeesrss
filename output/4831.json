"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust on behalf of The New Forest Non-Native Plants Project,&#xa0;&#xa0;Summary&#xa0;1              Brief introduction and reason for submitting evidence1.1\n              \nThis submission has been prepared by Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife \n              \nTrust on behalf of The New Forest Non-Native Plants Project. \n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nHampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust is a registered charity (number \n              \n201081) and a Company limited by guarantee and registered in England \n              \n(number 676313). \n&#xa0;\n1.3\n              \nThe New Forest Non-Native Plants Project commenced in 2009 to stop the \n              \nspread of invasive non-native plants in the New Forest area, particularly along \n              \nrivers and in wetland habitats. It is hosted by Hampshire and Isle of Wight \n              \nWildlife Trust and is supported by a partnership of organisations including the \n              \nForestry Commission, Environment Agency, Natural England and the New \n              \nForest National Park Authority. \n&#xa0;\n1.4\n              \nHampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust welcomes the opportunity to submit \n              \nwritten evidence to the Inquiry. The New Forest Non-Native Plants Project \n              \ncontributes to the implementation of The Invasive Non-Native Species \n              \nFramework \n              \nStrategy for Great Britain (DEFRA, 2008) through a) control and \n              \neradication of invasive non-native plants, b) building awareness and \n              \n              \nunderstanding of the problems caused by invasive non-native species and c) \n              \ncommissioning research into the impact of invasive non-native plants and \n              \nnovel methods of control. As recognised by the Framework Strategy, \n              \n              \nsuccessful implementation relies on a ‘strong partnership approach’ with \n              \nlandowners; the New Forest Non-Native Plants Project has established strong \n              \nlinks with landowners but progress towards eradication of invasive non-native \n              \nplants at the catchment scale is being hampered by the inability to ascertain \n              \nthe ownership of certain areas of land. \n&#xa0;\n1.5\n              \nHampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust wishes to draw the Inquiry’s \n              \nattention to the Law Commission’s review of Wildlife Law, in particular the \n              \nproposal to introduce powers to make species control orders. We consider \n              \nthat the introduction of species control orders, in particular in situations where \n              \nthe name and address of the land owner can not be ascertained, would be of \n              \nsignificant benefit to the control and eradication of invasive non-native \n              \nspecies.\n&#xa0;2              Evidence submitted by Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust2.1\n              \nWe note that the Inquiry will examine ‘the case for any change in the law \n              \nregarding invasive species’ and ‘any lessons for England and Wales from the \n              \nexperience of Scotland’s invasive species legislation and controls’. \n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nHampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust considers that changes in \n              \nlegislation are required to enable invasive non-native species to be \n              \nsuccessfully controlled and eradicated at the catchment scale. \n&#xa0;\n2.3\n              \nIt is an offence under Section 14(2) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 to \n              \n‘plant or otherwise cause to grow in the wild’ any plant listed in Part II of \n              \nSchedule 9 of this Act. Although Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust \n              \nrecognises that responsibility therefore rests with riparian landowners to stop \n              \nthe spread of plants listed in Schedule 9, we consider that landowners need \n              \nadvice, encouragement and practical help to enable invasive non-native plants \n              \nto be successfully eradicated at the catchment scale.  The New Forest Non-\n              \nNative Plants Project was therefore set up to liaise with landowners and offer \n              \nadvice and practical help to control relevant invasive non-native species along \n              \nriver valleys and in wetland habitats in the New Forest area.\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n              \nSince the start of The New Forest Non-Native Plants Project in 2009, the \n              \nProject Officer has identified riparian owners along relevant watercourses to \n              \noffer advice and help with the control of invasive non-native species, for \n              \nexample giant hogweed and Himalayan balsam. The vast majority of \n              \nlandowners have co-operated with the Project Officer, recognised the need \n              \nfor the control of invasive non-native species on their land and have \n              \nunderstood the importance of a ‘joined-up’ approach with neighbouring \n              \nlandowners to tackle the spread of invasive non-native plants at the catchment \n              \nscale. \n&#xa0;\n2.5\n              \nHowever, in a minority of cases, the Project Officer has been unable to identify \n              \nthe owner(s) of the land, despite extensive research. The inability to identify \n              \nthe current landowner of even a single parcel of land presents a challenge to \n              \nsuccessful eradication at the catchment scale, as seed from plants growing on \n              \nthis land can fall into the adjacent watercourse and be carried downstream to \n              \nre-infest areas where landowners, contractors and volunteers have worked \n              \nhard to control the invasive species. \n&#xa0;\n2.6\n              \nDuring 2012 the Law Commission undertook a consultation exercise in \n              \nrelation to its review of wildlife law. Chapter 8 of the consultation document \n              \n(Law Commission Consultation Paper No 206) considered the control of \n              \ninvasive non-native species and included Provisional Proposal 8-7 for ‘the \n              \npower to make species control orders on the same model as under the Wildlife \n              \nand Natural Environment (Scotland) Act 2011’.\n&#xa0;\n2.7\n              \nHampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust fully supported this Provisional \n              \nProposal in our response to the Law Commission dated 8 November 2012. \n              \nWe welcomed the proposal for species control orders to require a person to \n              \ndestroy invasive non-native species on their property. We welcomed the \n              \nintroduction of species control orders which can permit a person to enter land \n              \nwithout the need for permission from the owner or occupier (normally with 14 \n              \ndays notice) to carry out operations required by the order. We welcomed the \n              \nproposal for emergency species control orders which would permit a person to \n              \nenter land to undertake work without the need to give the owner or occupier \n              \n14 days notice. \n&#xa0;\n2.8\n              \nIn our response to the Law Commission’s consultation, we pointed out that \n              \none of the major problems currently facing the New Forest Non-Native Plants \n              \nProject is how to deal with invasive non-native species on land where the \n              \nowner can not be traced. We cited the example of the Cadnam River where \n              \nwe are helping landowners to eradicate the Schedule 9 plant called Himalayan \n              \nbalsam but where the owner of one parcel of land can not be identified, \n              \ndespite extensive research involving \ninter alia\n Land Registry searches, \n              \ninterviews with neighbouring landowners, correspondence with the son of a \n              \nprevious owner, correspondence with the Highways Agency who once owned \n              \nthe land and discussions with local residents. We have therefore been unable \n              \nto tackle the Himalayan balsam on this parcel of land and are acutely \n              \nconscious that all the effort/time/resources being expended further \n              \ndownstream is being jeopardised by the seeds being shed from plants growing \n              \non this particular parcel of land. \n&#xa0;\n2.9 \n              \nWe were therefore very encouraged to note that (in paragraph 8.76 of the Law \n              \nCommission Consultation Paper No 206) ‘a species control order can be \n              \nmade by statutory notice if the relevant body is unable to ascertain the name \n              \nand address of any owner or occupier’. We would strongly welcome the \n              \nintroduction of species control orders which can be imposed on land where the \n              \nownership can not be ascertained. \n&#xa0;3              Recommendations for action3.1\n              \nFollowing the Law Commission’s consultation exercise during 2012 (Law \n              \nCommission Consultation Paper No 206), a Wildlife Law Interim Statement (15 \n              \nOctober 2013) has been published which sets out the Law Commission’s \n              \nconclusions in advance of it drafting legislation. The Interim Statement \n              \nrecommends (paragraph 1.83) the introduction of species control orders in \n              \nEngland and Wales. \n/Con\n3.2\n              \nHampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust asks the Environmental Audit \n              \nCommittee to consider endorsing the Law Commission’s recommendation for \n              \nthe introduction of species control orders in England and Wales. The \n              \nintroduction of species control orders would allow entry onto land in order to \n              \ncontrol an invasive non-native species and would be of particular benefit \n              \nwhere the relevant body is unable to ascertain the name and address of any \n              \nowner or occupier.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nWe consider the introduction of species control orders would significantly \n              \ncontribute to the successful control and eradication of invasive non-native \n              \nplants at the catchment scale, thereby furthering the implementation of the \n              \nInvasive Non-Native \nSpecies Framework Strategy for Great Britain.\n&#xa0;\n7 January 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
