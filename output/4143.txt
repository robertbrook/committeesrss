[[[Summary]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;1.              Introduction&#xa0;1.1              I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the Committee’s inquiry into Parliament’s Ombudsman Service and to share with the Committee my experiences as Northern Ireland Ombudsman.&#xa0;1.2              I currently hold two statutory offices, that of Assembly Ombudsman for Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Complaints.  I have held both offices since September 2000.  In my role as Assembly Ombudsman, I have the authority to investigate complaints of maladministration made against Northern Ireland Departments and their statutory agencies.  As Northern Ireland Commissioner for Complaints, I have the authority to investigate complaints of maladministration about local authorities, housing, health and social care bodies and a wide range of arms length authorities including a number of justice bodies in Northern Ireland.  In addition, a number of statutory regulatory bodies are within my jurisdiction; these include the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Children and Young Persons Commissioner, and the Commissioner for Older People for Northern Ireland.&#xa0;              Like the current PHSO, I have a jurisdiction in respect of health complaints which also allows me to examine the clinical judgement of health professionals including general health service providers and independent health service providers.  Because health and social care are provided as an integrated service in Northern Ireland, I can investigate cases across the full spectrum of health and social care.&#xa0;1.3               Throughout my time as Northern Ireland Ombudsman, I have seen a steady increase in citizen’s accessing my office to seek redress for injustice resulting from the administrative failure of bodies in my jurisdiction.  In particular, in the first six months of this financial year, complaints to my office overall have increased by 31% and within this the health jurisdiction figure has seen an increase of over 35%.&#xa0;1.4               The citizen can complain to my office at any point in their service journey but I normally expect the complainant to have exhausted the complaints process of the body that has provided the service before bringing a complaint to me.  This approach confirms the role of my office as the office of last resort in respect of citizen’s complaints particularly where they relate to poor administration.  Currently, as happens with the PHSO, there is a filter for complaints to my office in my role as Assembly Ombudsman where an individual is alleging maladministration by Government Departments and their agencies.  This filter requires that the complainant secures sponsorship of their complaint by a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly.  It is probable that this barrier will be removed if the legislative changes that are currently being proposed by the OFMdFM Committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly are implemented.&#xa0;2.              The Landscape of Ombudsmen and Complaint Handlers in the UK&#xa0;2.1              The landscape of ombudsmen and complaint handlers in the UK dealing with complaints about public services and consumer grievances is, in my view, crowded.  This often can be confusing for the citizen who seeks redress for injustice.  In order to refine the redress landscape, the devolved governments in Scotland and Wales consulted on the roles and remit of various ombudsmen schemes in those countries. As a result a single office of Public Services Ombudsman was created in Scotland in 2002 and in Wales in 2005 in order to deal with complaints of maladministration about those devolved bodies who deliver public services.  &#xa0;2.2              This ‘one stop shop model’ for complaints about public administration has, in essence, been in existence in Northern Ireland since 1969 with the creation of the statutory offices of Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration for Northern Ireland and Northern Ireland Commissioner for Complaints. While these offices were rebranded in 1996, as Assembly Ombudsman for Northern Ireland and Northern Ireland Commissioner for Complaints respectively, they have, since their inception ( with one exception),  been held by the same ombudsman with staff investigating complaints spanning central and local government, health and social care, housing and other public services across both statutory remits.. An independent review of the office by Deloitte in 2004 recommended legislation to merge these statutory offices. When enacted this will give legal effect to the devolved ombudsman model of a one stop shop for complaints about local public services.  The development of legislative proposals for that single office, to be known as the Northern Ireland Public Services Ombudsman (NIPSO) has been undertaken by the OFMdFM Committee and this legislation will be introduced into the Assembly in early 2014.  While the specific provisions are still to be drafted, debated and scrutinised, I welcome the OFMdFM Committee’s particular contribution and commitment to introducing this legislation which will modernise my Office and provide greater access for citizens to remedy and redress when public services in Northern Ireland fail them.&#xa0;3.              Access to Parliament’s Ombudsman Service&#xa0;3.1              To ensure that all citizens have direct access to an ombudsman, having exhausted the internal complaints procedure of bodies, it is important that any barriers to accessibility to further redress are removed.  Sponsorship by a Member of Parliament or members of a Legislative Assembly should not, in my view, be a requirement in bringing a complaint to an ombudsman.  The ‘twin-track approach’ as proposed by the Law Commission for England and Wales would ensure that the citizen who wishes to complain has, if he or she so chooses, the support of their MP or MLA in bringing a complaint to an ombudsman.  This would also help maintain that vital link between the legislature and the Ombudsman which is necessary to ensure that Government departments and public bodies are held to account for the quality and delivery of public services.  The Committee may also wish to note the development of monthly bulletins and case digests in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland that offer an alternative means of keeping elected members updated about the nature, number and source of cases and complaints being raised by citizens.&#xa0;3.2              In Scotland and Wales, the ‘filter’ has already been removed in relation to complaints about central government departments.  In Northern Ireland, I am on record as asking for the removal of the MLA filter in relation to complaints about Northern Ireland   Departments.  In my role as Northern Ireland Commissioner for Complaints dealing with health and social care, local government and public services, no such requirement exists.  This dichotomy between the two regimes is confusing for the public who seek to access my office.  I therefore welcome the policy proposal of the OFMdFM Committee to replace the MLA filter with the ‘twin track approach’.  &#xa0;4.              Ombudsmen and Powers of Own Initiative&#xa0;4.1              In the UK, an Ombudsman model has developed which is dependent on the citizen pursuing a complaint.  This is not the model which has developed internationally where organisations such as the European Ombudsman, have the power to commence an investigation without first receiving a complaint from a citizen.  In the Republic of Ireland, the Ombudsman has discretion to commence such an investigation and this has been used sparingly but to significant effect.  The value of an ‘own-initiative’ power is that it can deliver systemic improvements for a greater number of citizens and not just the complainant in a particular case.&#xa0;4.2              The Deloitte Review recommended that the NIPSO have a power to commence an investigation where there is evidence of systemic maladministration.  I am pleased to note that the OFMdFM policy proposals provide for such a power in the proposed NIPSO legislation.&#xa0;5.              The Reformed Ombudsman’s Office Relationship with Parliament’s Select Committees&#xa0;5.1              Public Services ombudsmen exist to provide a service for the citizen, the wider public and Parliament itself.   They play a unique role in reflecting to Parliament the concerns of the ‘governed’ about the services overseen and provided by Government.  It is important therefore that Public Services ombudsmen have a mechanism for bringing the results of their investigations to the attention of a Parliament or legislative Assembly.  I currently produce periodic case digests and an annual report which I lay before the Northern Ireland Assembly.  The Assembly’s response has been that the relevant Select Committee has invited me to give evidence of the issues raised in these reports.  For instance, I have given evidence to the Committee for the Environment on issues arising from complaints to my Office about the planning service and the Committee for Finance and Personnel about complaints relating to public procurement.  I welcome this opportunity to inform the relevant Select Committee about the results of my investigations which may assist a Committee’s deliberations and considerations of related issues, by providing a real time and, importantly, independent perspective on the citizen’s experience of public services.&#xa0;5.2              The role of informing Parliament of the overall outcome and findings of the Ombudsman across his/her range of investigations should be undertaken by a separate Select Committee from the Committee that is scrutinising the financial and administrative performance of the Ombudsman’s office. Scrutiny of an ombudsman’s performance by a single Select Committee is a necessary role to ensure that the service is operating effectively and efficiently, and is providing an appropriate, proper account of the guardianship of his/her remit and expenditure.  I currently do not report directly to a specific Committee in relation to this separate aspect of my role.   However, it is proposed that the financial performance of the new NIPSO be subject to the scrutiny by the Audit Committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly.  &#xa0;6.              The Role of a Complaints Standards Authority&#xa0;6.1              The establishment of a Complaints Standards Authority was debated by the OFMdFM Committee when considering the policy framework that would inform its approach to the proposed NIPSO Bill.  The Committee considered this was not an appropriate role for the NIPSO and after due consideration, I have accepted this view.  A different model has emerged in Northern Ireland to ensure a standardised approach to complaints handling in our jurisdiction.  In 2009, I published guidance on standards for effective complaint handling.  I am pleased to note that these standards have been adopted by the interdepartmental group on complaints handling convened by the Permanent Secretary Group for Northern Ireland (PSG).  As a result, the following recommendations of that interdepartmental group are being implemented as follows:&#xa0;&#xa0;I welcome this initiative and my office will continue to engage with the PSG and the interdepartmental group members to assist in these significant innovations in the complaint handling of public bodies in Northern Ireland.&#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0; Emily O’Reilly’s evidence to OFMDFM Committee on 15 June 2011  Rights, Responsibilities and Redress
