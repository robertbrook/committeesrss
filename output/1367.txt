[[[Linkage Community Trust]]]

[[[Summary]]]Although Linkage Community Trust are not aware of any of our own service users being particularly affected by housing costs in the reformed welfare system, we are conscious that the impacts on vulnerable people with learning disabilities and their families who live in social housing are being felt far and wide across the country.We have become aware of several initiatives which are being used to support vulnerable people to afford to stay in their homes. These initiatives are outlined in more detail in our full response. They clearly highlight the resistance from front-line workers and Local Authorities to the incoming welfare changes, which are seemingly proving more costly to implement and enforce than the previous system. &#xa0;

[[[ authority funding mechanisms]]]1.1. We have been made aware that some social workers with real initiative have found a way round some of the social sector size criteria issues. Under the charging system for social care people are assessed as to whether they need to make a contribution towards the service under the Fair Access to Care Services criteria (FACS).   Any service user who receives housing benefit and has a bedroom supplement to pay, i.e. the housing benefit is less than the rent so the tenant has to pay the difference, can have the top-up amount set against the Local Authority financial assessment. This reduces the contribution they have to make because it should reduce their fairer charge by the same amount as the top-up. They are able to calculate the top-up and then ask the finance department at the Local Authority for this to be taken into account. &#xa0;

[[[Social sector size criteria]]]2.1. We are aware that some Local Authorities are taking another approach. For example, if two people are living in three bedroom social housing accommodation, the Local Authority has re-designated one room as a study. This is because the Local Authority has decided that the cost of rehousing would be greater than finding a way round the social sector size criteria or ‘bedroom tax’.  &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[3. Our own experiences]]]3.1 Linkage Community Trust had one service user who moved into a 2-bedroom property in February 2013 as he required sleep-in staff due to his needs. The recent changes to housing benefits may have affected him but, due to staff incurring extra utility costs, Linkage only charged this service user the 1-bedroom rent fee to compensate this.Although most of our service users live in 1-bedroom properties, we are anticipating that those service users in 2-bed accommodation may be affected by the changes to housing-related benefits in the near future as they are re-assessed for housing benefits. This is because their current housing benefits applications are historical.&#xa0;23 August 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
