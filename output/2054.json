"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten e\nvidence from Chris \nBazlinton\n (SLC 012)\n&#xa0;\n1. SUMMARY\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI would be happy to expand on any of the points made.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1. Was there a cover up? Withholding of evidence&#xa0;\n1.1 \nThroughout, Network Rail and others have gone out of their way to deny there was any cover up.  But there has never been any investigation or internal inquiry to determine one way or another.  In some ways, the events suggest more of a conspiracy of silenc\ne.  This revolves round two main documents – Part B \n(which suggested in 2002 that locking the gates at \nElsenham\n should be considered) \nand the \nHudd\n memo\n written in 2001\n (which \ndrew\n \nattention\n \nto\n \nthe\n \ndangers\n \nof\n \nthe\n \ncrossing\n “\n…\nthe\n \nrisk\n \nof\n \ndisaster\n \nis\n \nreal\n” \n….\n \n“\nirresistible...\n \ntemptation\n” \nto\n \ncross\n \nexactly\n \nas\n \nthe\n \ngirls\n \nhad\n \ndone\n,\n \nthereby\n \npredicting\n \nthe\n \naccident\n \nthat\n \nkilled\n \nthe girls)\n.\n \n Neither of these docu\nment\ns appeared until 2011. \n If \nit was \nnot a\n cover-up or co\nnspiracy of silence, the facts suggest massive \nincompetence\n and failure by officials to \ndiscover the background to\n what happened\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.2 \nClearly given the culpability of Network Rail, the successful prosecution by ORR and subsequent sentence, some officials failed in their responsibilities but none have \nbeen held accountable or suffered any consequences of that failure.\n  None have been publicly questioned about their role or knowledge, except as it related to the ORR investigation which led to the prosecution of Network Rail as an entity, but not any indi\nviduals.\n&#xa0;\n1.3 \nThe existence of \nPart B and the \nHudd\n memo\n was revealed by Mo \nRos\nse\n in 2010\n who said \nit had been her responsibility to send all relevant documents \nto\n \nNetwork Rail’s Legal Department\n, shortly after the accident.  \nShe has been adamant\n \nthat\n Part B and the \nHudd\n memo\n, were included\n. \n \nHowever, her computer was \nlater \nwiped and no evidence exists.  \nWhat makes her evidence so important is that without it, the families would not have known or followed up their inquiries\n, and the information would h\nave never become public.\n&#xa0;\n1.4 \nOther officials who were involved include J\no Green, then Route Production Manager when she received the \nHudd\n memo.  She told ORR that she could not remember receiving the memo.\n&#xa0;\n1.5 \nAnother was Philip Heath, at the time of the\n accident General Manager for West Anglia.  He prepared a witness statement for the civil case brought by the parents against Network Rail.  This statement was never used as Network Rail conceded the case.  However, it was placed on the Network Rail websit\ne in February as a press statement just as \nThe Times\n revealed the existence of Part B.  It disappeared days later.  In it Philip Heath stated that \nhe was not aware of any other serious incidents or problems at \nElsenham\n until the accident on 3 December 2005\n.  In July 2010 at the time of the civil case he asked Mo \nRosse\n, who was suspended at the time, whether she had any documents relating to \nElsenham\n: she didn’t.\n&#xa0;\n1.6 \nAmong other officials who have never been questioned\n publicly\n about their role in the matte\nr are Robin \nGisby\n, Managing Director Network Operations, and Richard Smith, Solicitor for Network Rail though whom all documents would have passed\n, and Jon Wiseman, then Route Director for East Anglia\n \n \n(\nwho later reported directly to Robin \nGisby\n)\n, and\n sinc\ne retired\n (he was questioned at the \nIn\nquest but did not reveal the existence of part B and the \nHudd\n memo).\n  It is clear that Richard Smith knew about the \ndocuments before they appeared in \nThe Times\n: \nwe know this\n \nas a result of evidence provided through a F\nreedom of Information disclosure by ORR.  Yet the \nHudd\n document was \nstill \nwithheld until ORR announced it was going to visit Network Rail to look through files in May 2011.  It was handed to them the same afternoon and issued to the families by Chief Execu\ntive David Higgins \nthat day\n.  No action has been taken about this withholding of information.  \n&#xa0;\n1.7  \nThe first inquiry was carried out by the industry’s Rail Safety Standards Board (RSSB) which in 2011 admitted it had seen Part B (though not the \nHudd\n memo\n).  However, the RSSB’s report never mentioned Part B.\n&#xa0;\n1.8  \nNeither Part B nor the \nHudd\n memo were among the \nevidence presented among the documents issued \nin connection with\n the Inquest.\n&#xa0;\n2. The Inquest&#xa0;\n2.1 \nAt a pre Inquest hearing and subsequently, \nNetwork Rail and the train companies made representations that risk assessment evidence should not be given.  During the Inquest one of their b\narristers raised the issue and persuaded the Coroner to ensure\n that this evidence was not considered.\n&#xa0;\n2.2 \nAmong \nthe documents\n which were excluded was one by Iain Ferguson of the Health and Safety Executive.  He concluded that a risk assessment held in 2005 was inadequate in that it did not adequately address the consequences of someone stepping in front of a train, \nand that the crossing was not compliant with a section of the Requirements for Level Crossings.  He concluded:  “\nI would not consider Network Rail’s assessment methodologies… to be suitable and sufficient\n”.\n&#xa0;\n2.3 \nInquests are not supposed to be confrontatio\nnal, but the way in which Network \nR\nail in particular used legal devices to exclude such evidence left us as families deeply unhappy that we had been\n cheated and\n treated \nunfairly.  That feeling rankles even more now that we know that vital and relevant d\nocu\nment\ns were withheld by Network Rail.\n&#xa0;\n3. Failures in risk assessment&#xa0;\n3.1  \nI have made a few comments about the failures of Network Rail’s risk assessment but \nthis issue has\n been covered\n at length \n by the RAIB\n,\n HSE and others.  Suffice it to say, \nit was \nrevealed that the assess\nments carried out at \nElsenham\n were seriously flawed but it took until 2011 before any real action was taken. \n&#xa0;\n3.2  \nSafety assessments have improved but there has been too much reliance on rigid statistical methods, as witnessed by \nfaulty assessments at \nElsensham\n on a number of oc\nc\nasions.  I believe greater relianc\ne on commonsense and human judg\nment would improve matters – in both cases where the true dangers were revealed (by \nHudd\n and Hill) it was down to basic observation, not math\nematical formulae. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4. Johnson’s Crossing&#xa0;\n4.1 \nThe lack of proper investigation and  accountability has also been the case following the death of Katie \nLittlewood\n at Johnsons Crossing which ironically happened days before Network Rail pleaded guilty o\nver the \nElsenham\n deaths.\n&#xa0;\n4.2 \nThe RAIB investigation into this case revealed \nimportant failings by Network Rail.  \nIt\n revealed: “\nBetween 1996 and 2007, there had been a series of suggestions and proposals to divert pedestrians away from Johnson’s footpath c\nrossing or to replace the crossing with a bridge.\n \nThe RAIB has been una\nble to establish fully why none \nof\n these proposals \nfrom were progressed\n” and “\nNetwork Rail did not follow-up a proposal in 2007 to install a footbridge\n \nto replace Johnson’s footpath \ncrossing, after analysis had shown that the\n \nbenefits of so doing would exceed the costs\n”.\n&#xa0;\n4.3  \nThe report also revealed: \n“\nA tracking\n \nsheet used by the Anglia operational risk team recorded that a submission had\n \nbeen made for funding by November 2008. A ke\ny witness has reported that this\n \nsubmission \n [for funding] \nwas rejected, although the RAIB has not seen any documentary\n \nevidence of this. Neither the former Route Operations Manager nor the former\n \nRoute Enhancements Manager (who would normally have applied\n for funding,\n..\n) could recall a proposal for a bridge or find any\n \nrecord that a funding submission had in fact been made\n”\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.4 It is clear that had Network R\nail acted as it should have done, Katie \nLittlewood\n would not have died at the crossing.\n&#xa0;\n4.5  \nAgai\nn no internal investigation has taken place to determine what went wrong and who was responsible.  The \nORR \nhas\n,\n \nunfortunately, \ntaken no action to prosecute Network Rail in this case.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5. Improving safety at level crossings: reducing risk&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1 \nEvidence shows that for a variety of reasons, pedestrians and drivers take risks at level crossings.  Ways need to be found to make it near impossible to encroach on rail lines, and \nthere should be \ngreater use of modern technology for distance control of c\nrossing at more remote locations.\n  The default position should be that all gates at all crossings are locked when trains are passing through.  All crossings should be gated with half barriers replaced by full barriers in all cases to deter drivers and pede\nstrians from circumventing gates.\n&#xa0;\n5.2 \nThere appears to be a long held policy within Network Rail that pedestrian gates cannot be locked on some crossings. While there are other problems that can arise unless gates are locked there will continue to be fata\nl accidents.  The point has often been made that locking gates can result in pedestrian being trapped.  One solution to that is to incorporate ‘safe’ areas between locked gates and the track itself.  At \nElsenham\n before the accident such ‘safe’ areas – more\n than one \nmetre\n square, sufficient to take two pedestrians and a pram or buggy – existed.  Yet officials at the time refused to accept \nthat this was the purpose of these areas, arguing instead for unlocked gates so that pedestrians pass through if caught \ni\nn the track area \nbetween the gates.\n&#xa0;\n5.3  \nAnother argument is that gates can only be locked if there are gate keepers in attendance.  (At \nElsenham\n, the gatekeepers had only limited responsibility for observing the crossing).  However, advances in modern \ntechnology (both in what it can achieve and price) are such that it should be p\nossible to lock p\nedestrian \ngates \nfrom central locations\n, and\n us\ne\n CCTV and interactive audio\n and video\n to allow officials\n, train drivers\n and pedestrians to communicate.  \nUse of s\nuch devices could mean gates at little used crossings could be locked until opening is requested by pedestrians.\n&#xa0;\n5.4  \nIt would also be beneficial to include \nLDC/LED displays to inform pedestrians of when the next train is due, where the approaching train \nis and how long it will be before the gates are released.  Such displays are now ubiquitous at stations to inform passengers of train arrivals – this is partly a result of the huge reduction in cost of such systems.  These displays could also be included c\nould also be a service to \nvehicle drivers at\n crossings and thus help reduce frustration: informed drivers and pedestrians are less likely to take any precipitate or potentially risky actions such as attempting to cross the line.\n&#xa0;\nSeptem\nber 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
