[normal]Written evidence submitted by [bold]ADCS [bold]The Association of Directors of Children's Services 
[normal](ADCS) 
[normal]values the
[normal] opportunity to respond to the c
[normal]all for evidence by the Education 
[normal]Select Committee on the Ofsted Social Care Annual Report 2012 – 1
[normal]3
[normal].  
[normal]ADCS is the professional association for directors of children's services an
[normal]d their senior management teams.
[normal] 
[normal]Under the Children Act 2004, the DCS
[normal] 
[normal]is
[normal] the 
[normal]chief
[normal] officer responsible for the 
[normal]discharge of local authority functions for children’s social care
[normal]. T
[normal]he DCS provides a clear and unambiguous line of 
[normal]professional
[normal] accountability for children’s services as well
[normal] being 
[normal]professional
[normal]ly responsible
[normal] for the leadership, strategy and effectiveness of local authority children’s services and, as such, has a particular interest in the 
[normal]publication of the Ofsted Social Care Annual Report. 
[normal]ADCS 
[normal]believe
[normal]s
[normal] that inspection
[normal], by Ofsted
[normal], of the local authority, has
[normal] the potential to be helpful
[normal] if it supports improvement in outcomes f
[normal]or children and their families and 
[normal]our response is set in this context.
[normal]2012 – 13 was the first year that the Ofsted Annual Report has been split into two separate publications, one encom
[normal]passing 
[normal]social care exclusively and another, published in early December 2013, focusing predominantly on the education aspect of Ofsted’s remit. It is not clear what benefit this brings to the workforce
[normal] or the public
[normal], but the publication of two reports 
[normal]sep
[normal]arating the local authority’s work in respect of children’s social care from that of its role in quality assuring  school standards
[normal], does not reflect the co-dependencies that exist
[normal] 
[normal]when improving outcomes for children and young people.
[normal]A
[normal]DCS welcomes Ofsted
[normal]’s focus on improving standards in children’s social care. All directors of children’s services
[normal], whether their services have been judged
[normal] by Ofs
[normal]t
[normal]ed
[normal] to be 
[normal]‘
[normal]outstanding
[normal]’
[normal] or 
[normal]‘
[normal]inadequate
[normal]’
[normal], are committed to improving services for the children in their local area. 
[normal]On publication of the Ofsted Annual Report, Sir Michael
[normal] Wilshaw
[normal] called for 
[normal]“strong and stable leadership to bring about sustained improvement in the help
[normal],
[normal] care and protection of ou
[normal]r most vulnerable young people”, ADCS agrees with this laudable aim and acknowledges the crucial 
[normal]role of
[normal] strong and stable leadership teams, not exclusively the director of children’s services but also the wider management team
[normal],
[normal] in delivering good, sustain
[normal]able services. Yet 
[normal]Ofsted's approach to inspection, namely the single word judgment, is not conducive to 
[normal]leadership stability
[normal]. A judgment of inadequate
[normal] after the inspection of local authority children’s services
[normal], and the subsequent instability this can cau
[normal]se, can be detrimental to the improvement journey of a local authority.
[normal] In one local authority, the vacancy rate amongst children’s social workers 
[normal]increased from 4% to 40% after a judgment of “inadequate”. Other children’s services departments, such as Bir
[normal]mingham City Council, 
[normal]have publically stated the impact that staff 
[normal]vacancies has had when trying to improve their service. 
[normal]A 
[normal]move to 
[normal]narrative judgment
[normal]s, as opposed to a single word judgment,
[normal] would allow local authorities to work with their local partner
[normal]s
[normal],
[normal] including health, police and education
[normal], in a less punitive environment
[normal] to form an action plan to  i
[normal]mprove
[normal] services
[normal] in their local area. 
[normal]Helping, protecting and caring for vulnerable children, young people and their families is a complex multi agency 
[normal]business that is not eased by the febrile climate that children’s services leaders sometimes find themselves in during the immediate aftermath of an ‘inadequate’ inspection judgment.
