defaultExamples, research and litigationdefaultWhether or not an asylum seeker as a determinant of legal aid
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultCase study:default Mr A was assisted by a legal aid solicitor in making his application for support as well as his asylum claim. The Home Office had refused his application for support on the basis that they did not believe he had ever claimed asylum in the UK. His case was
default complicated because he had initially come to the UK through a third country to which he had been removed in 2006. But he had returned to the UK at some point and claimed asylum. Although the Home Office disputed this, he was able to show he had been inter
defaultviewed by the Home Office and had yet to receive a decision on his claim. The Tribunal judge found that he was an asylum seeker and he was granted support. 
defaultCase study: defaultMr H had submitted further submissions to the Home Office following the refusal of his asylum claim. The Home Office rejected these saying they did not amount to a fresh claim for asylum. His solicitors then issued a Judicial Review which was settled by Co
defaultnsent Order. The Order made it clear that the Home Office had agreed to reconsider his fresh claim as an asylum claim. However, when he applied for support his application was refused on the basis that he was not an asylum seeker as his further submissions
default were still pending. It emerged in his support appeal that the Home Office caseworker had interpreted the Consent Order to mean that they were merely going to reconsider the further submissions, not that they had agreed they amounted to a new asylum claim.
default He won his appeal for support. 
defaultCase studydefault: Mr B’s 
defaultapplication had been refused on the grounds that it was not belie
defaultved he had an outstanding case.  However
default, he had recently obtained permission to have his case considered by the Court of Appeal following 
defaultthe Home Office’s refusal of his fresh claim. He had been released from immigration detention but shortly after was admitted to a psychiatric ward as he suffered from serious mental health problems. He was thought to be at risk of suicide and suffered from
default Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. He was sleeping in parks at the time of his support appeal.
default He won his appeal and was given support.

defaultConnection to the UK
default as a determinant of legal aid
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultCase study: defaultMs B arrived in the UK 14 years ago and claimed asylum. In 2009 she submitted a fresh claim to the Home Office which was still outstanding when we met her. Given the delay in considering her fresh claim, she had been granted permission to work and had take
defaultn up a job as a care worker, paying taxes in the UK. In June 2012 following a change in policy the Home Office restricted the work she could do to the shortage occupation list. She lost her job. As she was not qualified to carry out any of the jobs on the 
defaultoccupation list she has not been able to work since then and is now in receipt of asylum support.  
default&#xa0;
defaultCase study:default Mr M has been in the UK for 12 years. He now has two young children who are settled in the UK, one of whom is British. Although he does not live with his children he has regular contact with them and takes an active role in their upbringing. When we met h
defaultim he was in the process of preparing a further application to the Home Office on the basis of this established family life.

defaultCase study: defaultThe particular difficulties these individuals will experience when trying to leave the UK is highlighted by the case 
defaultof Mr A, who is a 
defaultBidoon
default from Kuwait.   In common with many Kuwaiti 
defaultBidoons
default, Mr A and his family had lived Kuwait for many years but never acquired Kuwaiti citizenship.   Whilst in UK he had approached the Kuwaiti embassy several times to try and obtain do
defaultcuments to return but these were refused on the basis that he was not a national of Kuwait.  Following a decision by the Tribunal to refuse him support on the basis that he was not taking enough steps to return, we referred his case to a solicitor.   Durin
defaultg the process of the judicial review, the Treasury Solicitor settled and agreed to grant him support and to backdate this to the day of his appeal hearing.  
defaultCase Study: defaultThis is illustrated by the case of Mr B who, following a successful appeal, was offere
defaultd accommodation in Wales.   However, his partner and two young children were housed in London which would have severely limited the contact he could have with them.   The solicitors issued a letter before claim, pointing out Home Office’s duties to promote
default the welfare of children and also their obligations to preserve family life as far as possible.  Following the letter, UKBA agreed to house Mr B close to his family in London thus ensuring he had sufficient contact with his partner and children.

defaulted there was a safe route, so he no longer qualified under (c) and instead needed to show he was taking all reasonable steps (a).  Issue was whether the Tribunal could consider for itself issue of whether safe route of return, or, alternatively, allow appe

defaultPara 26 as to the ‘availability of judicial review

default&#xa0;
default[2004] EWHC 1806
defaultIssue of what counts as fresh claim so as to trigger entitlement to 
defaultsupport (so crucial to the proposals as the same ‘threshold’ is being used to decide entitlement to legal aid, 3.58). By time of full hearing of JR took place, the SSHD had accepted it as a fresh claim but Mr Justice Collins decided issue of importance so 
defaultshould proc
defaulteed.  N 
defaulthad attempted to apply for support, but NASS refused it although they acknowledged that the HO had received his fresh claim (applications for s4 support prior to 2005 did not lead to an appeal and so JR was the only remedy here).  Judgme
defaultnt quotes Bingham in CA in 
defaultOnibiyo
default 1996 on why the Refugee Convention must allow for fresh claims, and what test should be to qualify as one (new material etc) and that if it is a fresh claim, then there must be a right of appeal. And that JR is the correc
defaultt remedy to use to compel the SSHD, if he errs, to accept it as a fresh claim. But therefore making a fresh claim and it being accepted as one are 2 separate stages, and only the latter triggers entitlement to s95 support
default&#xa0;

defaultCase contains essential 
defaultguidance to both sides on when a ‘fresh claim’ is made, and therefore when asylum support (s95 or s4) becomes available.
