[normal]Examples, research and litigation[bold]Whether or not an asylum seeker as a determinant of legal aid
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Case study:[bold] Mr A was assisted by a legal aid solicitor in making his application for support as well as his asylum claim. The Home Office had refused his application for support on the basis that they did not believe he had ever claimed asylum in the UK. His case was
[normal] complicated because he had initially come to the UK through a third country to which he had been removed in 2006. But he had returned to the UK at some point and claimed asylum. Although the Home Office disputed this, he was able to show he had been inter
[normal]viewed by the Home Office and had yet to receive a decision on his claim. The Tribunal judge found that he was an asylum seeker and he was granted support. 
[normal]Case study: [bold]Mr H had submitted further submissions to the Home Office following the refusal of his asylum claim. The Home Office rejected these saying they did not amount to a fresh claim for asylum. His solicitors then issued a Judicial Review which was settled by Co
[normal]nsent Order. The Order made it clear that the Home Office had agreed to reconsider his fresh claim as an asylum claim. However, when he applied for support his application was refused on the basis that he was not an asylum seeker as his further submissions
[normal] were still pending. It emerged in his support appeal that the Home Office caseworker had interpreted the Consent Order to mean that they were merely going to reconsider the further submissions, not that they had agreed they amounted to a new asylum claim.
[normal] He won his appeal for support. 
[normal]Case study[bold]: Mr B’s 
[normal]application had been refused on the grounds that it was not belie
[normal]ved he had an outstanding case.  However
[normal], he had recently obtained permission to have his case considered by the Court of Appeal following 
[normal]the Home Office’s refusal of his fresh claim. He had been released from immigration detention but shortly after was admitted to a psychiatric ward as he suffered from serious mental health problems. He was thought to be at risk of suicide and suffered from
[normal] Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. He was sleeping in parks at the time of his support appeal.
[normal] He won his appeal and was given support. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Connection to the UK
[normal] as a determinant of legal aid
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Case study: [bold]Ms B arrived in the UK 14 years ago and claimed asylum. In 2009 she submitted a fresh claim to the Home Office which was still outstanding when we met her. Given the delay in considering her fresh claim, she had been granted permission to work and had take
[normal]n up a job as a care worker, paying taxes in the UK. In June 2012 following a change in policy the Home Office restricted the work she could do to the shortage occupation list. She lost her job. As she was not qualified to carry out any of the jobs on the 
[normal]occupation list she has not been able to work since then and is now in receipt of asylum support.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Case study:[bold] Mr M has been in the UK for 12 years. He now has two young children who are settled in the UK, one of whom is British. Although he does not live with his children he has regular contact with them and takes an active role in their upbringing. When we met h
[normal]im he was in the process of preparing a further application to the Home Office on the basis of this established family life.

[normal]Cases we referred for 
[normal]litigation in 2012
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Case study: [bold]The particular difficulties these individuals will experience when trying to leave the UK is highlighted by the case 
[normal]of Mr A, who is a 
[normal]Bidoon
[normal] from Kuwait.   In common with many Kuwaiti 
[normal]Bidoons
[normal], Mr A and his family had lived Kuwait for many years but never acquired Kuwaiti citizenship.   Whilst in UK he had approached the Kuwaiti embassy several times to try and obtain do
[normal]cuments to return but these were refused on the basis that he was not a national of Kuwait.  Following a decision by the Tribunal to refuse him support on the basis that he was not taking enough steps to return, we referred his case to a solicitor.   Durin
[normal]g the process of the judicial review, the Treasury Solicitor settled and agreed to grant him support and to backdate this to the day of his appeal hearing.  
[normal]Case Study: [bold]This is illustrated by the case of Mr B who, following a successful appeal, was offere
[normal]d accommodation in Wales.   However, his partner and two young children were housed in London which would have severely limited the contact he could have with them.   The solicitors issued a letter before claim, pointing out Home Office’s duties to promote
[normal] the welfare of children and also their obligations to preserve family life as far as possible.  Following the letter, UKBA agreed to house Mr B close to his family in London thus ensuring he had sufficient contact with his partner and children.

[normal]Failed asylum-seeker had been receiving s4 support on basis of no safe route of return to his home town of Kirkuk, Iraq.  SSHD then decid
[normal]ed there was a safe route, so he no longer qualified under (c) and instead needed to show he was taking all reasonable steps (a).  Issue was whether the Tribunal could consider for itself issue of whether safe route of return, or, alternatively, allow appe
[normal]al if SSHD’s opinion (that is safe) is unlawful on 
[normal]Wednesbury
[normal] grounds.  ASA and SSHD both took view that the ASA did not have the jurisdiction to look behind the SSHD’s opinion, and were found to be right. 
[normal]Para 26 as to the ‘availability of judicial review
[normal] in which the correctness in public law terms of the holding by the S of S of a particular opinion may be tested’ precludes the ASA having to do this. 
[normal]But clarified that ASA can substitute its view regarding (a).  Secondary issue as to whether a route of r

[normal]R (
[normal]Nigatu
[normal]) v SSHD
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal][2004] EWHC 1806
[normal]Issue of what counts as fresh claim so as to trigger entitlement to 
[normal]support (so crucial to the proposals as the same ‘threshold’ is being used to decide entitlement to legal aid, 3.58). By time of full hearing of JR took place, the SSHD had accepted it as a fresh claim but Mr Justice Collins decided issue of importance so 
[normal]should proc
[normal]eed.  N 
[normal]had attempted to apply for support, but NASS refused it although they acknowledged that the HO had received his fresh claim (applications for s4 support prior to 2005 did not lead to an appeal and so JR was the only remedy here).  Judgme
[normal]nt quotes Bingham in CA in 
[normal]Onibiyo
[normal] 1996 on why the Refugee Convention must allow for fresh claims, and what test should be to qualify as one (new material etc) and that if it is a fresh claim, then there must be a right of appeal. And that JR is the correc
[normal]t remedy to use to compel the SSHD, if he errs, to accept it as a fresh claim. But therefore making a fresh claim and it being accepted as one are 2 separate stages, and only the latter triggers entitlement to s95 support
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Unclear
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Case contains essential 
[normal]guidance to both sides on when a ‘fresh claim’ is made, and therefore when asylum support (s95 or s4) becomes available.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Although there will now be legal aid to make a fresh claim, it is unclear as to whether there will be legal aid for the same asylum se
[normal]eker for an asylum support law case

[normal]On issue of when an asylum-seeker fails to appeal an asylum refusal in time, and instead submits an out of time appeal, and whether remains entitled to s95 support. The CA

[normal]Yes
[normal]&#xa0;
