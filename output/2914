&#xa0;
[normal]Written evidence from Margaret and Janet Brooks ([bold]A[bold]CQ 15)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]We are making this submission because we have expressed serious concerns about patient safety at an NHS Trust to the CQC, but we do not believe the CQC has investigated them.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Brief summary of circumstances[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]In 2009, our mother was offered elective keyhole surgery in an NHS Trust hospital.
[normal] 
[normal]She was told by the consultants at the pre-assessment that she would need high dependency post-operative care and that if this was not available, the operation would not go ahead.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, following surgery, my mother did not go to an HDU or a Level 1 surgical ward for close monitoring, but was consigned to a Level 0 contingency ward.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This was an inappropriate environment for her.
[normal] 
[normal]She subsequently came to serious harm due to failures of nursing and medical care and this resulted in her death.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The investigations[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]A 
[normal]year
[normal]-
[normal]long
[normal] investigation into our mother's case by BHRUT (the Trust) in 2010 brought no information to light.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In 
[normal]November
[normal] 
[normal]2010, we made a referral to the NMC Fitness to Practise of the nurses involved, giving the times of shift, date of shift and signatures of the nurses. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, in September 2011, the NMC informed us that, despite this information, the Trust had said that they were not able to identify these nurses.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Therefore, the NMC said it would close the case due to 'evidential difficulties' but would be flagging the issues raised by writing to the CQC.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The NMC flagged concerns about contingency wards to the CQC[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]In September 2011, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) wrote to the Care Quality Commission: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]'Our
[normal] investigations have suggested that the root of the highly distressing events experienced was poor staffing levels and organisation within the hospital. The NMC has therefore raised this with the hospital and is also writing to the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in order to flag this issue. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The crux of the nursing issues lies with poor staffing levels and crucially the absence of leadership such that the most senior nurse was a Band 5 (the most junior grade).
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The NMC believes this to be the key factor in the poor care experienced by [the patient].
[normal] 
[normal]We are particularly concerned as there was felt to be no need to investigate or plan to prevent the examples of poor care in the future.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We also believe that there is a wider issue here that may become more important in the coming months and years.
[normal] 
[normal]This is the issue of temporary or contingency wards being set up with no training, no permanent staffing or leadership and minimal resources.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In light of the above, we invite the CQC to look into this Trust further.'
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We understood that the CQC would not be able to deal with our case individually.
[normal]Besides which,
[normal] 
[normal]by now, a Parliamentary Health Ombudsman investigation into our mother's case was underway.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, we presumed that this formal letter from the NMC regarding its concerns about the contingency wards at the Trust would lead the CQC to look into the conditions on these hastily-opened, poorly staffed contingency wards. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The CQC investigation [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]In July 2011
[normal], w
[normal]e became aware that the CQC was beginning an investigation into this hospital Trust.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Investigation poster that was circulated by CQC at the time asked for people's experiences of care at BHRUT in specific areas 
[normal]–
[normal] maternity, A&amp;E and 
[normal]'
[normal]the[bold] surgery department'[bold].
[normal]              
[normal]The adverts in the local paper also specified maternity, A&amp;E and 
[normal]the surgery department[bold].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We responded to this request by submitting a written account to the CQC investigation of the events surrounding the care, treatment and death of our mother in January 2010, following elective surgery while she was in the care of BHRUT.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The CQC report into BHRUT 2011[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The CQC Investigation report into the Trust, was published in October 2011. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It highlighted the pressure surges in the emergency departments and the lack of ‘flow’ throughout the Trust’s two hospitals. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, it did not look at the ways in which the Trust copes with these pressure surges and lack of flow.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Trust's Winter Resilience plans show that when there are ambulances queuing round the block for A&amp;E and too few beds available in the hospital, a level of alert is dictated which triggers the Trust to make more beds available by hastily re-opening wards that have been closed.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]These wards are known as contingency or dependency wards. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We were concerned to see that the CQC report had nothing to say on the subject of the Trust's contingency wards, despite the fact that the NMC had specifically asked them to look into this matter.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Nor did the CQC report recommend any action to safeguard patients placed in these
[normal] 
[normal]temporary contingency wards.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Surgery[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]We were also concerned to see from the CQC report, that the CQC had not investigated the surgery department as its pre-investigation publicity had indicated it would.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It had, instead, investigated elective 'vascular surgery'. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We found this decision incomprehensible. 
[normal]The Trust's minutes showed that of the 121 complaints the Trust had received in March 2011, 42 complaints were about the Surgical department. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In their investigation report, the CQC confirmed that they did not receive any major concerns from patients or relatives regarding vascular surgery though they did receive 
[normal]'a
[normal] number of complaints about care in other surgical specialities'. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We wrote to the CQC on 21 February 2012, asking: 'Given that no major concerns had been expressed by patients or relatives about vascular surgery, why did the CQC choose to investigate it?'
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The CQC's reply [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Matthew Trainer, Deputy Operations Director of the London Region replied on 13 March 2012: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]"The investigation was of the trust using three pathways to seek information. We had concerns in both A&amp;E and maternity but it is important to balance that with an area not necessarily known to have concerns to explore whether the concerns in A&amp;E and maternity were only in those areas or more widespread." 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We did not think this was a satisfactory answer. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The CQC was conducting an investigation into risks to patient safety, not an academic experiment that needed a 'control'. 
[normal]The way 'to explore whether the concerns in A&amp;E and maternity were only in those areas or more widespread' would be to look at the other department which had received a high volume of complaints i.e. surgery. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The high volume of complaints about the surgery department raised concerns about patient safety. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It seemed to us that for the CQC to choose to overlook these concerns was a dereliction of its regulatory duty. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]One month after publication of the CQC report [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Once the investigation was over, complaints about surgery at BHRUT continued at the same high volume. Trust minutes show that 40 new complaints about surgery were received in November 2011. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]One month after the publication of the CQC report, in November 2011, unsupervised trainee doctors at the Trust operated on a pregnant woman with catastrophic results that led to her totally avoidable death. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We cannot help but think that, had the CQC investigated the complaints raised about the surgery department at the time, the result might have been an intervention that could have prevented the outcome of this extreme and tragic case.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A press-release by the Trust following her inquest last month in 2013, states that the mistakes made in surgery were 'indefensible'. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Trust gives assurances that, since this patient's death, they have drawn up an 'extensive action plan' to improve patient safety in surgery and have implemented a list of 30 recommendations. 
[normal]The surgical patient safety recommendations in the action plan are so fundamental that they only raise the question as to why these basic safeguards were not already in place. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]And if they were not in place before the CQC investigation, why had the CQC not followed up the large volume of complaints from the public about surgery as it had originally indicated it would do?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The opening of contingency wards[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The CQC's investigation update report was published in June 2012, 8 months after the initial investigation report.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It did not suggest that any progress had been made to lessen the pressure on the emergency departments.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Emergency care at the Trust was described as: "...consistently failing to meet essential standards"
[normal] 
[normal]and "the emergency department at Queen's in particular is struggling to deliver acceptable care". 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The minutes of the Trust show that when ambulances are queuing round the block at the larger of the Trust's two hospitals, they are diverted to the emergency department of the smaller one.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The Trust’s Winter Resilience Plans for 2009 through to 2013 show that, when the Trust’s emergency and critical care departments cannot cope, the Trust makes more beds available by re-opening wards that have been closed, as contingency wards. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There seems to be a reluctance to address the patient safety issues which are thrown up by the sudden re-opening of closed wards at times of high alert, since this is embedded in the system. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is seen as a vital short term solution to the winter capacity issues, regardless of whether these wards put patients’ safety at risk. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The CQC’s recent updates confirm that the sustained pressure on the emergency and critical departments of the Trust’s two hospitals has worsened. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]So long as this continues to be the case, ill-equipped and inadequately staffed contingency wards will continue to be hastily opened, putting the patients who are consigned to them at risk of ‘poor care’. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Patients who opt for elective surgery at the Trust do not realise that ambulance diverts and ‘black breaches’ in the A&amp;Es of either hospital, affects them, and could potentially compromise their safety. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Even if they have been assured of high level post-operative care by the Surgical team, as our mother was, these patients could find themselves, as our mother did, waking from surgery in a hastily opened Level 0 ward, with too few nurses to ensure her safety, with no electric beds, and with staff of inappropriate skill-mix. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In our mother's case it was a disastrous decision that caused her to come to grievous harm and led to her death.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Health Service Ombudsman[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Parliamentary Health Service Ombudsman fully upheld our complaint about the care provided to our mother by Barking Havering and Redbridge NHS University Trust.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]She stated that aspects of
[normal] postoperative nursing and medical care, and treatment were inadequate and fell so far below the applicable standard that they amounted to service failure.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Ombudsman said our mother should not have gone to this temporary contingency ward.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However the Ombudsman did not investigate how this came about.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our mother was a high risk elective patient who had been told by the consultants that she needed close post-operative monitoring in a high dependency bed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How was it that she came to be consigned post-operatively to a 0-level ward that only been open for 5 days, and which had been set up 
[normal]–
[normal] in the words of the NMC 
[normal]–
[normal] with 'no training, no permanent staffing or leadership and minimal resources'?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Since the Ombudsman did not investigate this, no recommendations were put in place to stop the same thing happening again. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]System failure and the regulators[bold]&#xa0;[bold]We are told that the NMC is unable to look at system failure.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The PHSO identified service failure but did not look into how this failure happened and therefore did not put appropriate recommendations in place to address this.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The CQC is the only regulator with the powers to look at what is happening and intervene.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Yet, we have found the CQC unwilling to engage with the situation. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When we wrote to Matthew Trainer of the CQC in 13 March 2013 asking if there were any plans to look at the issue of the Trust’s contingency wards, his only comment was that:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]"The issue of contingency beds is being addressed with the Trust following clinical advice available internally to CQC."
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The issue of 'contingency beds' is not the same as the issue of 'contingency wards' and therefore, we do not think this represented an adequate answer to this question.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]According to the Trust's figures,
[normal] 
[normal]there are over 750,000 people obliged to use these hospitals
[normal] 
[normal](although the CQC continues to underestimate this figure by 50,000 without explanation).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Nothing has been done about the systemic failure and it seems that the CQC does 
[normal]not intend t
[normal]o do anything about the systemic failure, therefore we believe that nothing can stop further avoidable deaths occurring at this Trust.
