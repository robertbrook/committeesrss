"LGO 81\nLocal \ngovernment procurement spend of £45bn a year represents a huge opportunity for investment in the UK and local economies, whilst delivering improved value for money for taxpayers. Local government has not, overall, delivered these objectives because of \nthe\n fragmented management of its procurement spend, lack of coherent strategy and limited expertise available to most councils. \nA policy of local procurement, without a much more sophisticated approach, is a zero sum game. Some councils will benefit\n.\n Other\ns\n will lose. A coherent and more sophisticated approach is needed to boost overall expenditure with UK and local suppliers. \nThe way the spend data are collected flatters the local spend figures. Also, research by the North West Centre of Excellence, when I was director, suggested that local councils mostly used suppliers with whom business had been done for many years, \nrather than\n those likely to generate economic growth. Ways to increase local procurement include:\nSophisticated approaches must be used to take cost and risk out of supply chains and products. Typical improvements may be 15%. Thus, councils will have more money to spend on front line services\n,\n which should create more local employment. \nAchieving the above requires expertise in all markets that few, if any, councils can afford if they act independently. Appropriate aggregation of procurement spend will help local government to use its economic power to achieve its objectives. \nCollaboration accounts for just 15% of spend despite great commonality in products, services, suppliers and the knowledge and techniques needed. There is scope to increase this greatly.\nProcurement exists to support councils \nto \ndeliver the services that residents need. A\n local government owned \nintegrated procurement network, consisting of national and regional centres of expertise (please refer to the Appendix) would provide councils with the capability needed without impinging on local democracy. It is suggested that the LGA and SOLACE work up a proposal to create such a model\n, obtain support from sufficient councils \nand seek funding from DCLG to build-up the capability of the best procurement teams in local government into such centres and invest in improving commissioning. The precedent is that extra funding has been found to support radical procurement initiatives for the NHS and central government.\n17 November 2013\n&#xa0;APPENDIX  INTEGRATED PROCUREMENT NETWORK: CENTRES OF EXPERTISE&#xa0;Specialist National Centres:&#xa0;\nRegional/Geographical Centres:&#xa0;\nLocal Procurement&#xa0;\nOther Features&#xa0;\nCommissioning&#xa0;\n17 November 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
