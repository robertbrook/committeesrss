"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Birnberg Peirce &amp; Partners [CT 18]&#xa0;\nEvidence on Counter Terrorism - re: oral evidence 12th November 2013 relating to Mohamed Ahmed Mohamed ('CC')&#xa0;\nWe regret that we did not have immediate sight of the transcript of the above evidence\n \ngiven to the Committee. We hope nevertheless as the issues are of continuing\n \nimportance in public debate it may still be of assistance for us to provide clarification of\n \na number of points on which the factual evidence presented to the Committee has, we\n \nbelieve, been incorrect or is deserving of further supporting material for a full\n e\nxplanation.\n&#xa0;\nWe represented Mr Moha\nmed as his solicitors following his arrival in the UK on 14 March 2011, after he had been removed against his will from Somaliland to the UK (as opposed to Somalia where he lived with his wife and child) and was upon arrival placed under a Control Order and required to live in Ipswich.\n&#xa0;\nA number of legal challenges came to be made on Mr Mohamed's behalf. All of these have far wider significance than for his case alone. \n&#xa0;\nThe central issues on which the courts had to decide were\n:\n&#xa0;\n1\n. \nThe legality of the Control Order imposed on 'CC' at the airport when he arrived in the UK on 14 March 2011.\n2. The subsequent legality of the TPIM (Control Orders having given way to\n \nTPIMs in January 2012). (The challenges to these two orders were\n \nconjoined in proceedings in the High Court.)\n3. The lawfulness of the Schedule 7 examination of CC at Heathrow Airport.\n4. The evidence that supported an allegation of \"tampering\" with the G4S/GPS\n \ntag worn by him between 19th April and 16th May 2013.\n5. The sequence of the allegations of breaches of the Control Order and the\n \nTPIM and their treatment by the courts.\n&#xa0;\nWe start with the period of time in which Mr Mohamed was imprisoned for breaches of\n \nobligations placed upon him by first the Control Order and then the TPIM.\n&#xa0;\nThe sequence of the allegations of breaches of the Control Order and the TPIM and their treatment by the courts.\n&#xa0;\nMr Moha\nmed was arrested, as the evidence given to your Committee by Charles Farr\n \ncorrectly stated, for breaches of the Control Order between August and October 2011.\n \n(Thereafter he was charged with breaches of the TPIM.) The evidence on this issue\n \ngiven to the Committee, came in answer to questions from Michael Ellis MP\n:\n&#xa0;\nQ. \"Despite 14 allegations of a breach of a Control Order and 6 allegations of\n \na breach of TPIMs, he keeps on being re-admitted to bail from custody by\n \nthe courts ... ?\" [Further evidence related to a third accusation, concerning\n \nalleged tamper with his tag in relation to which he was released in August\n \n2013. We comment on this separately.]\n&#xa0;\nQ. \"If cases of these breaches had not been stayed (pending the High\n \nCourt's consideration of the legality of the Control Order and TPIM),\n \nwould he have been in prison?\" \"Almost certainly serving a sentence of\n \nmore than a year in prison?\"\n&#xa0;\nA. (Charles Farr) ''That is correct.\n&#xa0;\nQ. \"He played the legal system?\"\n&#xa0;\nA. \"I can't comment on that\".\n&#xa0;\nQ. \"No I can\".\n&#xa0;\nThe comments we would make are these;\n&#xa0;\na) Mr Moha\nmed, remanded in custody for the 14 and 6 breaches, had at\n \nthe time of his respective releases on bail, already served over 8 months\n \non remand in prison. It had already been acknowledged by the\n \nprosecution by the time of his release on 6th August 2013 for the third\n \n\"tamper\" allegation, that even if he had been convicted of the previous\n \nbreaches at a subsequent trial, he would have already served more than\n \nhis sentence for those breaches by reason of the time he \nhad already spent in prison\n.\n&#xa0;\nb) The context of the 14 and 6 breaches was this; Mr Mohamed had been\n \nseized in what later emerged as a joint \"operation\" with UK agencies by\n \nforces in Somaliland. The description he subsequently gave was of\n \nsevere ill treatment for two months by Somaliland officers including\n \ntreatment categorised as constituting torture for two months \n–\n the\n \nquestions put to him while detained focussed on information relevant to\n \nthe UK. At the conclusion of his detention in Somaliland, instead of being\n \nreturned as he had asked to Somalia where he had resided for many\n \nyears with his wife and child, he was forcibly removed to the UK.\n \nImmediately on arrival he was placed under a Control Order and required\n \nto live in Ipswich where he knew nobody. He was not only traumatised\n \nfrom his experience beginning on 14th January 2011 (of which medical\n \nevidence was available to the courts) but was entirely isolated in Ipswich.\n \nFor that reason and others, a number of the severe regulations upon him,\n \nimposed by the Control Order were breached by him. At the time of his\n \narrest, for a second set of breaches, he commented that he preferred to\n \nbe in prison, as at least he would be with other people.\n&#xa0;\nc) We feel it necessary to bring to your attention two earlier and not\n \ndissimilar cases of breach of Control Orders, both cases involving\n \nabsconsion (of \nCeri\n \nB\nullivant and 'AN') which ended in both cases with\n \ntheir acquittal - in the case of \nCeri\n \nB\nullivant by a jury who accepted that\n \nhe had reasonable excuse because of his despair at the crushing of any\n \nnormality of existence for him (the Control Order was subsequently\n \nrevoked by the High Court in any event). Mr \nB\nullivant had absconded\n \nfrom the address at which he was required to live, but subsequently\n \nreturned and handed himself in to the police, was arrested, charged and\n \ntried. In the second case 'AN', a Londoner, who was a victim of torture\n \nwhen a student in Syria, was placed on his return to the UK under a\n \nControl Order in Leicester (into a similarly isolated existence). He also\n \nabsconded, was arrested, and spent a lengthy time on remand in\n \nBelmarsh prison. The criminal prosecution against him for breach was\n \nultimately dropped and he was formally acquitted when the Control Order\n \nwas quashed (following a decision in the House of Lords and subsequent\n \ndecision by the High Court that the Control Order was void \nab\n initio\n).\n&#xa0;\nThe evidence that supported an allegation of \"tampering\" with the G4S/GPS tag\n \nworn by him between 19\nth\n April 2013 until 16\nth\n May 2013\n.\n&#xa0;\nd) The third allegation against Mr Mohamed, made on 25th July 2013, was\n \nas Mr Farr correctly stated in evidence based on claims by G4S that he\n \nhad \"tampered\" with a GPS tag (on the 16th May 2013). The\n \ncircumstances of his being granted bail on that allegation (almost\n \nimmediately) deserve separate attention.\n&#xa0;\ne) By the date that he was charged with the alleged tag tamper (as we set\n \nout above) he had served any potential sentence for the outstanding\n \nbreach allegations. Moreover when Mr Mohamed was charged with this\n \noffence, there were separately before the Central Criminal Court identical\n \nallegations made by G4S in relation to two other unconnected TPIM\n \nwearers of GPS tags, 'TP' and 'CE'. All were granted bail by very\n \nexperienced Old Bailey judges on the basis that the growing statistical\n \nimprobability of tampering by a significant number of TPIM subjects all\n \nwearers of the GPS tag was exceptional.\n&#xa0;\nf) On 22nd October 2013 the prosecution communicated formally with this\n \nfirm that it would no longer pursue this tampering case against Mr\n \nMohamed. Simultaneously the prosecution communicated the same\n \ndecision in relation to the other two cases ('CE' and 'TP'). Police at the\n \nsame time indicated to a fourth individual under a TPIM, bailed to return\n \nto the police station on the same allegation, that no further action was to\n \nbe taken in relation to him. A similar approach, to our knowledge, is\n \ncurrently being taken in relation to other cases where the tags are\n \ncracking or malfunctioning in very similar ways. This extraordinary\n \nsituation has we believe been brought about by the following accidental\n \nsequence of events.\n&#xa0;\n(\ni\n) By accident of historical representation, this firm was already\n \nrepresenting a number of individuals on TPIMs who were\n \nwearing the new (introduced in or around April 2012) GPS\n \nsatellite tag. A growing number of arrests took place of\n \nseparate individuals, not known to each other all of whom\n \nexpressed astonishment at the allegation by the monitoring\n \ncompany G4S, that they had deliberately interfered with their\n \ntags. (Solicitors representing a further individual reported that a\n \nsimilar allegation had been made in his case.)Two reports of\n \n\"tampering\" for two separate individuals came when they had\n \non separate occasions, in separate cities, been praying in a\n \nmosque.\n&#xa0;\n(ii) Over a period of a year, this firm had already expressed clearly\n \nin writing to the police and the Crown Prosecution Service our\n \nbelief that there was a malfunction of the tags, and that\n \nindividuals were being arrested and prosecuted when the\n \nfailure emanated instead from G4S's faulty equipment and/or\n \ninadequate research. In this regard we attach a note for your\n \nconsideration summarising the position of the evidence within\n \nCC's prosecution and others for the same offence.\n&#xa0;\n(iii) The Committee's attention is drawn to the opinion of Ross\n \nAnderson of Cambridge University (Professor of Security\n \nEngineering at Cambridge University) who raised a very real\n \nconcern that the damage to the tag could be caused by\n \nrecurrent stress fractures (of the kind that for example caused\n \nComet aircraft to be grounded in the past). It appeared to the\n \nindependent experts consulted by the defence that G4S had\n \nplaced the large GPS tag introduced in April 2012 on the same\n \nstrap tested for use only on the much smaller previous tag, with\n \nadditional strain inevitable. It should be noted that no testing,\n \ndespite repeated requests that this issue be considered, to our\n \nknowledge, was done of a further likely cause of strain\n \ninevitably caused by praying five times a day. Requests by\n \ndefence experts to conduct tests and to \nhave access to test\n \nresults to establish (or refute) these clearly stated propositions\n \nhad not been met when the cases were all suddenly\n \ndiscontinued by the CPS.\n&#xa0;\ng) On 1st November 2013 this prosecution against Mr Mohamed was\n \nformally discontinued (the prosecution against TP and CE had been\n \ndiscontinued at an earlier hearing on 30\nth\n October 2013). We requested\n \nfrom the Prosecution both in writing and orally at the Court the forensic\n \nreasons behind the prosecution's decision to discontinue the cases. The\n \nCourt had expressed itself as sympathetic to the defence request, but as\n \nyet the prosecution have provided only a general answer that there was\n \n\"insufficient evidence to proceed\". The same explanation was given by\n \nthe Home Secretary in her reply to your raising of the same question in\n \nthe debate on 4th November 2013;\n&#xa0;\n\"\nI urge her to look at the role of the G4S and the tags that have been\n \nprovided\n\".\n&#xa0;\nThe adequacy of the Secretary of State's answer is one with which we are\n \nbound to take issue;\n&#xa0;\n\"\nthe police believe that in this case the tag functioned exactly as it should\n \nhave done ..... he referred to the court case. The issue was not about the\n \neffectiveness of the tags, but about weakening the evidence threshold for\n \ntaking a criminal prosecution in relation to the operation of the tags\n\".\n&#xa0;\nh) No answer given to date has provided any satisfactory explanation as to\n \nhow three entirely separate individuals came to be arrested and\n \nprosecuted on the basis of claimed \"scientific evidence\" and how it was\n \nthat all three prosecutions came to be discontinued following a direct\n \nchallenge in advance of any trial by the defence to the reliability of the\n \nG4S tags.\n \n&#xa0;\ni\n) Our concern regarding the issue of tags remains, following the evidence\n \nof David Anderson QC at your Committee's hearing on 12th November\n \n2013. The impression may have been left that no one now accused of\n \ntampering with their tag can be prosecuted. This is very far from the case.\n \nThere have been many prosecutions in the past and no doubt ongoing for\n \ntampering allegations relating to the smaller tag. No doubt also there can\n \nand will be in the future prosecutions for damage or interference with the\n \nlarger GPS tags. What is the issue here in these particular cases is very\n \nspecific, that without evidence that the individuals had actually tried to\n \nremove their tags evidence of strain on the tag strap was repeatedly\n \ninterpreted as deliberate \"tampering\". The claimed scientific opinion on\n \nwhich each prosecution relied can be summarised thus: that there was no\n \ninnocent explanation for the strain.\n&#xa0;\nj) We note that the Committee received private evidence from G4S about\n \nthe tags. We do not know the reasons for this. Clearly we have a\n \nconcern that at present no one, including the Committee knows why Mr\n \nMohamed's case, and others, were discontinued. This is not intended to\n \nconstitute an abstract quest for information. Not only did the individuals in\n \nquestion spend time in prison before bail (unusually) was granted by\n \njudges at the Old Bailey in each case, on the basis of these allegations,\n \nbut the G4S GPS tags are still being used. The question relates of course\n \nfurthermore to matters concerning the public purse. (In the accompanying\n \nnote we refer to the report by NAPO of June 2012, identifying concern as\n \nto \"technical failures\" of electronic tags generally, not limited to the larger\n \nGPS model.)\n&#xa0;\nk) We would welcome making available any further material that might\n \nassist to the Committee should it wish to conduct further examination of\n \nthis issue.\n&#xa0;\nThe lawfulness of the Schedule 7 stop\n.\n&#xa0;\nOn his arrival at Heathrow airport on 14 March 2011 Mr Mohamed was detained and\n \nquestioned for 6 hours under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act. Approximately 118\n \nquestions were prepared and submitted by the Security Service to the Counterterrorism\n \nUnit of the Metropolitan Police Service for this examination. Furthermore before the\n \nSchedule 7 interview the interviewing officers were instructed by email in the following\n \nterms:\n&#xa0;\n\"\nWe would be grateful if you would NOT be drawn into any discussion with MOHAMED\n \nregarding HMG [Her Majesty's Government] involvement in his arrest. You should be\n \naware that any such write up is likely to be disclosable in any future civil proceedings.\n\"\n&#xa0;\nThe above evidence was given in the court proceedings that followed the imposition of\n \na control order on Mr Mohamed at Heathrow airport. In separate judicial review\n \nproceedings brought on behalf of Mr Mohamed to examine the legality of the stop,\n \nCollins J found his detention and questioning under Schedule 7 to be unlawful. The\n \nquestioning was not being conducted for the purpose of the Act, namely to establish\n \nwhether or not he was involved in acts of terrorism, as the SSHD already was claiming\n \nhe was, and had made a Control Order on that basis even before he had been\n \ndetained in Somaliland (explained below)). Instead it was argued, the stop was being\n \nconducted for an unlawful purpose, of getting information from Mr Mohamed that was\n \nnot tainted by torture in Somaliland. We provide the decision of Mr Justice Collins\n \ndated 20 December 2011. This judgment is of importance, beyond Mr Mohamed's\n \ncase, defining the breadth of Schedule 7 powers. The fact of the Schedule 7 stop links\n \nwith the further issue canvassed below as to the British authorities' knowledge of Mr\n \nMohamed's detention in Somaliland and his treatment there, and in turn to the wider\n \nissue of the UK's alleged complicity in unlawful acts outside the UK.\n&#xa0;\nThe Legality of the Control Order\n/\nTPIM\n&#xa0;\nThe legality of the Control Order\n/\nTPIM itself was in question throughout after Mr\n \nMohamed was notified of its existence at Heathrow Airport on 14th March 2011. That\n \nissue is at present listed to be considered by the Court of Appeal on 23rd January 2014.\n \nThe appeal, due to be heard together with a second linked case CF, will consider very\n \nserious allegations regarding the potential complicity of the UK Government (and its\n \nagents) in unlawful acts including the arrest, detention, torture in Somaliland and\n \nsubsequent unlawful deportation of both CC and CF. It has been argued, that but for\n \nthe unlawful actions of the UK, Mr Mohamed would not have been within the jurisdiction\n \nto be the subject of a Control Order.\n&#xa0;\nWe are aware that you already identified the fundamental question; i.e. why was Mr\n \nMohamed in the UK at all? He at no time, we confirm, wished to be. We observe that\n \nthe Committee was not provided with a considerable amount of evidence available to\n \nthe Home Office, on the record within previous court hearings, that could have provided\n \nthe answer to your question.\n&#xa0;\nThe sequence of the events leading up to Mr Mohamed's arrival in the UK on 14 March\n \n2011 was as follows:\n&#xa0;\nUp until his arrival Mr Mohamed had lived in Somalia since 2007, with his wife with\n \nwhom he had a child. His wife was pregnant with their second child. Mr Mohamed had\n \nno intention of returning to the UK. Nevertheless on 13th January 2011, whilst he was\n \noutside of the jurisdiction in Somaliland, the Secretary of State for the Home\n D\nepartment sought and was granted permission from the High Court to make a non\n-\nderogating\n \nControl Order, i.e. a UK executive measure that can be applied \nonly to\n \npersons who are within the UK\n. On 14th January 2011, \nthe day after\n the Control Order\n \nwas made, Mr Mohamed was arrested and detained in Somaliland in what was\n \ndescribed by the local media as a \n“\nJoint security op\neration of Somalil\nand and British\n \nintelligence\n\". \nMr Mohamed subsequently reported that during the two months of his\n \ndetention in Somaliland that followed he had been tortured and subjected to inhumane\n \ntreatment without any recourse to legal due process. On 13th March 2011, he was\n \nremoved from Somaliland, despite requesting that he be returned to Somalia to his wife\n \nand child, on a one-way travel document provided by British officials in the British\n \nEmbassy in Addis Ababa. On his arrival at Heathrow airport, he was detained and\n \nquestioned unlawfully, as the High Court held, under Schedule 7 TA 2000. The\n \nquestions mirrored those asked when he was interrogated in Somaliland, including\n \nunder torture.\n&#xa0;\nSerious questions concerning the UK's complicity in Mr Mohamed's treatment in\n \nSomaliland were directly raised within Mr Mohamed's Control Order\n/\nTPIM challenge.\n \nWhilst part of the proceedings were conducted in secret session, nevertheless\n \nevidence was disclosed in open session that supported Mr Mohamed's contentions\n \n(and those of \"CF\"). That open evidence we suggest must cast considerable doubt on\n \nthe evidence given to the Committee on 1\n2th\n November 2013 in which the Home Office\n \nwitness Mr Farr stated (in response to your question as to why Mr Mohamed was in the\n \nUK) that the British Government had, \"\nan obligation .... to arrange his removal back to\n \nthe UK\n'.\n&#xa0;\nThe full background necessarily underscores very serious questions; the degree of\n \nknowledge and involvement of the British authorities in Mr Mohamed's arrest, treatment\n \nand forcible return back to this country, with the intention of placing him on a Control\n \nOrder (at cost not only to him but to the public purse), that Control Order having been\n \nmade some two months before his arrival on UK soil. The impression the Committee\n \nmay have at present is that Somaliland had instigated the request for his return to the\n \nUK after lawful detention there, and on their own volition, without the involvement of the\n \nUK hitherto.\n&#xa0;\nWe hope that this letter may serve to demonstrate the complex and serious issues that\n \nwere raised during the passage of the cases concerning Mr Mohamed.\n&#xa0;\nEncl:\n1) Explanatory note re G4S GPS tag cases\n2) Judgment of Collins J, CC v CPM and SSHD [2011] EWHC 3316 (Admin)\n3) Guardian article (\nlan\n Cobain, \nThe real question about the terror suspect who fled\n \nin a burqa: did M/5 bring him here illegally?\n 14/11/2013).\n We include this as the\n \nonly press report to date which has conducted an investigation of the underlying\n \nevidence.\n&#xa0;Birnberg Peirce &amp; Partners29 November 2013Annex&#xa0;\nNOTE ON G4S GPS TAGS &#xa0;\nRe: Cases of breach of TPIM discontinued by the CPS. &#xa0;\nOn the 1\nst\n November at the Central Criminal Court case alleging breach of a TPIM was discontinued by the Crown Prosecution Service. It was the third such case that week on which the Crown offered no evidence. All three cases concerned allegations of tampering with GPS tags and the circumstances of their discontinuance can only raise serious questions as to the reliability of the G4S made GPS tag. \n&#xa0;\nThis firm has represented two thirds of those currently on TPIMS in the country (6 out of 9) – and all of those we represent have been accused of the criminal offence of tampering with their GPS tags, an accusation which all strenuously denied from the outset in police interview and in subsequent correspondence from their lawyers to the CPS. A fourth case was also, discontinued in early November, after an earlier arrest, confirming, it would appear, that neither the police nor the CPS feel confident in the expert evidence on which prosecutions had been mounted which had asserted intentional tampering. Although the allegation has been made against all six individuals by G4S, some instances were not prosecuted. Since the three prosecutions were discontinued in early November, a number of other apparently identical incidents have arisen and are still arising. \n&#xa0;\nHistory of the GPS Tag &#xa0;\nG4S promote their tags on their website thus: \n&#xa0;\n“The technology associated with tagging has been proven to be robust and reliable. It has been thoroughly tested and the equipment is constantly updated to take advantage of the latest technology as well as ensuring it remains tamperproof… \n&#xa0;\nAn active programme of new product development ensures that both our support technology and monitoring equipment is state-of-the-art”. \n&#xa0;\nThe GPS tag was introduced for those on TPIMS, along with other cases, in April 2012. The GPS model is considerably bulkier than its predecessor – as these images show.\n \n&#xa0;\nWe know from its website that G4S placed the much bulkier unit of the GPS tag on the same strap that is used for the previous smaller tag \nhttp://www.g4s.uk.com/en-GB/What%20we%20do/Services/Care%20and%20justice%20services/Monitoring%20Technologies/OM247-SOLO%20GPS%20Tag/\n. \n&#xa0;\nTwo experts instructed by the defence, made the following comments on the three recent cases. \n&#xa0;\nRoss Anderson FRS \nFREng\n, Professor of Security Engineering at Cambridge, said: \n&#xa0;\n\"These are just the latest cases in a whole series. Britain's current curfew tagging systems are not fit for purpose. Systems can provide high levels of false alarms, and operators have difficulty telling false alarms from real ones. \n&#xa0;\nThe quality of evidence is poor, and in at least five cases now, when defence experts have asked to examine the tags a defendant was supposed to have tampered with, or the systems, or even samples of straps and clips, the prosecution has been withdrawn or collapsed. \n&#xa0;\nIn the case of these defendants, the curfew contractor appears to have fitted large, heavy GPS curfew tags using straps and clips that were tested and approved for use with the much lighter curfew tags fitted to people serving short community sentences. It is not at all surprising that the clips eventually fractured. \n&#xa0;\nEvery engineering student learns how fatigue fractures caused two Comet airliners to crash. It is strange that these were not even considered. It is also strange that the Ministry of Justice did not have tags tested for the strain imposed by people praying five times a day. The defendants appear to have been wrongly prosecuted as a result of official incompetence\"\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nDr. David \nSchudel\n, Keith Borer Consultants said, \n&#xa0;\n“One of the striking things about the new GPS units is their size compared to the old PID “tags”. The new GPS devices are bulkier and protrude from the leg lending themselves open to being snagged, twisted or rotated away from the leg, and are generally likely to be subject to greater forces in normal wear than the old style tags. Yet despite the significant change in size, it appears the same attachment clips and straps have been used as before. There seems to be a high rate of failure of these new GPS devices which manifests as a tamper-alert but with the device still fixed to the leg”. \n&#xa0;\nThe CPS discontinued these cases after the defence had requested basic data regarding the integrity of the tags, including confirmation of the testing that had been carried out on the new GPS tag. This led to the prosecution first requesting an adjournment of the Pleas and Case Management hearing and subsequently offering no evidence. Following notification of discontinuance of the cases this firm wrote to the CPS requesting confirmation of the forensic basis for discontinuance of the cases but to date the CPS has informed us only that they considered there was insufficient evidence to proceed. \n&#xa0;\nBackground to the Electronic Tagging Cases (GPS) &#xa0;\nThe Home Office, in relation to the cases of individuals who are the subject of the successor to Control Orders (TPIMs) required that each individual wear an electronic tag (a device that registers to a central monitoring company when the individual leaves and arrives at the address in which he is authorised to live). Until 2012 individuals subject to such a regime (just as many individuals on bail facing criminal charges and subject to conditions), were required to wear a standard electronic tagging device. After 2012, the individuals under TPIMs were required to wear the larger device (GPS) which claims the further capacity to register their whereabouts.\n&#xa0;\nThe company contracted with the Home Office/Ministry of Justice to provide the devices is G4S (and in some areas of the country SERCO). For more than a year and a half, after each allegation of tamper with the larger GPS tag came to be made against first one then another and then ultimately all of the individuals we represent subject to TPIMs, all strenuously denied that they deliberately, or even consciously, interfered or tampered with their tags. \n&#xa0;\nTPIMs are civil orders by the Executive which impose restrictions such as who the individual can meet, where the individual can go and what in practical terms the individual is able to do. However to breach any of those restrictions, including to tamper with the tag, constitutes a criminal offence for which the individual concerned is liable to a sentence of up to five years’ imprisonment. The individual faces a trial before a jury, which will be told that he is in breach of an obligation imposed under the TPIM regime (and that the breach of the obligation is an offence under the Terrorism Act). What the jury will not be told (and what the individual himself \nwill never have been told, in any or any adequate detail) is why he is under that regime – that much is produced in secret evidence only. \n&#xa0;\nThe principle upon which electronic tagging systems are based is of a rubber strap which clips inside the device. If the strap is broken, an optic question mark is exposed, and sets off a “tampering” alarm. \n&#xa0;\nThe company concerned has claimed that extensive testing was carried out to establish the tag’s reliability and, if any, vulnerabilities. Experts relied upon by the prosecution have produced reports which assert its reliability. No tests appear however, ever to have been done on the strap once the far larger electronic monitoring device (the GPS) came to be attached yet the strap is identical to that used for the smaller device. What it appears was never factored in, is the additional degree of strain that the larger device must place upon the strap, nor upon the clumsiness of the device and the far greater propensity to it being knocked and hit (more than one wearer of the new tag has reported tripping/falling down stairs, and knocking, for instance on a bicycle). A further factor for which confirmation of testing was very specifically requested was an assessment of the potential strain caused by praying five times each day. Our own lay observations of a demonstration of this aspect on several of the individuals concerned suggest it is also a factor deserving of further investigation. (Of the nine individuals subject to TPIMs (and the larger tag) eight had previously been subject to Control Orders (and the smaller tag) for a number of years and no allegations of tampering had been made against any during the Control Order regime.) \n&#xa0;\nHistory of problems with the tags &#xa0;\nIssues with the tags used by G4S have been raised previously. If, as it appears, there are particular issues concerning the design of the GPS tag – it would be a matter of considerable concern if these have not been bought to the attention of the Minister of Justice and the Home Secretary. \n&#xa0;\nIn June 2012 NAPO published a briefing “Electronic Tagging – A Flawed System” which cited 120 case studies and identified from them that an area of concern was ‘technical failure’ (\nhttp://www.napo.org.uk/about/news/news.cfm/newsid/200\n). The Home Secretary responded that she would ‘look very seriously at the report’ and was committed to ensuring the system was ‘working properly’ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18432500\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe Minister of Justice asked in the Serious Fraud Office in July 2013 to investigate G4S for overcharging tens of millions of pounds on electronic tagging contracts for offenders http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jul/11/g4s-investigated-overcharging-millions-pounds. In the same month a G4S whistleblower made allegations that the equipment was faulty \nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2362785/G4S-whistleblower-Nigel-Mills-reveals-criminals-roaming-free-security-firm-blunders.html\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe future &#xa0;\nThese cases raise questions as to the tags’ continuing use. If there is now compelling evidence to suggest they are unreliable, it is in the public interest that this be investigated. In particular any criminal prosecution must be mounted on the basis of sound evidence. Prosecutions based upon scientific evidence are governed by clearly established principles; that the evidence should be sound, of the highest integrity, subject to rigorous safeguards and with the underlying data on which claims are made, open to responsible scrutiny by scientific peers. It is clearly entirely unsatisfactory that all that is presently known is that these cases were discontinued, initiated as they had been by claimed expert assessments in each case that there was no innocent explanation for the tamper. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBirnberg Peirce and Partners \nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nNot printed\n \nNot printed\n \nNot printed.\n"
