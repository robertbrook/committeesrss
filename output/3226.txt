[[[Supplementary written evidence received from the British Retail Consortium (BRC)]]]28 October 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Business rates are extremely high compared with other corporate taxes and are less competitive than property taxes in competitor countries;&#xa0;b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The current business rates model does not respond adequately to economic and property market changes.&#xa0;c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The current model is acting as a further disincentive to invest in secondary or non-prime centres that already find it hard to attract investment. &#xa0;d)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The digital transformation occurring within the retail sector has resulted in the business rate system further exacerbating cost divergence between traditional and digital retail platforms. Retailersâ€™ decision making is being increasingly driven by tax advantages as the cost of operating on the high street is now increasingly out of sync with the economic reality and changing consumer preferences. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
