[[[Written Evidence Submitted by Roy Sherliker t/a Elec-craft Electrical Services]]]Summary&#xa0;Personal Evaluation of Part P I write as a self-employed electrician registered with NAPIT. I hold a BEng Degree in Civil Engineering, having retrained over ten years ago to be an electrician. I am a member of the IET, I have C&amp;G qualifications for electrical work, and have over ten years’ experience in the industry, almost entirely in the domestic sector.&#xa0;It would appear that electrical installation work in the UK can be carried out by almost anyone who considers themselves to be capable of doing it without fear of retribution. The dangers of electricity are ignored by many who should not be doing electrical installation work, but because it can be done behind closed doors and “it works” the potential consequences are often dismissed. There is also widespread denial of having been involved in doing something when challenged. Quite often people are more than happy to accept complete ignorance of any law when it comes to electrical work which is quite odd when you consider the potential dangers of faulty work, such as fires, electric shock and electrocution. When bone fide trades people identify faulty or dangerous work and nobody is prepared to accept responsibility for it they also deny knowledge of Part P. If it is not done correctly or doesn’t comply with the Law it can easily be covered up and hidden. At a domestic level lack of training or real understanding about electricity in the home does not prevent the home do-it-yourself enthusiast from having a go, nor does it adequately ensure companies and individuals who engage in the carrying out of electrical installation work are truly competent to be doing so. Competent Persons Schemes were formed as a direct result of the implementation of Part P of the Building Regulations because of a requirement by this Law upon an individual to be a member of such a scheme in order that they could self-certify their work and circumvent the alternative to this of calling upon the Local Government Building Control department to carry out that role. Part P was lacking in its structure to compensate for inadequacies of the LABC to carry out their role and almost total reliance on the CPSs to perform the function. Furthermore there was universal misunderstanding of the notification requirements of Part P where certain categories of electrical work had to be notified as being carried out, presumably because they were deemed higher risk if carried out incorrectly or improperly. However, the general interpretation was that non-notifiable work could be carried out by non-CPS members. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;              17 November 2013&#xa0;
