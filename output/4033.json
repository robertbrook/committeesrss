"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom [FBB0036]&#xa0;Summary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAlthough certain genres, such as impartial news and current affairs are essential to a public service remit, ‘public service’ s\nhould not be seen as confined to specific genres.  The values of ‘intrinsic importance and merit’ apply across the board.  The BBC’s non-commercial status has underpinned its leading role in a wide range of genres, including innovative comedy, popular dram\na and numerous entertaining factual formats. This competition with commercially funded channels has been essential to maintain a high standard across terrestrial broadcasting as a whole.\nThe Corporation’s role in pioneering technological developments in th\ne public interest is central to its public service remit, as is its delivery of exceptional online content.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFunding by licence fee rather than direct taxation underpins the BBC’s editorial independence from the Government -even though it remains vulnerable to Government pressure.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThis proposal also assumes that a limited part of the broadcast output can be described as ‘public service content’ rather than recognising that broadcas\nting as a whole offers a service to the public\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n46. As newspapers, that are not subject to impartiality requirements, become ‘broadcasters’, with online audio-\nvisual content, there are renewed threats to impartiality rules. \n….\n The standards of public service broadcasting, and in particular the all-important requirements for impartiality and balance, could be seriously jeopardised by the effects of politically pa\nrtisan broadcasting creeping in through the back door. In our view, online versions of newspapers should therefore come within the regulatory scope of \nOfcom\n, but with a lighter regime than for conventional broadcasters\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;December 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nBBC Annual Report 2012-\n2013\n (London, BBC, 2013) at: \nhttp://downloads.bbc.co.uk/annualreport/pdf/2012-13/bbc-annualreport-overview-2012-13.pdf\n accessed 27 November 2013\n&#xa0;\n \n \nBBC Annual Report 2012-2013\n \nCampaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom,  \nSubmission to House of Lords Select Committee on Communi\ncations Consultation on Media Plurality\n (April\n 2013)\n (London, CPBF\n)  at: \nhttp://www.cpbf.org.uk/body.php?doctype=policies&amp;ref=0&amp;section=0\n accessed 27\nth\n November 2013\n"
