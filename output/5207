[normal]Data provided by the UK Haemophilia Centre Doctors' Organisation (UKHCDO). These are minimum figures. Central reporting for bleeding disorder patients is incomplete, and seven patients have opted out of the central UKHCDO database. Individual haemophilia centres were asked to send out standardised letters of notification to all their ‘at risk’ patients, but the exact number of patients who received these letters and are therefore aware of their risk is not known.
[normal]b.[bold] Data provided by the Institute for Child Health. A small number of ‘at risk' growth hormone recipients are not included in the Institute of Child Health study so the true number ‘at risk’ will be greater. The exact number of growth hormone recipients in the ICH study currently aware of their risk is not known, as given their age at the original notification many were informed indirectly, by their parents.
[normal]c.[bold] 
[normal]These are minimum figures given the comments made above.
[normal] [bold]d.[bold] An asymptomatic infection is when an individual does not exhibit any of the signs and symptoms of CJD in life but abnormal 
[normal]prion
[normal] protein indicative of CJD infection has been found in tissue obtained from them. In these cases the abnormal 
[normal]prion
[normal] protein was identified during post mortem after the individuals had died of other causes.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Recommendations
[normal]A clear communication policy should be employed to relay updates, precautionary action, etc., to product-users.
[normal]A review of safety measures to account for emerging risks and ensure efficacy of manufacturing and viral inactivation processes.
[normal]Individuals should be given the opportunity to opt in or out of receiving notifications about screening tests or potential infection. Patients who opt in should be regularly updated on the evolution of knowledge and diagnostic tests.
[normal]Clear processes, responsibility and consent should exist in the collection of patient data.
[normal]As soon as is practicable, new technologies should be employed to further improve donor screening, therapeutic products, etc.
