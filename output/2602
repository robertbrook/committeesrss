default              
defaultThe British Horseracing Authority (BHA), the Governing and Regulatory body for the sport of thoroughbred horseracing in Great
default Britain, welcomes the opportunity to respond on behalf of the sport (Racing) to the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee’s inquiry in to the role of women in sport
default.
default1.2
default              
defaultAs evidenced in the recent Deloitte 
defaultEconomic Impact of British Racing 2013
default, Briti
defaultsh Racing is not only the second-largest sport in the country in respect of revenues, employment and attendances – but is also an industry that 
defaultmakes a significant contribution
default to the wider rural economy, generating an annual economic impact of £3.45 billi
defaulton. 
defaultThe industry 
defaultdirectly 
defaultprovides over 20,000 full-time and part-time positions, 
defaultalongside many tens of thousands more jobs in related industries including veterinary and farriery services and the British Betting industry,
default in line with the Government’s ob
defaultjective of providing employment opportunities for population groups less likely to engage with the labour market in a full-time role.
default 
default1.3 
default              
defaultBritish Racing is unique amongst the most popular sports in the country in that it is the only sport where, on a dai
defaultly basis, women are able to compete on an equal basis with men in the same events. We are an equal opportunities sport.
default1.4 
default              
defaultWomen are involved in high-level and varied roles within the industry, including as participants (jockeys and trainers), stable sta
defaultff, at racecourses and in important positions within the sport’s governance and administration.
default2. default              defaultJockeysdefault2.1
default              
defaultFemale jockeys compete in the same races as their male counterparts (with
default 
default the exception of races held for lady Amateur riders and a lady riders
default-only race meeting at Carlisle held every August for charity) and have the full respect of their male counterparts in the weighing room. 
default2.2
default              
defaultFurthermore, female jockeys have successfully ridden winners at the highest level of the sport. Hayley Turner, who
default in 2008 became the first female jockey to ride over 1,000 winners in a season, has won two Group One Races (the highest class of Flat Race) in Great Britain – the Darley July Cup at Newmarket and the Coolmore Nunthorpe Stakes at York. In 2013, Katie Walsh
default became the first female to ride the favourite in the John Smith’s Grand National – having achieved a third place finish in the 2012 race.
default2.3
default              
defaultEncouraged by the success of jockeys like Hayley Turner and Katie Walsh, alongside others including Kirsty Milzar
defaulteck, Cathy Gannon and Amy Ryan, who in 2012 became the first ever female winner of the Apprentice Flat Jockeys’ title, female participation rates in the sport are healthy. While the number of Professional female jockeys remains relatively small, at approxi
defaultmately 11% of Flat Professional licences throughout 2013, this has grown slightly in recent years (9% in 2012). Moreover, 30% of Flat Amateur jockeys in 2013 are female while almost 70% of those holding Category A Flat Permits, 
defaultallowing them to compete in 
defaultAmateur Races, are held by women. Overall, at any one time in 2013, between 22% and 31% of all licence holders of any type are female.
default3.default              defaultTrainersdefault3.1
default              
defaultFemale participation in British Racing extends far beyond the parameters of the racecourse itself. The sp
defaultort has, past and present, and particularly in Jump Racing, bore witness to magnificent training performances by women – including Henrietta Knight, a licensed trainer for 23 years and winner of three consecutive Cheltenham Gold Cups with Best Mate from 20
default02-04, and Jenny Pitman, who in 1983 became the first female Grand National winning trainer with Corbiere. Furthermore, the 2013 Grand National winner, Aurora’s Encore, was trained by Sue Smith.
default3.2
default              
defaultAs of August 2013, 18% (102) of the 558 Trainers licensed
default to train thoroughbred racehorses by the BHA are female – alongside some 38% (45) of the 119 Permit (Amateur) Trainers also licensed by the BHA.
default4.default              defaultStable Staffdefault4.1
default              
defaultBritish Racing
default employs over 6,500 people to provide constant care and attention for the 14,
default000 horses in training
default in this country at any one time
default, providing them with a level of care and a quality of life that is virtually unsurpassed by
default any other domesticated animal. These staff perform a number of roles around licensed training yards including
default as Stable Lads and Lasses and Work Riders – assisting with the preparation of horses for racing alongside the running of the yard.  
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultAs of August 2013, 2,773 women are registered as a Stable Employee with the BHA – which is just over 40% of the 6,823
default strong workforce. Of these approximately 2,800 female employees, just over 57% work in a full-time position – and represent approximately one-third of full-time stable employees. Furthermore, the approximately 1,200 female part-time stable staff represent
default just over 56% of the registered part-time workforce in licensed yards.
default&#xa0;
default5.default              defaultRacecourses, Industry Administration and Governancedefault&#xa0;default5.1
default              
defaultThe British Racing industry also provides employment opportunities at all levels of seniority to women. 
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default              
defaultA number of 
defaultracecourses employ women in important business and racetrack management positions – with 16 of 58 racecourses (28%) in Great Britain having women as Managing Directors and 12 of 58 with women as Clerks of the Course. These include Amy Starkey, who having j
defaultoined the industry through the BHA Graduate Development Programme, is now Regional Manager – East for Jockey Club Racecourses, incorporating most notably Newmarket – the home of the QIPCO 1,000 and 2,000 Guineas, the first two Classic races of the season.
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default              
defaultWomen also hold senior positions within the governance of British Racing. The BHA Board has modern and effective sporting governance standards and meets many of the criteria as stipulated by Sport England in its funding requirements to National Govern
defaulting 
defaultBodies (BHA does not receive direct grant-aid funding from DCMS). Within this governance framework, there has been a female representative on the Board of the BHA at all times since its creation in 2007 from the merger of the Horseracing Regulatory Aut
defaulthority and British Horseracing Board. The current female representative on the Board is Morag Gray. One of the four Executives of the organisation, under Chief Executive Paul Bittar, is Ruth Quinn, Director of Racing and the BHA’s current Chief Veterinary 
defaultOfficer is Jenny Hall. 
default&#xa0;
default5.4
default              
defaultOutside of the BHA, women also hold a number of prominent positions within the principal stakeholder organisations in the sport. Rachel Hood, a successful human rights lawyer, is President of the Racehorse Owners Association. L
defaultouise Kemble is Chief Executive of the Thoroughbred Breeders’ Association – which represents the interest of thoroughbred racehorse breeders.
default&#xa0;
default6.default              defaultWomen in Racingdefault&#xa0;default6.1
default              
defaultIn September 2009, Women in Racing was founded by a cross-section of women working with t
defaulthe industry, with the aim of enhancing mentoring and development opportunities, developing cross-industry working groups and the chance to network in order to share knowledge and best practice. The organisation, in 
defaultits Mission Statement, intends “t
defaulto encour
defaultage senior appointments at Board level across the industry and to attract more women into Racing, to strengthen connections and collaborate on approaches to help promote the health of the sport and to enhance its reputation as an attractive sector in which
default to build a career.
default”
default&#xa0;
default6.2
default              
defaultIn February 2013, Women in Racing was awarded funding by 
defaultthe British Horseracing Grant Scheme, funded from the proceeds arising from the sale of the Tote and administered by the BHA on behalf of the Secretary of State for Culture,
default Media and Sport
default, to support the development of the organisation’s mentoring programme.
default 
default&#xa0;
default7.default              defaultBHA Graduate Development Programmedefault&#xa0;default7.1
default              
defaultFor more than two decades, British Racing has run an extremely successful Graduate Development Programme, which provides recent university leavers with the opportunity to learn about the industry and go on placement with a variety of employers including th
defaulte BHA, Racecourses, Trainers Yards, Studs and racing charities. There have been a number of successful female graduates on the programme in its history and, in the last ten years, 47% of graduates on it have been female. Furthermore, for seven of the last 
defaultten years, at least 50% of the graduates on the programme are women. These statistics demonstrate that the British Racing industry provides opportunities for all capable young graduates, regardless of their gender.
