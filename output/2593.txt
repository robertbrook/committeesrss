[[[&#xa0;]]]In relation to scrutiny of the Draft Deregulation Bill, the assertion that measures pertaining to the publication of targets for microgeneration systems installed, the inclusion of information about such targets, and repeal of the need to promote community energy projects, inter alia, are not required because the obligations are superseded by the Climate Change Act 2008 and the Sustainable and Secure Buildings Act 2004, is false. &#xa0;Based on my knowledge of research on energy technology policy and discursive approaches to institutional change, there are two points that I would like to make in support of this view. (a). Regulation may serve to stimulate market activity. The language of the bill seems to defer to the trope of regulation as a burden on business. Regulations are kinds of institutional rules, which may indeed have inertial effects but may signal the priorities of government/society. In this case the publication of targets for microgeneration is necessary to stimulate investment by providing investors with confidence in the direction of travel regarding the nurturing of the green economy. Similarly, there is a message being sent by repealing the need to promote community energy projects, namely that decentralized energy is not desirable, contrary to the many messages conveyed in governmental policies and initiatives of the past decade. The same goes for the idea of the active citizen/consumer (or big society). &#xa0;(ii). The two Acts contain some rather general catch-all statements, which could be interpreted as catering for pre-existing requirements and provisions, but actually serve to remove progress and projects associated with microgeneration and community energy from view.  For example the Sustainable Buildings Act 2004 refers to the requirement for the Secretary of State to report on building stock, and the extent to which energy efficiency is improved and greenhouse gas emissions are reduced, as well as the ‘extent to which they have their own facilities for generating energy’, though not explicitly on microgeneration or community energy. The Climate Change Act 2008 refers to activities, targets and progress in reducing emissions, and in general to energy generation technologies, social and economic circumstances but not directly to microgeneration and community energy. In this way, these Acts are telling with regard to what they do not say – entailing a discourse of ‘not’ microgeneration and ‘not community energy’. This would seem to discourage and to disadvantage small firms, communities and potential household efforts to generate (e.g.) electricity – and at a time when there is great concern with opening up of UK energy markets, which many commentators and analysts consider to be quite stodgy and lacking in competitiveness. &#xa0;It is my view that in fact the relevant measures have not been superseded effectively by the Climate Change Act 2008 and Sustainable Buildings Act 2004. The measures contained in prior legislation should not be dispensed with, and need to be retained for the reasons alluded to above. &#xa0;Audley Genus, Professor of Innovation and Technology Management, Small Business Research Centre, Kingston University&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
