default1   There must be closer scrutiny of the figures submitted by applicants for funding agreements. As politicians you will be well aware of how statistics can be manipulated. Respondents to consultation documents can be 
defaultpersuaded to give positive feedback if incentives are on offer. The free schools group has a staff of 100+  and the number of applicants is not overwhelming so it should be possible to put at least one independent representative on the ground to oversee th
defaulte procedure of collecting data to show a need for a school in the area.

default2  There must be a set budget for new build schools which would include the cost of site purchase, consultant fees, road improvements and any conditions set by local planning authorit
defaulties. Despite the value for money condition there does not appear to be any maximum figure set. Applicants should submit a figure which would be strictly adhered to, ruling out the possibility of landowners being offered figures well in excess of current ma
defaultrket value to ensure procurement of a site. The funding agency cannot agree to fund a school if they do not know the total cost.

default3  Brown field sites must be used when available and be as near as possible to the major catchment areas to reduce transport c
defaultosts and ensure sustainability. There should be no interference by the secretary of state in the planning procedure, local authority decisions to be final.
