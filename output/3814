[normal] money is insufficient  to achieve the desired improvement for disadvantaged pupils (Sibieta, 2009)
[normal];
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]the money is i
[normal]nsufficient to incentivise the best schools to take additional FSM pupils, given the high-stakes nature of league tables and other performance indicators.

[normal]Quality of activities undertaken by schools
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]All of these can be improved to some extent, though 
[normal]this may be circumscribed by a)
[normal] amount available to spend, and 
[normal]b) 
[normal]the 
[normal]counter-incentives 
[normal]of performance indicators 
[normal](
[normal]the Government’s 
[normal]new performance indicators may help, to some extent). But fundamentally, 
[normal]the scale of challenge is also enormous: 
[normal]the level
[normal] of financial and social 
[normal]capital inequality between families cannot
[normal] simply be compensated 
[normal]for 
[normal]by school
[normal]s
[normal] alone
[normal].

[normal] See e.g. Dunne et al. 2007. Disadvantaged pupils are likely to be placed in low sets and streams because they arrive with lower achievement. However, research has shown that teacher perception may play a part in such allocation, and also that low sets ten
[normal]d to suffer 
[normal]from poor quality teaching (Ireson
[normal] &amp; Hallam
[normal], 2001
[normal]).

[normal] regularly observed by Michael Gove (e.g. Gove 2011).
[normal] Wherein social segregation is shown to be especially strong.
[normal] See also Moss’ work on boys and literacy.
[normal] As the 
[normal]UK has traditionally maintained a strong, hierarchised distinction between vocational and academic routes. 
[normal] 
[normal]The Pupil Premium is set to 
[normal]increase
[normal] to 2.5bn in 2014-15,
[normal] but even so the sums involved are smaller than originally recommended by the Sutton Trus
[normal]t (2010a) and Liberal 
[normal]Democrat manifesto, and in comparison with similar international initiatives such as the Harlem Children’s Zone project.
[normal] Sibieta (2009) estimated that the cost for getting the attainment of poor children up to the national average wou
[normal]ld require the pupil premium to be set at over £25,000 per pupil.
[normal] In the US, charter agreements are between 3-5 years duration.
[normal] This and the above three recommendations were all made by the Academies Commission (2013).
[normal] This recommendation has been ma
[normal]de by West et al (2009), the Academies Commission (2013), and Francis (for ASCL, 2013).
