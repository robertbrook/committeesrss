default Introduction
default 
default&#xa0;
default1.
default1
default  In compiling this response, we have assumed that it will be regarded as an external
default, 
defaultpartial
default view of internal Government and Civil Service processes.  The people best placed to give detailed answers to the questions in your inquiry are Ministers and civil servants.
default&#xa0;
default1.
default2
default  The remit of ITS (UK) 
default(see paragraph 8.1) 
defaultmeans that our knowledge of
default Government horizon scanning activities is limited to the transport sector and
default mainly
default to the activities of DfT, BIS and the Highways Agency.  Within these limitations, our experience is considerable, with Members reporting involvement with Government horiz
defaulton scanning activities covering the last thirty years or so. 
default Please bear in mind that some Government bodies use the term “Intelligent Mobility” for what we call “Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS)”.
default&#xa0;
default1.3  We would like to make the general point that the
default outputs from state-funded horizon scanning work should be made available to the public to read within a sensible time frame, unless publication carries evident risks in areas such as defence or security.  A risk of negative publicity for Government is not
default a valid reason for not publishing.
default  It would not be surprising if the lack of openness about horizon scanning results in responses to this inquiry being unduly negative
default or incompletely informed
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.4  Making the results of horizon scanning available to in
defaultterested parties as a matter of routine will also help mitigate the effects of the Civil Service career structure on the longevity of this work.  Private sector professionals tend to stay in their profession, and once aware of a study will keep referring t
defaulto it, keeping the knowledge alive.  Civil servants move from topic to topic in their careers, and “reading up” on the previous ten years of departmental research activity in their new area of work does not seem to be part of their induction into new posts.
default1.
default5
default  DfT is commissioning infrastructure projects for fifty years ahead – such as HS2 – and better communication of the horizon scanning would probably ease the stakeholder engagement required for those projects.
default&#xa0;
default2
default.0  
defaultHow do Government departments make 
defaultuse of horizon scanning?
default&#xa0;
default2.1  
defaultMembers 
defaultwho have had 
defaultinvolvement with 
defaulthorizon scanning studies 
defaultsuggest
default that Government 
defaultcan be
default reluctant to work at the 
defaulthorizon because 
defaultby definition such work will lack credible detail such as exact costs and timing.  It is ha
defaultbitually ridiculed in the UK media which makes it unattractive to politicians and th
defaulterefore to th
defaultose who work for them.  
defaultThe horizon scanning is too often not 
defaultlocked in to internal strategic thinking and option 
defaultanalysis.  It follows that some 
defaultwork which is
default passed off as 
defaulthorizon scanning is actually looking at new technologies and societal tre
defaultnds which are already present, or in other words 
defaultmuch nearer than the
default horizon at the time of the study
default (and therefore a safer subject)
default.  There seems to be a lack of acceptance that the conclusions of genuine horizon scanning work will sometimes turn out to be completely wrong, but that this is not a reason not to do it, or evidence of lack of competence by its authors.  
default 
defaultIt might well be
default the case that the completion of a scanning exercise has in itself delivered new knowledge or that the use of back-casting (working backwards from a future scenario to determine what would be the early signs of an unwelcome trend) has reinforced planning a
defaultnd strategic thinking more widely.
default&#xa0;
default2.2  
defaultOne example is the 
defaultCyber Trust 
defaultwork done in 2003 on scenari
defaultos 
defaultfor 
default2018.   
defaultAt the time, some of the conclusions were welcomed, but there was also criticism of perceived s
defaultcaremongering
default.  However, two of these predicti
defaultons came true some time ago:  
defaultpervasive computing has arrived; 
defaultand 
defaultthe Chinese Government 
defaultapproach to IT 
defaultsecurity 
defaultmirrors the predictions in the report.
default&#xa0;
default2.3  
defaultAnother is the Foresight 2005 look at 
defaultIntelligent Infrastructure scenarios 
defaultfor 
default50 years
default hence.  This work was ambitious and detailed, and respectfully received by the 
defaulttransport
default community at least, but it appears to have had little 
defaultlasting 
defaultimpact on 
defaultsubsequent 
defaultpolicy
default.  
default&#xa0;
default2.4  
defaultA fourth example is the road mapping for transport policy undertake
defaultn by the Transport KTN and the Automotive Council, both organisations set up by BIS.  Industry has had a lot of involvement in this work.  Other Government departments do not appear to be making use of this resource
default 
default– or to be involved in the work – even t
defaulthough for instance DfT is far more concerned with transport policy than BIS.  The Day Review proposals for better cross-Department coordination are necessary and we welcome them.
default&#xa0;
default3.0  
defaultHow effective is horizon scanning in Government? Do Ministers and 
defaultsenior officials consider horizon scanning outputs appropriately
default?
default&#xa0;
default3.1  
defaultSee also response to Q1.  
default&#xa0;
default3.2  
defaultThere is a common failing within Departments in that the lack of scientific or 
defaultengineering literacy among many senior policy makers means that the significance of actual or potential technology developments is not recognised or, when brought to their attention, not understood.  
defaultThi
defaults
default is as likely to be due to the findings not being pr
defaultesented in a suitable format, as to the recipient not having the knowledge to understand them.  
defaultThe proposed changes to the Horizon Scanning governance will not do anything to address these points.
default&#xa0;
default3.3  
defaultWhen horizon sc
defaultanning is undertaken, there can be 
defaulta 
defaultdisconnect between the outputs of 
defaultthe study 
defaultand what action is taken next. This may be because
default t
defaulthe costs, benefits and risks are difficult to quantify so it 
defaultis 
defaulteasier to ignore 
defaultthe study, and possible to ignore it unless it was undertaken as a result of a 
defaultstrong political imperative
default.
default   Taking this option  is unfortunately not preceded by quantifying the risks of ignoring the 
defaultstudy as well as quantifying the risks of acting on it.  
defaultGovernment
default need
defaults
default to consider how to quantify these risks accurately.  
defaultTaking 
defaultthe short term approach needs to be designed out of the process.  
default&#xa0;
default4.0  
defaultWhat changes could be made to improve existing horizon scanning activity? Will the recommendations made in Jon Day’s review of cross-government horizon scanning capability address cur
defaultrent shortcomings? 
defaultWhat progress has been made implementing these?
default&#xa0;
default4.1  
defaultPeople who have been involved in Foresight reviews (very similar, but not identical, to Horizon Scanning) have noted the additional vigour regarding follow-up and regular post hoc 
defaultmonitoring when a Minister has been involved as Principal Client.  There has been very uneven practice regarding publicity and the opportunity for open debate on studies and their findings
default.  T
defaulthe allegation that for many studies
default 
defaultthe analytic community has e
defaultnjoyed the chase rather than the capture is probably correct.
default&#xa0;
default5.0  How effective is the Government at responding 
defaultto policy or regulatory challeng
defaultes presented by new technologies?
default&#xa0;
default5.1  
defaultSee also response to Q1
default at paragraph 3.2
default  
default&#xa0;
default5.2  
defaultGovernment has 
defaultsometimes
default been too slow and too private
default,
default not least because Chief Scientific Advisers are only loosely tied in to top level strategy and planning in many Departments. 
defaultAs a general point Departments have too 
defaultfew external advisory bodies – relatively informal
default bodies operating at about Deputy Director level to discuss technology movements, industry  trends, what scientific developments might mature into engineering products or processes etc and thus acting as the very early detectors of issues where a more stru
defaultctured approach would be justified.  
default&#xa0;
default5.3  
defaultThere are particular problems in transport where the fact that delivery rests with Local Authorities and Industry has been seen as a reason to justify too much inactivity regarding tactical technology 
defaultthinking.
default  
defaultThe reduction in research carried out by DfT and the HA in the area of transport technology leads to Local Authorities trying to cope with a hands-off, localism agenda with less support from the centre and less internal resources.  This combination of 
defaultcirc
defaultumstances, unless addressed,  will lead to the UK being able to benefit less from new transport technology in the future.
default&#xa0;
default5.4  
defaultWith particular regard to DfT, maybe it is 
defaultunique in having a remit over an arena with such a mix of government money, 
defaultregulation and private money
default.  
default Where else does something driven by global market development and paid for by the user – the car – interact with publicly funded infrastructure? That does mak
defaulte it particularly challenging.  
defaultBut 
defaultit 
defaultalso raises the importance 
defaultof getting it right. 
default&#xa0;
default5.5  
defaultA linked point 
defaultis that
default in other policy areas, the horizon scanning and policy proposals seem to come from think tanks
default and similar bodies
default. 
defaultT
defaulto some extent that happens 
defaultalso in transport with, for example, the RAC F
defaultoundation. But 
defaultthe transport policy area seems poorly served compared to some other policy areas
default.
default&#xa0;
default6.0  Case study:  
defaultautonomous road vehicles and intelligent transport infrastructure:
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat are (or were) the policy challenges presented by this technology? How have these 
defaultchallenges been identified?
default&#xa0;
default6.1
default  As an example, the Cooperative Vehicle Highways Systems study undertaken by AECOM for DfT 
defaultaround the middle of the last decade 
defaultoutlined these clearly 
defaultbut the recommendations for research monitoring were not carried out. Following 
defaultthe 
defaultdeparture of 
defaultthe 
defaultDfT staff 
defaultwho were the clients for the study, there was 
defaultlittle 
defaultevidence of the matter receiving further consideration
default for several years
default.  Contact with the ITS (UK) CVHS Interest Group, which had been important in keeping DfT staff up to date with international developments, was also 
defaultseverely reduced.  
default(See also paragraph 1.4)
default&#xa0;
default6.2  
defaultDfT have very recently engaged again,
default with plans to commi
defaultssion consultancy work on automated platooning of vehicles and undertake trials.  
defaultHowever, the disconnect between these pieces of work shows a lack of continuity of foresight and planning.
default 
defaultThe recent UK work on 
defaultautonomous vehicles, 
defaultsuch as
default the IET publishing a case study and the 
defaultEPSRC supporting
default the Oxford robotic car work led by Professor Paul Newman
default, is not 
defaultobviously linked to DfT and the study it commissioned (see para 6.1).
default&#xa0;
defaultH
defaultow prepared is (or was) the Government to react to challenges
default presented by this technology? How effective was this reaction?
default&#xa0;
default6.3
default  
defaultThe plan for watching the horizon was there (with triggers that showed the changes were coming) along with a plan to react but the work seemed to be on a shelf rather than used by DfT. When information 
defaultis
default required now 
defaultit is 
defaultgiven on a voluntary basis via I
defaultTS 
default(
defaultUK
default), which we are very happy to do, but 
default 
defaultsince DfT paid for the study it is wasteful not to refer to it.
default&#xa0;
default6.4
default  
defaultThe UK activity can be contrasted with the Dutch Government which also employed horizon scanning in the area of cooperative systems, but then
default demonstrated a continuous interest and commitment to ensuring the Netherlands remained at the forefront of this development.  See

default.0  Summary
default&#xa0;
default7
default.1  
defaultThe basic premise seems to 
defaultbe that there is a lack of horizon scanning capability in the Civil Service, whose role is “…to meet both the challenges of the day and be mindful of the longer term.  It is a Civil Service responsibility to
default look beyond the parliamentary t
defaulterm and so day to
default day issues and short term politics should not drive the horizon scanning agenda”.  But successful policy analysis and thinking demands two additional inputs:  Ministers and their Special Advisers, and Industry especially the 
defaultindustries that supply product
defaults and services to deliver Government policies and targets (Health, Transport, Defence, for example).
defaultThis report and the incorporated recommendations ignore these elements and the interpretation of senior customers as confined to Permanent Secretaries 
defaultet a
defaultl
default is too narrow.

default8.0  About ITS United Kingdom 
default&#xa0;
default8.1
default              
default ITS United Kingdom, referred to 
defaultin this document
default as ITS (UK), is a ‘not-for-profit’ public/private sector association financed by members' subscriptions providing a forum for all organisations concerned with ITS.  The Society works to bring the advantages that ITS can offer in terms of economic efficien
defaultcy, transport safety, and environmental benefits to the United Kingdom.  The Membership of over 150 UK organisations comprises Government Departments, Local Authorities, Police Forces, consultancies, manufacturing and service companies, and academic and re
defaultsearch institutions.  ITS United Kingdom encourages discussion on issues such as public/private co-operation, standards, legislation, information provision and new technology.  ITS (UK) was a key contributor to the Parliamentary POSTNote 322 ‘Intelligent T
defaultransport Systems’ published in January 2009.  
default&#xa0;
default8.2
default  Intelligent Transport Systems, “ITS”, is the term used to describe combinations of sensors, telecoms, information processing and location referencing to deliver improved transport systems and services in
defaultcluding information before and during a trip for travellers by all modes.  Some examples: ITS can improve the efficiency of transport through traffic control and enforcement of traffic regulations and enhance road safety through in-vehicle systems for coll
defaultision avoidance and better lane keeping.  Many commercial organisations use ITS to manage vehicle fleets, both freight and passenger, through the provision of real-time information and two way communication between manager and driver.  Electronic ticketing
default (by means of Smartcards, for example) enables faster, easier travel by public transport.  In addition Intelligent Transport Systems have beneficial effects on the environment by reducing air and noise pollution on highways and by helping to create traffic
default free zones in cities.
