"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by John Edgar Cameron Lowe [OLS0019]&#xa0;&#xa0;ONLINE SAFETY OF CHILDREN&#xa0;\nThank you for this enquiry and allowing some of us to make a submission.\n&#xa0;\nI write in a personal capacity a\ns\n one who, with my wife, \nhave\n constant contact with children through the church.\n&#xa0;\nSex is a very powerful force in \nmany people`s lives.\n&#xa0;\nWhen in it`s proper setting of raising children it is a good and right thing.\n&#xa0;\nWhen out of it`s setting it is like fire out of control and does damage.\n&#xa0;\nI have personally been damaged by adult material although this was in an age befo\nre the advent of the internet. I have felt the effects of this damage throughout the rest of my life.\n&#xa0;\nToday the chances of children being damaged are enormous compared to years ago. I therefore fully agree with David Cameron , Michael Gove and others\n, tha\nt every possible effort should be made to get government, parents, internet providers, educators and charities to work together to provide all the protections necessary to safeguard them from the many different types of sexual corruption available online.\n&#xa0;\nIt is surely a crime to shatter the innocence of children and young\n people.\n&#xa0;\nThere is a solemn piece on the last page of the Bible that speaks of those that love and make a lie.\n&#xa0;\nThose that \nmake \na lie are those that set up and publish these damaging and \nvile things.\n&#xa0;\nThose that \nlove \na lie are those that\n delve into and watch them.\n&#xa0;\nAs responsible citizens\n,\n as many as possible need to do everything they can to address this massive problem.\n&#xa0;\nMay you all be helped in your \ndeliberations.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
