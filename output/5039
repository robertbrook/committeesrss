[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence from 
[normal]British Retail Consortium
[normal] [PCC Progress 29]
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The British Retail Consortium (BRC) welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the
[normal] Home Affairs Select Committee
[normal] inquiry into the work and effectiveness of Police and Crime Commissioners.   This paper briefly summarises the 
[normal]BRC’s views, which are most relevant to the following strands of the Committee’s inquiry: 
[normal]About The BR[bold]C[bold]The 
[normal]BRC 
[normal]is the lead trade association for the retail sector and the authoritative voice of the industry. We bring toge
[normal]ther a 
[normal]whole range of retailers across the UK, from small independents to large multiples and department stores, selling a wide range of products through high street, out of town, neighbourhood, rural and online stores.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The level of c
[normal]rime committed against businesses is significant and 
[normal]continues
[normal] to be of real concern to BRC members.
[normal]  
[normal]Analysis 
[normal]carried out by the 
[normal]by the Metropolitan Police
[normal] 
[normal]for the Mayor’s Office
[normal] found that in 2012/13, businesses were 
[normal]the 
[normal]victims of 15% of all reported crime in
[normal] London
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We are in the process of analysing the results of the 
[normal]BRC Annual R
[normal]etail Crime Survey
[normal] for 2013.  T
[normal]he last report, published earli
[normal]er this year, 
[normal]found that in 2011-12:  
[normal]2.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Despite the level of retail crime, 
[normal]tackling 
[normal]it is often not considered a priority by law enforcement and retailers 
[normal]remain
[normal] frustrated about the often poor response they receive to 
[normal]reported 
[normal]crimes.  Crimes committed against retailers, such as shop 
[normal]theft
[normal], are still 
[normal]perceived
[normal] by many as 'victimless'.  Such a view fails to 
[normal]recognise
[normal] the importance of the retail sector to local communities and the fact
[normal] that the same offenders target
[normal]ing shops 
[normal]often 
[normal]commit other crimes in their local areas.  
[normal]It also fails to recognise the impact on employees themselves.  
[normal]Local perceptions of 
[normal]crime and criminality are undoubtedly shaped by what people experience in their shopping centres and local stores.    
[normal]Measuring business crime [bold]2.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A fundamental problem with assessing the impact of business crime 
[normal]i
[normal]s that there is no agreed definition of it
[normal].  
[normal]We cannot fight 
[normal]it 
[normal]effectively until the true scale of the problem is measured and understood.   
[normal]This is why the BRC fully supports the work by DCC Sue Fish, ACPO lead for Business Crime, to introduce a single, national 
[normal]business crime 
[normal]definition.
[normal]  
[normal]This, along with the capability of police forces to ‘tag’ such crime on their recording systems, would represent a major step forward. It 
[normal]would 
[normal]allow 
[normal]there to be 
[normal]focused partnership
[normal]s
[normal] between businesses and the police to tackle retail crime, utilising resources more effectively to target hot spots within each force area.
[normal]2.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]If this definition is introduced by ACPO, we would expect PCCs to 
[normal]help 
[normal]ensure that their police forces implement 
[normal]it 
[normal]as soon as possible and have in place the necessary 
[normal]IT 
[normal]software to start recording and measuring business crime.  
[normal]In time, w
[normal]e would like to see business crime statistics published by each
[normal] police force in the same way that
[normal] other crime data is routinely m
[normal]ade available. 
[normal]3.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The BRC 
[normal]supported 
[normal]the introduction of elected P
[normal]olice and 
[normal]C
[normal]rime 
[normal]C
[normal]ommissioners
[normal].  We undertook a range of work both before and after the PCC elections to 
[normal]explain 
[normal]how, 
[normal]through working with retail
[normal]ers, PCCs can help to cut crime
[normal] affecting local communities.  The BRC
[normal] produced guidance for PCC 
[normal]candidates
[normal], 
[normal]and held 
[normal]a number of meetings with individual PCCs to discuss retail crime. 
[normal]Business Crime in PCC Police and Crime Plans [bold]3.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Earlier this year the BRC conducted an informal review of 
[normal]published 
[normal]PCC Police and 
[normal]Crime Plans for 2013-17, to examine the extent of 
[normal]commitments 
[normal]within them 
[normal]to tackle business crime and retail crime 
[normal]i
[normal]n particular.  
[normal]3.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The majority of the Police and Crime Commissioners have recognised 
[normal]in some way 
[normal]the 
[normal]need to work 
[normal]with businesses in their Plans. Out of the 41 newly elected Commissioners, over half of them (27) refer to engaging with business as part of their crime fighting strategy. 
[normal]3.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However the degree
[normal] to which PCCs 
[normal]set out specific proposals to tackle
[normal] crimes affecting 
[normal]businesses 
[normal]varies greatly, 
[normal]from 
[normal]brief 
[normal]reference
[normal]s
[normal] to 
[normal]consulting 
[normal]with 
[normal]business to more detailed commitments about specifically working with retailers to tackle crime affecting them.

[normal]London: A dedicated Business Crime Strategy [bold]3.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]On 26 November the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime published a consultation on a business crime s
[normal]trategy for London
[normal].
[normal]  The BRC very much welcomes this and had been engaged
[normal] in the early stages of the 
[normal]consultation process 
[normal]to help 
[normal]shape the 
[normal]stra
[normal]t
[normal]egy
[normal].  
[normal]If delivered, 
[normal]the 
[normal]proposals within the draft strategy would represent a significant step forward in how business crime is tackled, such as: 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The BRC would like to see the production of a dedicated business crime strategy replicated by PCCs elsewhere. Whilst t
[normal]he
[normal] strategy is still in development and crucial 
[normal]issues such 
[normal]how 
[normal]operational delivery 
[normal]will be achieved have yet to be resolved
[normal], the 
[normal]approach being taken in London is a very positive one. 
[normal]4.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A specific example of where PCCs could help to deliver improvements for retailers is in relation to
[normal] the police response to fraud, 
[normal]a
[normal]n issue of
[normal] major concern 
[normal]for the sector
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]The introduction of 
[normal]Action Fraud
[normal] in April 2013 created a single, central reporting centre for fraud.   Action Fraud feeds reports of fraud into the NFIB for further analysis, which then sends cases out to local police forces for further action.  
[normal]However 
[normal]from an enforcement perspective
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]new 
[normal]process is 
[normal]failing 
[normal]retailers, 
[normal]for the following reasons:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The extent of the problem is made clear in t
[normal]he MOPAC consultation 
[normal]document.  In London of the solvable fraud reports which have been sent out from the NFIB to the MPS for further action since the inception of Action Fraud, just 3% have been solved.
[normal]  
[normal]4.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Retailers would like PCCs to 
[normal]work with their local police forces to improve their response to 
[normal]fraud
[normal] and deliver improvements for businesses in this area. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Set out below are 
[normal]the BRCs 
[normal]recommendations for how PCCs could 
[normal]help to 
[normal]reduce 
[normal]retail
[normal] 
[normal]crime more effectively
[normal].
