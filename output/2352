defaultWritten evidence submitted by defaultRenfrewshire Council default1.1.
default 
default              
defaultRenfrewshire Council continues to express concerns that the reforms to support for 
default              
defaulthousing costs being considered by this inquiry will exacerbate poverty for the most 
default              
defaultvulnerable individuals and families. 
default1.2.
default 
default              
defaultThe Renfrewshire area includes the Ferguslie area of Paisley, the single most deprived 
default              
defaultdatazone in Scotland (see the Ren
defaultfrewshire c
defaultontext - Appendix 1
default, A). This area and 
default              
defaultother more vulnerable communities in Renfrewshire already face significant challenges 
default              
defaultand the measures being introduced by the UK Government will lead to increased 
default              
defaultfinancial stress for households and create additio
defaultnal service pressures arising from 
default              
defaultdemand for welfare, debt and money advice, additional family distress and increased 
default              
defaulthomelessness presentations.
default1.3.
default 
default              
defaultFrom the Council’s perspective there are clear financial risks relating to the 
default              
defaultmanagement and sustainabil
defaultity of the Housing Revenue Account (HRA). These are 
default              
defaultlinked to increases in rent collection costs and bad debts associated with an increasing 
default              
defaultrequirement to collect rent as a result of reducing benefit levels available to tenants and 
default              
defaultproposals for housin
defaultg benefit payments to be made directly to the claimant under the 
default              
defaultproposed Universal Credit system.
default1.4.
default 
default              
defaultAdditionally, the Council is concerned that the make up and availability of housing stock 
default              
defaultat local authority level does not appear to have been taken into
default account when 
default              
defaultintroducing the under 
defaultoccupancy reduction. (Appendix 1
default, B) refers. This places 
default              
defaultsignificant challenges for social landlords, including Renfrewshire Council where there 
default              
defaultis a mismatch between the housing requirements of tenants affected by th
defaulte under 
default              
defaultoccupancy reduction and the benefit cap and the availability of suitably sized stock. 
default1.5.
default 
default              
defaultRenfrewshire Council anticipates a number of potential impacts on its statutory duty in 
default              
defaultrelation to homelessness as a result of the Housing Benefit changes. I
defaultn particular, the 
default              
defaultapplication of the under occupancy reduction to local authority owned stock used to 
default              
defaulttemporarily accommodate people presenting as homeless, while exempting other 
default              
defaulttenures of property used, does not recognise the effective use that is mad
defaulte of LA 
default              
defaultowned accommodation to meet such emergency accommodation needs.  The loss of 
default              
defaulthousing benefit and the resulting increase in rent arrears may ultimately lead to 
default              
defaultincreased housing benefit costs as the council may be forced to consider greater use o
defaultf 
default              
defaultthe private sector provision, where rent levels may prove to be higher, in order to meet 
default              
defaultits statutory duties in relation to homelessness and protect against financial loss to the 
default              
defaultCouncil. 
default1.6.
default 
default              
defaultThe proposed introduction of direct payment of housing costs
default within Universal Credit is 
default              
defaultexpected to lead to greater financial stress for households and individuals and will place 
default              
defaultextreme financial pressures on the long term sustainability of social housing where 
default              
defaulthouseholds are unable to budget appropriately and 
defaultmanage the ongoing responsibility 
default              
defaultof sustaining their rent payments.
default2.1.
default 
default              
defaultRenfrewshire Council has deployed significant additional r
defaultesources of £1.3 million in 
default              
default2013/14 and beyond to provide the Council with the best opportunity to prepare for and 
default              
defaultmanage the anticipated increase in demand for services. Much of this investment is 
default              
defaultdirected towards advice and support to ensure the Counc
defaultil is well placed to both 
default              
defaultsupport the tenants and their families manage the impact of welfare change, but also to 
default              
defaultseek to pro-actively protect the financial position of the Council’s housing function, in 
default              
defaultparticular the sustainability of its rental strea
defaultm during this transition.
default2.2.
default 
default              
defaultRenfrewshire Council has formally recognised that where tenants subject to the under 
default              
defaultoccupancy reduction are actively engaged with the Council and are taking reasonable 
default              
defaultsteps to maintain a rent repayment arrangement the council
default will continue to pursue rent 
default              
defaultdue without resorting to eviction. However, it needs to be recognised that increasing 
default              
defaultrental arrears ultimately places significant financial pressures on the Council’s Housing 
default              
defaultRevenue Account which will in turn increase the
default associated future rental costs for social 
default              
defaulthousing within Renfrewshire. 
default2.3.
default 
default              
defaultIn recognition of this, the Council has in addition,  agreed to set aside £850,000 from 
default              
defaultthe Housing Revenue Account (HRA) for 2013/14 to help mitigate the impacts of 
default              
defaultwelfare refor
defaultm on Council tenants, part of which will be targeted at providing a scheme 
default              
defaultof financial support for tenants experiencing hardship. Given the close links with the 
default              
defaultDepartment for Work and Pensions (DWP) Discretionary Housing Payment (DHP) 
default              
defaultscheme, options 
defaultfor criteria for the HRA financial hardship support scheme are being 
default              
defaultdeveloped taking account of the circumstances and outcomes of applications made by 
default              
defaulttenants for DHP. However, it is recognised that both schemes will provide only 
default              
defaulttemporary support and 
defaultrelief for affected tenants.
default2.4.
default 
default              
defaultIn addition, Renfrewshire Council has increased its top up funding to DHP resources by 
default              
default150% by allocating an additional £150,000 to the DHP fund for 2013/14 in recognition 
default              
defaultthat the DWP resources are insufficient to provide t
defaulthe necessary short term support to 
default              
defaultaffected citizens across Renfrewshire. The Council administration is proposing to 
default              
defaultfurther enhance the fund up to the maximum allowable at the C
defaultouncil meeting 
default              
defaultscheduled for 3
default October 2013. The enhanced fund will help de
defaultfray the loss of 
default              
defaultHousing Benefit and provide tenants with short term support that will allow them to 
default              
defaultmeet their rent obligations while considering other options.
default2.5.
default 
default              
defaultThe integration of housing officers to neighbourhood area housing teams has also been 
default              
defaulttake
defaultn forward by the Council in order to support ongoing tenancy management 
default              
defaultactivities. Officers continue to take proactive measures to support tenants affected and 
default              
defaultwe have increased the number of officers available to offer advice and assistance, 
default              
defaultincluding
default specialist money advice to make sure that tenants have access to good 
default              
defaultadvice and support.  This includes maximising any opportunity to access benefit 
default              
defaultentitlement, support access to any possible financial support funds in place, and also 
default              
defaultcovers repaymen
defaultt planning and referral to training and employment services. 
default2.6.
default 
default              
defaultInterest in Mutual Exchanges has increased and good progress is being made in 
default              
defaultpartnership with Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) to develop a Housing Options 
default              
defaultshop which is scheduled to be op
defaulterational during October 2013. The focus will be on 
default              
defaultsupporting and facilitating exchanges where tenants have expressed and interest in 
default              
defaultthis.
default2.7.
default 
default              
defaultInvest in Renfrewshire is the Council’s flagship programme to tackle unemployment and 
default              
defaultimprove employability wit
defaulth in Renfrewshire. This programme
default              
default supported a Welfare 
default              
defaultReform training programme within Housing Services for young people between the 
default              
defaultages of 16 and 25. The programme funded the recruitment and supported the training 
default              
defaultof a team of unemployed to support t
defaulthe initial phases of the contact with tenants 
default              
defaultaffected by the under occupancy reduction, a second programme is currently underway 
default              
defaultwith the team focusing on a wider group of council tenants and their households.  The 
default              
defaultfirst programme resulted in all but o
defaultne of the young participants progressing to 
default              
defaultemployment or further education.
default2.8.
default 
default              
defaultHousing options advice has been extended to include employment sign posting and 
default              
defaultrelevant housing staff have been trained and plans are being progressed to deploy an 
default              
defaultemployment
default adviser dedicated to support unemployed tenants.  
default3.1.
default 
default              
defaultBoth local authority and RSL housing stock is in significant demand as evidenced by 
default              
defaultthe waiting lists, owner occupation is very diffi
defaultcult to access at present due to high 
default              
defaultpurchase prices, the requirement for large deposits and the lack of availability of 
default              
defaultmortgage finance. The Council is already aware that tenants impacted are Housing 
default              
defaultBenefit claimants and this is unlikely to be an op
defaulttion available to them. 
default3.2.
default 
default              
defaultIn Renfrewshire a Housing Options approach is in place; as part of housing advice 
default              
defaultservices, tenants and applicants are given an overview of all housing options available 
default              
defaultto them, including discussions around alternative tenures including the private rented 
default              
defaultsector.
default3.3.
default 
default              
defaultThe private rented sector is relatively smaller compared to other tenures and wider 
default              
defaultwelfare reforms will also make this sector more difficult to access. Tenan
defaultts leaving their 
default              
defaultcurrent homes may end up staying with family or friends or present as homeless putting 
default              
defaultgreater pressure on existing services.
default3.4.
default 
default              
defaultShelter Scotland, have indicated that people judged to be under-occupying in the social 
default              
defaultsector and who can't 
defaultafford the shortfall, will be forced with the choice to downsize or 
default              
defaultrun up arrears. Due to the widely recognised chronic shortage of one-bedroom social 
default              
defaulthouses, the charity says many will have to turn to the private rented sector. In 
default              
defaultRenfrewshire the exi
defaultstence of the required number of one bed room private rented 
default              
defaultproperties is questionable.
default3.5.
default 
default              
defaultAs highlighted in tables 1 and 2 in Appendix 
default1
default, rent for a one-bedroom property in the 
default              
defaultprivate sector is on average higher than rent for a two-bedroom social proper
defaultty. 
default              
defaultTenants electing to transition to a private tenancy as means to alleviate the impact of 
default              
defaultunder occupancy rules on a social tenancy, would qualify for full Local Housing 
default              
defaultAllowance (LHA) as they would no longer be assessed as under-occupying – 
default              
defaultpervers
defaultely this would be costing the public purse more in terms of providing housing 
default              
defaultcosts support than it would to provide full benefit support for a social rented property 
default              
defaultwithout any associated under occupancy reduction.
defaultUnder occupancy reductiondefault4.1.
default 
default              
defaultThe removal of the spare room subsidy, or the bedroom tax, as it is more commonly 
default              
defaultknown, has introduced deductions from housing benefit on tenants who are deemed to 
default              
defaulthave more bedrooms than they need. As referred to ea
defaultrlier, options for tenants in 
default              
defaultthis situation are limited as the housing stock in the area does not match the associated 
default              
defaultdemand for smaller one bedroom properties and with many affected tenants advising 
default              
defaultthe Council that they  have no way of making up the
default shortfall. 
default4.2.
default 
default              
defaultAt the point of implementation of the under occupancy reduction, a total of 1,960 
default              
defaultCouncil tenants lost £1.2 million a year in housing benefit (as detailed in table 3, 
default              
defaultAppendix 1
default) and 1,100 Housing Association tenants lost £0.6 million a yea
defaultr in housing 
default              
defaultbenefit. It is anticipated that a major component of this loss in benefit will lead to a 
default              
defaultreduction in rental income for both the Council and Registered Social Landlords (RSLs). 
default4.3.
default 
default              
defaultBased on data from the end of July 2013, July the number of te
defaultnants affected by Under 
default              
defaultOccupancy and in arrears has risen to 1,464, with only 27% of households affected 
default              
defaultmaintaining a clear rent account. The increase in rent arrears since the start of the 
default              
defaultfinancial year and introduction of the under occupancy reduct
defaultion is £229,000. This is 
default              
defaultdespite the proactive attempts of the Council to inform and support tenants through the 
default              
defaultchanges and places significant financial risks on the potential to recover unpaid rent 
default              
defaultgoing forward.
default4.4.
default 
default              
defaultThe 2013/14 HRA Business Plan include
defaults an anticipated increase in the level of 
default              
default              
defaultbudgeted bad debt provision from 2.5% to 3.5% (c£400k increase) and 5% (c£600k 
default              
defaultincrease) thereafter. In addition, previously anticipated staffing savings of £300k in 
default              
default2015/16 and £200k in 2016/17 have been remov
defaulted from the HRA Business Plan to 
default              
defaultreflect the anticipation of increasing service pressures to support tenants and address 
default              
defaultgrowing rental arrears. In addition to this, further budgeted resources  of £331,000 per 
default              
defaultannum have also been built in for 2013/14 a
defaultnd moving forward to provide the 
default              
defaultnecessary staffing resources that are anticipated, as best can be at this point,  to be 
default              
defaultrequired to provide these additional services and manage the additional service 
default              
defaultpressures. Any increased costs or reduction in incom
defaulte for 2014/15 to 2017/18 will be 
default              
defaultbuilt into future Business Plans once increasing certainty is established over the 
default              
defaultemerging impact of the under occupancy reduction and the wider reform agenda. 
default4.5.
default 
default              
defaultHousing Benefit paid to tenants in the private rented sect
defaultor is based on Local Housing 
default              
defaultAllowance (LHA) rates. The LHA rates in Renfrewshire are higher for all property sizes 
default              
defaultthan in the social rented sector. As referred to above, it is anticipated that a counter-
default              
defaultproductive consequence of the under occupancy ru
defaultles will see some  tenants under 
default              
defaultoccupying in the social sector, electing  to move to the private sector and receive an 
default              
defaultincreased amount of housing benefit for a smaller sized property. 
default4.6.
default 
default              
defaultRenfrewshire Council also expects a number of possible impacts on 
defaulthomelessness 
default              
defaultgenerally which are anticipated to emerge as a direct result of the HB changes. These 
default              
defaultinclude pressure on the proportion of lets to homeless applicants due to an increase in 
default              
defaulttransfer requests from existing tenants in receipt of housing bene
defaultfit who are under-
default              
defaultoccupying their homes - this may in turn lead to an increase in the length of time taken 
default              
defaultto complete the local authorities duty to house those who are unintentionally homeless, 
default              
defaultand an increase in the need to provide (and fund) temporar
defaulty accommodation – it should 
default              
defaultbe noted that even those who are deemed to be intentionally homeless can require to 
default              
defaultbe provided with temporary accommodation.
default4.7.
default 
default              
defaultRenfrewshire Council has always recognised the housing circumstances of Council 
default              
defaulttenants and tenant
defaults seeking to transfer are given a proportion of available lets within 
default              
defaultthe current allocation policy. 
defaultThe Council is continuing to take a flexible approach in 
default              
defaultconsideration of mutual exchange applications to accommodate those tenants impacted 
default              
defaultby the unde
defaultr-
default              
defaultoccupancy rules.
defaultBenefit capdefault4.8.
default 
default              
defaultWhile numbers affected by the benefit cap within Renfrewshire are low (29), for the 
default              
defaultaffected larger families this poses significant concern. The annual reduction in housing 
default              
defaultbenefit paid to these households is currently estimated as £106,384. Input from DWP 
default              
defaultand other agencies, including the Council will be required to provide support to the 
default              
defaultfamilies in relation to employability and housing options.
defaultSupport and Exempt accommodefaultdationdefault4.9.
default 
default              
defaultDiscussions have commenced with the Council’s commissioned housing support 
default              
defaultproviders to look at current service specifications; current housing support provision; 
default              
defaultcurrent housing management provision to determine what changes need to be 
default              
defaultconsider
defaulted when developing new tenders for these commissioned services.  In the 
default              
defaultfuture housing support and housing management must be much more clearly aligned 
default              
defaultwithin service contracts to ensure supported accommodation projects are sustainable. 
default              
defaultWhile the DWP ha
defaults indicated that they wish to better understand the supported housing 
default              
defaultsector and the impact of housing benefit in the sector in order to protect existing 
default              
defaultprovision from the unintended consequences of welfare reform, until this work is 
default              
defaultconcluded risks re
defaultmain in relation to supported housing provision.
defaultTemporary Accommodationdefault4.10.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUnder occupancy restrictions are being placed on HB recipients placed in Council 
default              
defaultowned temporary accommodation. This is not the case where tenants are placed in 
default              
defaultprivately sourced/le
defaultased accommodation used for this purpose. In Renfrewshire 88% or 
default              
default147 out of 167 properties used to house people presenting as homeless are council 
default              
defaultowned therefore this potentially places an additional burden. The majority of 
default              
defaulthouseholds living in tempora
defaultry accommodation receive housing benefit and are placed 
default              
defaultin accommodation arising from an urgent need rather than a strict adherence to size 
default              
defaultcriteria. By the end of July 2013 arrears of approximately £27,000 of under occupancy 
default              
defaultarrears had accumulated.
default4.11.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRe
defaultnfrewshire Council recognises its duty to minimise homelessness and protect the 
default              
defaultvulnerable. In the short term, the impact of the HB reduction will in effect create a 
default              
defaultbenefit gap which is not being passed on to homeless people temporarily lodged in 
default              
defaultaccom
defaultmodation. This is a new burden and a form of cost shunting from the DWP to 
default              
defaultlocal authorities which has the direct impact of diverting already stretched Council 
default              
defaultresources away from other priority areas in order for the Council to protect the most 
default              
defaultvulnera
defaultble of clients from what is seen as an unintended consequence of welfare 
default              
defaultchanges. However, it is recognised that this action taken by the Council will not be 
default              
defaultsustainable in the long term and addressing this unintended and unfair consequence of 
default              
defaultthe refor
defaultms on the most vulnerable of individuals is something which the Council 
default              
defaultcontinues to lobby the DWP for through a range of routes.
default4.12.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn addition, it is intended that housing costs for short stay tenants will be included in 
default              
defaultUniversal Credit at LHA rates and 
defaultpaid direct to tenants. There will also be a 
default              
defaultmanagement element, or overhead, however the method to be applied has yet to be 
default              
defaultdetermined. The Council has significant concerns over the underlying logic of this 
default              
defaultapproach which is expected to place significa
defaultnt pressure on already extremely 
default              
defaultvulnerable clients and it is fully anticipated that a very high level of non payment of 
default              
defaultassociated rent will occur as a consequence. An estimated non-recovery of £482,000 in 
default              
defaultannual rental income relating to the direct pa
defaultyment of the Housing Benefit element to 
default              
defaultshort stay tenants through Universal Credit is expected to have an impact on the 
default              
defaultCouncil’s ability to provide Short Stay, temporary accommodation.
default4.13.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWork is ongoing to look at the current modelling of temporary and supported 
default              
defaultaccommodation to determine the future viability of the current model of service delivery, 
default              
defaultwhich at present proves to be highly effective at meeting the immediate needs of 
default              
defaultvulner
defaultable individuals and families. The Council is also looking at developing other 
default              
defaultoptions within the private sector to ensure single households have sustainable and 
default              
defaultaffordable temporary housing options in accommodation that is the correct size and 
default              
defaultmeets th
defaulteir needs. The Council is currently carrying out scoping exercises of empty 
default              
defaultbuildings and cost analysis on buildings that could potentially meet the Council’s 
default              
defaultrequirements moving forward. However, it is recognised that such potential re-
default              
defaultmodelling of ser
defaultvice delivery comes with the risk that what is subsequently put in place 
default              
defaultfails to deliver an equivalent level of service, impacting once again on some of the most 
default              
defaultvulnerable in our society.
defaultLHA changes default4.14.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDuring 2012/13 the Council supplemented the DHP fun
defaultd by giving a total of £168,000 
default              
defaultand over the last year Renfrewshire Council actively supported private sector tenants 
default              
defaultimpacted by the LHA changes. Tenants were contacted and invited to apply for a 
default              
defaultDiscretionary Housing Payment as a means of providing sh
defaultort term support to allow 
default              
defaultthem time to consider their options or seek alternative accommodation. Overall 
default              
default£104,000 was awarded to tenants in private rented accommodation with £26,000 of this 
default              
defaultarising from the direct contact made by council staff to tenant
defaults affected by the LHA 
default              
defaultchanges. The Council continues to support these customers however with the scale of 
default              
defaultthe changes for social sector tenants the DHP fund is expected to be under significant 
default              
defaultpressure as the year progresses therefore it is anticipated 
defaultthat there will be less scope 
default              
defaultto provide a similar level of assistance to affected tenants.
defaultChanges to non dependant deductionsdefault4.15.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Council recognises that non dependent adults living in a property are expected to 
default              
defaultmake a contribution to housing costs, ba
defaultsed on income. The increase in non dependant 
default              
defaultdeductions over the last two years places additional pressures on landlords in collecting 
default              
defaultthe balance due from non dependants and with the introduction of the under occupancy 
default              
defaultmeans that the presence of a non 
defaultdependant can lead to the need for detailed benefit 
default              
defaultadvice. Households with non dependants have been beneficiaries of DHP payments 
default              
defaultover the last year.
default5.1.
default 
default              
defaultDiscretionary Housing Payments (DHP) provide claimants with additional 
defaultfinancial 
default              
defaultassistance with housing costs, in addition to any welfare benefits, where a local 
default              
defaultauthority considers that further help is required. The DWP allocate the fund to councils 
default              
defaultand councils can, under the legislation, consider adding to this fund up
default to a maximum of 
default              
default2.5 times the DWP allocation. In short to medium term a DHP award is likely to be one 
default              
defaultof a limited number of options open to support tenants.  
default5.2.
default 
default              
defaultThe UK Government increased the overall DHP fund to help mitigate some of the short 
default              
defaultto medi
defaultum term impact of the Housing Benefit changes. The Renfrewshire allocation 
default              
defaulthas increased from £74,464 in 2012/13 to £267,351 in 2013/14. The DWP has advised 
default              
defaultthat this increased level of discretionary funding is to be targeted at mitigating the 
default              
defaultimpact of
default the under occupancy reduction, the benefit cap and the impact on temporary 
default              
defaultaccommodation after the introduction of Universal Credit. 
default5.3.
default 
default              
defaultIn the last two financial years the Council has approved additional top up DHP funding 
default              
defaultof £60,000 in each year. The UK
default Government allocations were £52,314 in 2011/12 and 
default              
default£74,464 for 2012/13. 
default5.4.
default 
default              
defaultIn addition to the DWP allocation for 2013/14 of £267,351 the Council has approved 
default              
defaultadditional top up support for the DHP fund by £150,000 (150% of previous year) from 
default              
defaultits own res
defaultources bringing the total support available to £417,351 to provide tenants

default              
defaultthat this
default will not address the loss of benefit of £1.8 million across all housing providers 
default              
defaultin relation to the under occupancy alone. There is a proposal going to the Co

defaultRenfrewshire Council would like to take the opportunity to draw the Work and Pensions 
default              
defaultCommittee’s attention to another significantly concerning aspect of the UK Governmen
defaultt 
default              
defaultwelfare changes linked to the introduction of Universal Credit – direct payments. The 
default              
defaultCouncil view this proposal as the biggest single financial risk to the long term 
default              
defaultsustainability of housing services within Renfrewshire. It breaks the existing 
default              
defaultarra
defaultngement of housing benefit support being paid direct to the landlord and places 
default              
defaultresponsibility on individual tenants to manage their overall finances and sustain on an 
default              
defaultongoing basis payment of their rent. It is the Council’s view that although many tenan
defaultts 
default              
defaultwill, with appropriate support from the Council, transition to this new arrangement, a 
default              
defaultlarge number will struggle which will inevitably lead to a significant increase in rent 
default              
defaultarrears, placing increased financial pressures on social landlords and long
defaulter term rental 
default              
defaultlevels. 
default6.2.
default 
default              
defaultEmerging findings from the DWP Demonstration projects highlights the increase in the 
default              
defaultlevel of non payment of rent and where rental income is being recovered, this is at a 
default              
defaultsignificant cost to the social landlords involved – a cos
defaultt that DWP do not at this stage 
default              
defaultappear willing to support. Given the limitations of the demonstration projects concerns 
default              
defaultremain over the long term impact of direct payment and the cost of supporting tenants 
default              
defaultto make payment and the impact on household inc
defaultomes and social landlord revenue 
default              
defaultstreams where conflicts arise. Using Council data, if 10% of tenants do not pay rent the 
default              
defaultloss of rent income per year will amount to £2.6 million a year and this loss rises to £5.2 
default              
defaultmillion if non payment rises to 20%. 
default6.3.
default 
default              
defaultProjected losses in rental income of this order will cause significant challenges in 
default              
defaultrelation to the funding of maintenance programmes and long term investment in 
default              
defaulthousing provision. The Council and social landlords in general will be required to review 
default              
defaultthe affordability of existing funding streams and consider the impact on rent levels for all 
default              
defaulttenants as a consequence of the significant financial pressures that are anticipated.

defaultResponsibility and funding for CT support transferred t
defaulto the Scottish Government and 
default              
defaultthe Council tax Reduction scheme developed in Scotland broadly mirrors the previous 
default              
defaultCouncil Tax Benefit scheme. As the scheme transferred to the Scottish Government 
default              
defaultless 10% of the funding, the Scottish Government and COSLA
default agreed to fund the 
default              
defaultdifference for 2013/14. This transitional arrangement means that recipients of the new 
default              
defaultCouncil Tax Reduction have not seen any change in the level of support they receive. 
default              
defaultDiscussions are being progressed between Scottish Ministers a
defaultnd COSLA in relation

default 
default              
defaultRenfrewshire Council has develo
defaultped and implemented a wide ranging corporate wide 
default              
defaultprogramme of work to ensure the Council is effectively mobilised and plans to manage 
default              
defaultas far as possible the impact of the welfare reform changes. 
default8.2.
default 
default              
defaultProgramme activities through 2012/13 have focused on rai
defaultsing awareness of the 
default              
defaultchanges and engaging directly with those affected, in particular with tenants. A 
default              
defaultcorporate training programme has been developed and delivered to staff and 
default              
defaultcommunications tools such as video and a range of print materials have been
default 
default              
defaultdeveloped and shared with partner organisations across Renfrewshire. The Council 
default              
defaultand partner RSLs have engaged directly with tenants with 85% (1662) of council 
default              
defaulttenants receiving direct contact prior to 1 April 2013. 
default8.3.
default 
default              
defaultTo further recognise the needs of 
defaulttenants, Renfrewshire Council has approved 
default              
defaultproposals to reclassify a property where it can be evidenced that a bedroom is stated 
default              
defaultas being required to meet disability or medical needs, and no other suitable alternative 
default              
defaultis available and amendments to the 
defaultallocations policy to enhance exchange options.
default8.4.
default 
default              
defaultIn addition to supplementing the DHP
default funding outlined at paragraph 5
default.4 the Council has 
default              
defaultapproved £1.3 million in additional resources for 2013/14 to support tenants and 
default              
defaultcitizens affected by the welfare changes, including the Housing Benefit changes. This 
default              
defaulthas resulted in the deployment of a 45 strong team across a range of services, 
default              
defaultincluding Housing Services, Advice Services and the Benefits Service to provide help 
default              
defaultand
default support.
default8.5.
default 
default              
defaultWelfare reform represents a major financial risk to the Council Housing Revenue 
default              
defaultaccount (HRA) over the medium term as a range of welfare changes take effect over 
default              
defaultthis period. The Council has planned for and responded to predicted increases in 
default              
defaultcustomer demands, needs and also to pro-actively protect the financial position of the 
default              
defaultHRA. Resources involved in rent collection have increased as part of proactive 
default              
defaultmeasures outlined earlier. Twelve temporary posts were funded by the Housing 
default              
defaultRevenue A
defaultccount at a cost of £0.080 million in 2012/13 with a full year recurring cost of 
default              
default£0.331 million moving into 2013/14 to supplement existing resources in Housing 
default              
defaultServices. The underlying objective of this investment is to both, support the tenants and 
default              
defaultthe
defaultir families manage the change but also to seek to pro-actively protect the HRA rental 
default              
defaultstream during this transition. 
default8.6.
default 
default              
defaultThe Council’s Benefit Service is proactively managing requests for review and disputes 
default              
defaultin relation to application of the under occupanc
defaulty reduction in accordance with the 
default              
defaultHousing Benefit legislation and guidance. When additional information is provided by 
default              
defaultthe customer that supports removal of the reduction, the housing benefit decision is 
default              
defaultrevised. Where the decision upheld, a submission
default is prepared and submitted to HM 
default              
defaultCourts and Tribunal Service for consideration.

defaultA welfare reform summit was held in Renfrewshire in December targeting support and 
default              
defaultawareness at Third sector organisations operating in Renfrewshire and the Council has

defaultrec
defaultently supported a Third Sector Welfare Reform event led by the Third sector

defaultAn Employability Conference was held in June 2013 targeting employability and

defaultbusiness development practitio
defaultners from across Renfrewshire. Information on Welfare

defaultRenfrewshire Council is willing to present oral evidence to the Work and Pensions

defaultCommittee
default in relation to this inquiry into the provision of support to meet housing cost in

defaultthe reformed welfare system.
default&#xa0;defaultThe Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD), the Scottish Government’s official tool for identifying those places in Scotland suffering from deprivation, published in 2012 notes that Renfrewshire’s overall share of the number of datazones showing th
defaulte worst deprivation in Scotland has increased and the single overall most deprived datazone in Scotland is located in Ferguslie, Paisley. 
defaultIn SIMD 2012, 14.7% of Renfrewshire’s population (25,030 people) is income deprived, compared to a Scotland average o
defaultf 13.4%. In terms of employment deprivation, 15% of working age Renfrewshire residents (16,070) are employment deprived, compared to 12.8% in Scotland as a whole. Between SIMD 2009 and SIMD 2012, Renfrewshire had the largest increase in the percentage of w
defaultorking age people who are employment deprived (2.4%). Renfrewshire has the 7th largest share in terms of the 15% most deprived areas in Scotland.
defaultThere are approximately 75,000 households in Renfrewshire. 34% of Renfrewshire households rent their home in t
defaulthe social rented sector. Renfrewshire Council is a social landlord and retains 12,540 council houses with 68% of the households receiving Housing Benefit to assist them with meeting their housing costs. There are also approximately 7200 social rented prope
defaultrties managed by Registered Social landlords in the Renfrewshire area, with 69% receiving Housing Benefit.
defaultThe number of households renting in the private rented sector in Renfrewshire is estimated at 8,200. Of these around 3,400 receive Housing Benefit (L
defaultHA).
default17,311 households in Renfrewshire were in receipt of Housing Benefit, totalling £63.8 Million as at 31 March 2013. Of this, £28.5 million was paid to Council tenants and £35.3 million was paid to tenants of Registered Social Landlords and private land
defaultlords.
default1,960 council tenants are affected by the under occupancy reduction. A total of 1,657 tenants under occupy by one bedroom, while 284 under occupy by two bedrooms and 19 under occupy by 3 bedrooms. The total income at risk of non payment at this time
default is £13,500 per week, or £700,000 per annum.
