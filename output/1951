[normal]Written evidence from Alan Reid
[normal] [PH 23]
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Parliament’s Ombudsman Service[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]This submission is a
[normal] separate
[normal] response 
[normal]to 
[normal]the PASC’s questions 11, 
[normal]12 and 13, 
[normal]based on my 
[normal]recent 
[normal]successful 
[normal]completion of the PHSO
[normal]’s
[normal] 
[normal]“
[normal]obstacle course
[normal]” for 
[normal]admissible 
[normal]complaints
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]11. What should be the relationship betwee[bold]n the Parliamentary and Health S[bold]ervice Ombudsman and[bold]Answer[bold]: [bold]As a body [bold]of final appeal, when a department’s complaints procedure has not given satisfaction[bold] to the citizen[bold].
[normal]Answer[bold]: The Ombudsman should cease to be an officer of Parliament[bold], [bold]should [bold]become independent, [bold]and[bold] should[bold] be [bold]financed by the departments it covers.[bold]As a creature of Parliament
[normal], the
[normal] PHSO has not b
[normal]een properly held to account
[normal] by Parliament.
[normal] 
[normal]To the citizen
[normal], PHSO accountability 
[normal]seems to consist
[normal] of producing 
[normal]a glos
[normal]sy annual
[normal] report
[normal],
[normal] and an annual 
[normal]cant
[normal]er by the Ombudsman before 
[normal]the PASC. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A citizen 
[normal]with a complaint 
[normal]can 
[normal]be made to 
[normal]feel he is 
[normal]taking on the 
[normal]Establishment
[normal] 
[normal]fronted 
[normal]by the PHSO, 
[normal]which g
[normal]ives a privileged position not only 
[normal]to the 
[normal]Department 
[normal](vis-à-vis the citizen
[normal]) but 
[normal]to 
[normal]the MP who gets the f
[normal]inal letter from the Ombudsman (on first-name terms in my case) 
[normal]wi
[normal]th 
[normal]just 
[normal]a copy 
[normal]to the citizen
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The office of Ombudsman would surely be more conv
[normal]incing to the citizen 
[normal]if the
[normal] holder was not seen as 
[normal]part of the Establishment. The current Ombudsman was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire 
[normal]‘for services to equal opportunities’ 
[normal]- after heading the Equal Opportunities Commission for eight years.  All other Ombudsmen with one exception have been ‘Sirs’.
[normal]  The PASC published a report criticising the giving of honours to people for doing their day job, 
[normal]yet it went 
[normal]along with 
[normal](presumably) 
[normal]appointing such a member of the Establishment as the current Ombudsman.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Ombudsman should 
[normal]be independent, financed by the departments
[normal] it covers. For every 
[normal]admissible complaint 
[normal]that reaches the Ombudsman, a department should 
[normal]also 
[normal]pay a fee. 
[normal]In this way, each 
[normal]select committ
[normal]ee 
[normal]can get involved
[normal] with its de
[normal]partment’s complaints procedures
[normal] and outcomes
[normal].
[normal]Answer[bold]: [bold]Continuation of [bold]the [bold]present[bold] relationship, but on a less chummy basis.[bold]Any 
[normal]kind of broader relationship between the PHSO and the PASC is difficult to envisage
[normal].  
[normal]It is 
[normal]surely 
[normal]the
[normal] PASC 
[normal]which 
[normal]has allowed the present sorry state of affairs to develop. 
[normal]T
[normal]he PASC works mainly in private, meeting only 
[normal]occasional
[normal]ly in public, 
[normal]to ‘take evidence’.  At the time of writing (mid-September 2013), the Committee has not met since publ
[normal]icly since 2 July 2013, and 
[normal]currently 
[normal]has 
[normal]no scheduled 
[normal]public 
[normal]meetings (although a hearing is 
[normal]mentioned 
[normal]for October
[normal] 2013
[normal]).  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The PASC secretariat may share the same address 
[normal]as the PHSO, but they can hardly 
[normal]take any initiative without the say-so of the
[normal]ir
[normal] MPs. 
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12. How effe[bold]ctive is the Parliamentary and H[bold]ealth Service Ombudsman as a service for handling complaints that have not been adequately dealt with elsewhere?[bold]Answer[bold]: On the [bold]basis of my experience, ‘ineffective’[bold].[bold] [bold]Yes
[normal], 
[normal]the 
[normal]MP did forward my 
[normal]complaint 
[normal]and
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]yes
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]PHSO 
[normal]did obtain an apology f
[normal]rom the UK Border Force, but 
[normal]to 
[normal]g
[normal]et the PHSO to act I had to allow myself to become 
[normal]angry with a
[normal] PHSO employee, whose one-sided questioning 
[normal]on the telephone 
[normal]was designed to mak
[normal]e me drop the case. Prior to knowing whet
[normal]her the PHSO would indeed take up 
[normal]my complaint,
[normal] and in connection with the annual hearing of the Ombudsman
[normal],
[normal] I 
[normal]submit
[normal]ted
[normal] 
[normal]evidence 
[normal]to the PASC 
[normal]on the procedural
[normal] 
[normal]‘story so fa
[normal]r’
[normal].
[normal] This was also designed to put pressure on
[normal] the 
[normal]PHSO 
[normal]to 
[normal]take up my complaint, following that telephone call.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]How should complaints about the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman be handled?[bold]Answer[bold]: B[bold]y an Independ[bold]ent Assessor, as an [bold]appeal [bold]body [bold]when a clearly laid-out[bold] internal complaints procedure has not given satisfaction.[bold]This sh
[normal]ould also obviate any 
[normal]idea of (theoretically) 
[normal]expand
[normal]ing
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]present 
[normal]role of the PASC.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]How effectiv[bold]ely does the Parliamentary and H[bold]ealth Service Ombudsman deal with [bold]complaints?[bold]Answer[bold]:[bold] On[bold] the basis of my experience[bold], [bold]unconvincingly. [bold]I did get some acknowledgments of 
[normal]procedural 
[normal]faults
[normal], but I was not convinced that ‘lessons would be learned’.  In one
[normal] case, the PHSO 
[normal]would have been better just to acknowledge that they had made a mistake, instead of giving me a cock-a
[normal]nd-
[normal]bull story about the department’s arrangements
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]13. Should citizens have direct access to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman for all complaints, as people already have in respect of complaints about the [bold]NHS?[bold]Answer: [bold]Direct[bold] access[bold] for all[bold], without having to go through an MP.[bold]As things stand, there is even a lack of precision as to whether one can go through 
[normal]any
[normal] MP, or only the constituency MP. In my case, as a complainant living outside the UK, PHSO wording implied I could only go though Mr Jenkin MP (as chairman of the PASC). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The arguments for retaining the ‘MP filter’ seem to rest on a rather idealised view of MPs’ relationships with their constituents. Most people do not know who their MP is (80 %?). People move residence between elections. Many will have never voted for their MP, given the UK electoral system, and may be disinclined to go to the ‘opposition’. Some may know another MP better, through circumstances. Then people get ‘disenfranchised’ for weeks when there are by-elections and general elections, and a new MP has to recruit staff and learn the ropes.  There must be nagging doubts about whether, or when, a certain MP will deal with a case, because of some highly-publicised activity which clearly impinges on their ‘day job’, or because the MP is an important Minister, or simply because of the many recesses when people are not sure if the MP is around. Others might wonder if the MP 
[normal]would indeed forward the case, because the complaint fortuitously goes against that MP’s known
[normal] political agenda, or sponsors
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What should [bold]be [bold]the relationship betwee[bold]n the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman and MPs [bold]and how can it work[bold]?[bold]Could the [bold]Parliamentary and Health S[bold]ervice Ombudsman do more to support MPs[bold]’[bold] handling of complaints[bold] on behalf of [bold]constituents?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Answer[bold]: [bold]This is [bold]more [bold]for[bold] the[bold] 650 MPs to answer[bold] (11 [bold]MPs [bold]are on the PASC).[bold]&#xa0;
