[normal]Written evidence submitted by Antibiotic Discovery-UK [bold](AMR[bold]0017[bold])[bold]Antibiotic Discovery-UK is a
[normal] not-for-profit 
[normal]network of leading academic researchers and universities together with SMEs all of whom have a common goal of revitalising of antibiotic discovery research in the UK.
[normal]We address the following: 
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Is there sufficient research and investment into new antibiotics or other treatments and methods to ensure continued protection against infection? If not, how could this be rectified? 
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]What global coordination and action is required to fight antimicrobial resistance and is the UK contributing e
[normal]nough towards cros
[normal]s-border initiatives?
[normal]c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Government’s 2013-2018 strategy for tackling antimicrobial resistance? What changes might be made to further strengthen the Government’s action plan
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We do not believe that there is sufficient research and investment into new antibiotics to ensure continued protection against infection.
[normal]We propose a
[normal] Cross Research Council group (MRC, BBSRC, EPSRC, NIHR) initiate a program of  fundamental and developmental research into  antibiotics for the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections.
[normal] [bold]NHS England should commission NICE to compile a report on the Limited Population Antimicrobial Drug Pathway and antibiotic unit price relating to encouraging industry into the AMR field.
[normal]The UK government should discuss with the European Commission an Antibiotic Recovery Plan along the lines of the Marshall Plan or the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise.
[normal] 
[normal]The UK government encourages EU to expand the IMI program focus on antibiotic discovery and development
[normal]. 
[normal]The UK government should encourage the formation of  a global network for antibiotic discovery and development. 
[normal]We welcome and support the Government’s five year plan. 
[normal]Its strengths are that it most importantly identifies the problems, and proposes seven key areas for future action. 
[normal]We have described above some areas which we believe could add weight to the five year plan.

[normal]Is there sufficient research and investment into new antibiotics or other treatments and methods to ensure continued protection against infection? If not, how could this be rectified?   
[normal]We propose that this could be rectified in the following ways:

[normal]Research
[normal]: 
[normal]We propose that in recognition that modern medicine cannot continue in its present form without effective antibiotics,  that a  Cross Research Council group,  consisting of the  Medical Research Council (MRC), the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(EPSRC) and the  National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) of the United Kingdom initiate a program of research with the aim of conducting fundamental and developmental research into  antibiotics for the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections. The Cross Research Council Antibiotic Research Program (CRCA) would add to existing investment by Research Councils and Charitable bodies. It would support innovation in the public sector and industry for the enhanced development of commercial antibiotics and diagnostics , which would be expected to lead to improvements in NHS care and preventative medicine. In addition it will provide new insights into bacterial infectious diseases. It will further enhance the UK’s international reputation, the home of Alexander Fleming, as a world leader in antibiotic research. Such an investment would provide a significant stimulus to the pharmaceutical sector in particular and the economy more generally.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The CRCA would link at least eight universities and centres across the UK and have strong links to industry.  The UK is home to a wide range of outstanding scientists with innovative approaches and skills which range from medical and biological to physical sciences who will combine their expertise to enable new discoveries in antibiotic research with a speed and scale not previously possible, even in industry. The concentration of funding in UK Antibiotic Research will provide a focus to enhance existing and emerging collaborations into strong nodes of activity with the pharmaceutical industry and this would attract inward investment into the UK economy. We propose that modelled on the Farr Institute (2013
[normal]),
[normal] special funding  for capital and grant  support is provided by the British 
[normal]Government for a CRCA 
[normal] 
[normal]Initiative
[normal], which crucially would provide the core infrastructure required to support this ambitious programme.  The Programme Plan will include work on basic bacteriology, antibiotic resista
[normal]nce, epidemiology, chemistry,  
[normal]drug design and clinical
[normal] evaluation. Special arrangements should be made for collaboration with industry, for international cooperation, for specialized training and for the centralized provision of reagents for research use to ensure widespread dissemination and uptake of emerging scientific results and new technologies. CRCA will closely engage with the public, ensuring that the benefits of the research are clearly visible to patients and to the public. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Specific Proposal
[normal]: 
[normal]A Cross Research Council group (MRC, BBSRC, EPSRC,
[normal] 
[normal]NIHR) initiate a program of  fundamental and developmental research into  antibiotics for the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections.

[normal]Investment: 
[normal]Industry must be encouraged to re-enter the AMR field. This needs a combination of government and regulatory initiatives. For example, the Limited Population Antimicrobial Drug Pathway (Infectious Disease Society of America) 
[normal]propose
[normal]s that the development of a new antibiotic should require small clinical trials with patients who are infected with highly resistant bacteria. This would reduce the cost of development. Marketing approval should be given on the basis of successful trial outcome. 
[normal] The use of the new antibiotic would be restricted 
[normal]to the treatment of patients with highly resistant bacteria. This should reduce the emergence of resistance to the new antibiotic.  Industry would be allowed to charge a high unit 
[normal]price for the antibiotic. This 
[normal]should en
[normal]courage industry to re-enter
[normal] antibiotic discovery and development. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Specific Proposal
[normal]: NHS England should commission NICE to compile a report on the Limited Population Antimicrobial Drug Pathway and antibiotic unit price relating to encouraging industry into the AMR field. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Public-Private investment: 
[normal]The UK government plays an important leadership role in Europe. It has been sugges
[normal]ted that 
[normal]the European Commission initiates an antibiotic recovery plan which is based on the concept of the Marshall Plan in 1948. A modern 
[normal]public private partnership 
[normal]precedent for this already exists in USA, and is calle
[normal]d
[normal] the 
[normal]Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise which contains multiple agencies which focus
[normal] on
[normal] antibiotic recovery. The Marshall Plan could be funded by loans and grants from the European Commission to the pharmaceutical industry(SMEs and large companies). It is envisaged that for the loans, collateral would be provided by the government, interest rates would be very low, but the money would have to be repaid, whereupon it would be reinvested in antibiotic recovery.
[normal] These loans should be long term and should only be repaid once the company is profitable, and even then over a long period. If a large pharmaceutical company buys the biotech, it will only gradually pay back the loan if the project which it bought reaches the market and is successfully marketed. 
[normal] This principle was successfully used by Germany in 1948, and its share of the Marshall Plan money was loaned
[normal] out
[normal] numerous tim
[normal]es over to industry for 
[normal]40 years
[normal] or more
[normal]. 
[normal]It is thought that 60% of the fund should be loans and 40% should be grants to universities, SMEs, and major pharmaceutical companies.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Specific Proposal
[normal]: the UK government should discu
[normal]ss with the European Commission
[normal] an Antibiotic Recovery Plan along the lines of the Marshall Plan or the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The largest
[normal] public-private
[normal] initiative in Europe is t
[normal]he Innovative Medicines Initiative
[normal](IMI). T
[normal]he pharmaceutical industry association (EFPIA)
[normal] and the EU share the funding of this program. We welcome this. At the moment, of the 40 projects, only a small number are aimed at antibiotic discovery and development. This small number should be increased, or a separate program should be set up which is devoted to antibiotic recovery. Because of the substantial involvement of the major pharmaceutical companies, drug development is well served. But, it can only fund existing projects,
[normal] and half the money needs to be from industry. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Specific Proposal
[normal]: the UK government encourages EU to expand the IMI program focus on antibiotic discovery and development. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]What global coordination and action is required to fight antimicrobial resistance and is the UK contributing enough towards cross-border initiatives?
[normal] 
[normal]There is a need for a global over-arching network of scientists who are engaged in antibiotic discovery and development. A possible model for this is the not-for-profit Antibiotic Discovery-UK network of leading academic researchers and universities together with SMEs all of whom have a common goal of revitalising of antibiotic discovery research in the UK. The ex
[normal]pansion of this network into a g
[normal]lobal
[normal] network would be feasible at a relatively low cost. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Specific Proposal
[normal]: UK government should encourage the formation of such a global network. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Although
[normal] there are precedents in other areas such as malaria, HIV and tuberculosis, there is no global antibiotic discovery organisation. The UK government should encourage organisations such as the 
[normal] Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation 
[normal], 
[normal]Open Source Drug Discovery
[normal], Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative, 
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] Global Fund 
[normal]and the World Bank to turn their attention to Antibiotic Recovery.
