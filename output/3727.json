"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Ann Farmer [FBB0018]&#xa0;\nAs a viewer/listener I have serious concerns about the content of some BBC output, especially drama, but also comedy, featuring \nincreasing examples of \nviolence, sexual material and bad language. The fact that some programmes make excellent viewing cannot be \nexcused as\n ‘balanc\ning\n’ the negative viewing material. \nEntertainment that can be safely enjoyed by all the family is sadly lacking, and despite some e\nxcellent programmes on CBBC, the soap operas that children want to watch with their parents, despite being broadcast before the watershed, feature violent attitudes and a negative view of the family.\nBias on BBC News and political programmes is also a prob\nlem, with the minority ‘Guardian’ view presented as majority views and the majority view presented as being held by a deranged minority; issues of concern in this respect are assisted suicide, Climate Change, the EU and Israel. Where religion is discussed,\n the level of understanding can be embarrassingly poor.  \nI\nn view of these problems I\n would like\n \nto see \nthe BBC Trust \nas\n a separate body, completely independent from the BBC; the Trust should be paid for out of the licence fee\n, and\n should include someone w\nho can adequately represent the interests and concerns of licence fee payers. The complaints process should be simplified, and there should be realistic sanctions for broadcasting transgressions. There should be proper age verification of those accessing 1\n6+ \niPlayer\n. \n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
