"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the \nCommittee on Standards in Public Life\n [PCC Progress 23]\n&#xa0;Introduction1. The Committee on Standards in Public Life is an advisory Non-Departmental Public Body (NDPB). The Committee was established in October 1994, by the then Prime Minister, with the following terms of reference:\n&#xa0;\n“To examine current concerns about standards of conduct of all holders of public office, including arrangements relating to financial and commercial activities, and make recommendations as to any changes in present arrangements which might be required to ensure the highest standards of propriety in public life\n.”\n&#xa0;\n2. The Committee on Standards in Public Life is defined by its Seven Principles of Standards in Public Life which are Selflessness, Objectivity, Integrity, Accountability, Openness, Honesty and Leadership. \n&#xa0;\n3. The Committee’s terms of reference were updated in 2013 \nto include “anyone who works as a public office-holder. This includes all those who are elected or appointed to public office, nationally and locally, and all people appointed to work in the civil service, local government, the police, courts and probation services, NDPBs, and in the health, education, social and care services.”\n \n \n&#xa0;\n4.\n \nFor some time the Committee has been interested in the debate around the application of the Seven Principles of Public Life to policing\n. \nWe made clear our intention to monitor the extent to which \nPolice and Crime Commissioners (\nPCC\n)\ns are genuinely open and accountable and how successfully any ethical risks arising from their role are addressed in our Annual Report,\n which said the Committee will keep a watching brief on “Ethical standards in the police, including Police and Crime Commissioners.” \nThe Committee has responded to the College of Policing’s draft code of ethics\n where the Committee welcomed the introduction of a code of ethics in principle and emphasised the importance of properly embedding a code of ethics into an organisation. \nAs part of our work plan, the Committee has met with Police and Crime Commissioners to discuss how it can best assist them in pre-empting any ethical risks they may face in their new roles\n, although the Committee is keeping open the\n possibility of conducting an i\nnquiry if it is warranted\n. The Committee therefore welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Home Affairs Committee call for evidence on Police and Crime Commissioners. \nThe Committee’s response focuses on two questions:\n&#xa0;\n5. Recent news stories, such as the “plebgate” incident, have contributed to the growing concern around standards in policing. R\necent surveys have found that public trust in police is declining. In a poll conducted by YouGov, the number of respondents who trust senior police officers has decreased from 72% in 2003 to 49% in 2012\n. A quarter (26%) of those surveyed by ComRes in 2013 said the “plebgate” affair has made them less likely to trust the police.\n \n&#xa0;\n6. The role of Police and Crime Commissioner was introduced last year as part of a package of measures to improve accountability and standards in policing. Individuals are elected rather than appointed but have to be as politically impartial as any other public servant. Each PCC is responsible for holding their local police force to account and is directly accountable to the voters in their locality. \nPCCs are \nalso accountable to \nPolice and Crime Panels (PCPs), who have a veto over the appointment of chief constables\n \nand the setting of the pre\ncept (with a two thirds majority). \nAs the Home Secretary recently said “the purpose of directly-elected police and crime commissioners was clear. They’d be elected, visible, well-known in their communities and accountable to the electorate.”\n In an assessment of progress, Lord Taylor of Holbeach said in a recent debate “\nDespite only being in post for a year, PCCs are already more visible than anonymous police authorities. Seven out of 10 members of the public are aware of PCCs.\n”\n \n&#xa0;\n7. The role of Police and Crime Commissioner is subject to legislation. The Policing Protocol Order 2011\n “sets out how the new policing governance arrangements will work and clarifies the role and responsibilities of police and crime commissioners.”\n The Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act \n(PRSR) \n2011\n makes provision for the administration and governance of police forces and\n includes detailed requirements \non PCCs. The Schedule to the Local Policing Bodies (Specified Information Order) 2011 (as amended in 2012) requires PCCs to publish “a statement of the policy of the elected local policing body in relation to the conduct of relevant office holders, including procedures for the handling of qualifying complaints and conduct matters.”\n There is currently an obligation for PCCs to publish information under the following headings:\n&#xa0;\n8. \nA culture of transparency should include being transparent about standards of behaviour of PCCs and their staff. \nThe C\nommittee believes that PCCs are facing\n ethical challenges in their new role\n as ethical leaders\n, particularly around\n: \n&#xa0;\n9. The PRSR Act allows \nPCCs t\no appoint a deputy PCC and \noth\ner staff as thought appropriate. \nThe Act states that \nappointment of staff of merit\n does not apply to th\ne appointment of a deputy PCC\n.  The \nPolice and Crime Panel is required to \nmake a recommendation to the PCC as to whether or not the candidate should be appointed\n after reviewing information on \nthe criteria \nthe PCC \nused to assess suitability and how those criteria were satisfied.  The PCC may choose to accept or reject the recommendation of the Panel.\n The Committee considers appointments an area of risk for PCCs as they are not bound by p\nrinciples of good practice for public appointments formulated by the Commissioner for Public Appointments\n. There have already been\n all\negations and\n perceptions of \ncronyism, lack of accountability and misuse of money that \nit has been argued could \ninstead have been spent\n on frontline policing services.\n \nTransparency is essential throughout the appointme\nnts process and as far as possible\n it should adhere to the principles and guidance set out by the Commissioner for Public Appoin\nt\nments.\n&#xa0;\n10. \nThe Committee defined integrity to mean public office holders “not placing themselves under any obligation to people or organisations that might try inappropriately to influence them in their work.”\n To satisfy this principle and avoid conflicts of interest, the Committee considers the retention of registers of interests, \ndetails of \nme\nmbership of organisations,\n \nbusiness interests and gifts and hospitality essential. The Committee agrees with the Home Affairs Committee report ‘Leadership and Standards in Police’ that said “Where hospitality is accepted, an up-to-date register should be kept by all police forces, with full details of those providing such hospitality, dates, and other relevant details. The register should at all times be in the public domain, including online, with additional entries being made immediately available.”\n \n \n&#xa0;\n11. In order to preserve high ethical standards and assure the public that decision\ns\n are being made fairly and free from influence, it is important that procurement and decision making is done in \nan \nopen and transparent way. PCCs should also consider how lobbying activities may bring about conflicts of interest in respect of procurement and decision making. As we said in our lobbying report “\nAt the heart of the concern is the confluence of money, influence and power an\nd vested interests: it is often \nnot known who is influencing decisions or what may have been done to achieve the influence.\n”\n A publicly available register of meetings held with external stakeholders could \nincrease \ntransparency and openness around these issues. As we recommended in our lobbying report “\nPublic bodies should routinely publish information about all significant meetings and hospitality involving\n \nexternal attempts to influence a public policy decision.\n”\n&#xa0;\n12\n. \nThe Committee believes the ethical risks identified above are best dealt with \nby \nthe introduction of a code of conduct which would \nprovide \nthe public with \na common unde\nrstanding of expected standards for PCCs\n. \nThe code should be based on the Seven Principles, adaptable to local needs, have clear links to any existing and new codes of conduct and be published. However,\n \nit is not only important to introduce a code of ethics but also to implement it in such as way as to embed high ethical standards into the culture of the police force and its day to day processes.  PCCs need to hold chief constables to account in this area in a meaningful and systematic way, recognising that recent evidence shows there is much to be done before the high standards in public life to which we all aspire are fully internalised in the cultures of all our public institutions.\n&#xa0;\n12. \nThe Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 and the Elected Local Policing Bodies (Spe\ncified Information) Order 2011\n \nlegally \nrequire \nPCCs\n to publish information\n such as a register of interest. A \nHome Affairs \nCommittee report entitled ‘\nPolice and Crime\n \nCommissioners:\n \nRegister of Interests\n’ \nnoted\n that\n:\n “\nA number of PCCs have so far failed to publish the required financial information, or disclose the details of their own interests and allowances. The Home Office must monitor compliance with legal responsibilities to publish information and publish a list of non-compliant PCCs.\n”\n The Committee agrees with the recommendation of the Home \nAffairs \nCommittee and notes that \ncodes and standards are only effective if they are embedded into the culture of an organisation and its everyday business. \n&#xa0;The role of Commissioners in holding their chief constables to account13\n. The Committee believes \nthat as well as fulfilling their obligations locally, it is also important for PCCs to consider their responsibilities to national policing beyond their local commitments. \nPart of this includes being held to account by the Police and Crime Panel in accordance with the requirements of a code of conduct, as well as publishing information such as registers of interest. The Committee agrees with the Home Affairs Committee who \nwrote\n in their report ‘\nPolice and Crime\n \nCommissioners:\n \nRegister of Interests\n’\n \n“\nWe do not accept that a national register of PCCs’ interests is not necessary. There was\n \nunanimous agreement among the Police and Crime Commissioners we called for evidence\n \nthat such a register would be a fair and helpful way to hold PCCs to account. If a national\n \nregister is being compiled for chief constables, it makes clear sense to do the same for their\n \nelected counterparts\n”\n. \n&#xa0;\n14\n. The Home Secretary has sa\nid the picture of PCCs holding chief c\nonstables to account was “a little mixed.”\n \n As we said in our response to the Public Administration Select Committee’s consultation on crime statistics \n“One of the main roles of a PCC is to open their police force to greater transparency.  Just as important is for PCCs to be (and be seen to be) transparent and open. PCCs have a duty to engage regularly with the public and local communities. This means striving for ‘intelligent accountability’ which may be easier to talk abou\nt than to achieve, but implies: “\nbuilding up a degree of trust over time that creates a virtuous feedback\n loop in which stakeholders can \nsee policies being influenced and changed\n as a result of their input and \nbeing open, particularly in relation to reporting problems to\n avoid a culture of blame\n.”\n \n&#xa0;\n15. \nPCCs are ultimately held accountable at the ballot box and a PCC who has lost public trust and confidence may not be re-elected. \nIndividual behaviour that falls below the standards the public expects could also affect the reputation of, and trust in, the police as a whole.  \nThe Public Attitudes Survey carried out on behalf of the Committee demonstrates that levels of trust are not static, trust can be lost and restored but it is a long and difficult process\n.\n \nAs we said “\npublic\n \nconfidence has not yet returned to its 2004\n \nlevel, let alone to the level reached in 2008,\n \nwhen only 18 per cent of the population held\n \nsystematically sceptical views about those i\nn \npublic office.\n”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Conclusion16\n. The Committee welcomes the Government’s commitment to increase accountability in policing. \nT\nhe Committee believes\n that PCCs\n should be subject to their own code of ethics based on \nthe \nSeven Principles that is applicable to their own experience. \nThey must be clear about how they themselves are accountable\n \ni\nn order to secure public confidence\n that they are fu\nlfilling their role of holding chief c\nonstables to account. \nAs highlighted in the Committee’s \n“\nStrengthening transparency around lobbying\n”\n report, increasing transparency \nleads to greater accountability\n. Openness and transparency exposes and deters malpractice, improves accountability, encourages the highest standards of integrity and promotes public trust. PCCs need to promote and sustain these principles, leading by example, \nsince\n as\n leaders of local policing bodies, they are critical to setting the culture of transparency and ethical behaviour in which the public can have trust across the criminal justice system in their area\n.\n&#xa0;\nCommittee on Standards in Public Life\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n              \n              \n \nhttp://www.public-standards.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Annual-plan-13-14.pdf\n The Committee notes the Stevens report and its recommendations\n.
