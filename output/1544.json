"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Kenneth A. G. Harris (TIC 047)\n&#xa0;Introduction.This submission is made, as chair, on behalf the Dengie Hundred Bus Users Group {DHBUG] a community group which was set up in 2010. \nThe Appendix \nattached has been included\n because our\n purpose\n and experiences are seen to mirror the central issues faced across \nother \nrural areas.\n&#xa0;\nOur Key Recommendations.\nResponse to Inquiry.In this area ECC have a table of \nMinimum Service Levels \n[MSL] \nfor\n mainstream\n commercial\n transport provision in\n \n[\nDeep\n]\n Rural Areas, based on settlement size:\nSettlements with a population of less than 100\n              \n              \nNo conventional minimum service level\nSettlements with a population between 100 and 499\n              \nA daytime service five days per week\nSettlements with a population between \n500 and 999\n              \nTwo return daytime journeys, six days\n \n              \nper week, plus one Monday to Friday\n \npeak hour timed return journey\nSettlements with a population between 1000 and 1999\n              \nFour return journeys (any time) per day, six days per week\nSettlements with a populati\non between 2000 and 4999\n              \nAn hourly service (minimum 8 return journeys between 09.00 and 17.00) six days \n              \nper week, plus at le\nast 2 return journeys on \nSundays\nSettlements with a population between 5000 and 9999\n              \nAn ho\nurly service (minimum 8 return \njourneys b\netween 09.00 and 17.00) six days \n              \nper week plus 2 return journeys after 19.00 and at least 2 return journeys on Sundays\n&#xa0;2.\n1. \nBy their very nature MSLs assessments are seen to be prejudicial to \nmeeting the\n needs of \nthese vulnerable groups \nwho are already at higher risk of isolation, less able to access health and retail services [often including Post Offices and Banks] \nand there is little, if any, evidence that the\nir\n needs influence \nthese decisions.\n&#xa0;\n2.2. \nHowever \nfeedback \nfrom\n \nsome\n resident\ns \nshows \nthat there is a ‘cultivated resilience’ based on cycling; walking; ‘cadging a lift’ and ‘friendly taxi services. The qualification is that ‘no pavements’ and ‘no street lighting\n’\n impose restrictions on times of day. It has been pointed out that it \nalso affects visitors.\n&#xa0;\n2.2. \nFor those reasons\n [2.1.]\n it is imperative that Community Transport \n[CT] \ninitiatives [e.g. encouraging very local ‘Book –A-Ride schemes] are \nprovided\n and\n that\n every opportunity is used to ensure that residents are aware of such services.\n Local Community Transport ‘not – for – profit’ operators should be encouraged to apply for Section 19 &amp; Section 22 permits. The use of concessionary fare \npasses should be exten\nded to CT in ‘off route’ localities.\n&#xa0;\n2.3. \nEarly indications are that t\nhe use of \nDemand Responsive Transport [\nDRT\n]\n facilities to link with conventional services, effectively linking small settlements to the ‘Normal Routes’ which serve the bigger villages \nin the same area\n, could be a positive step\n – i.e. judgements on Routes \nrather than location\n.\n&#xa0;\n3\n . What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome?3.1. The Challenges.\nThe main challenges are seen to be ensuring that services:\n-  Satisfy residents’ needs;\n-  Are co-ordinated, integrated, and affordable;\n-  Reduce car usage, road congestion; and\n a\ns a consequence decrease in the carbon \nfootprint.\n&#xa0;\n3.2. The County Council has focused on two primary \ngoals:• to tackle the growth in car use and consequential increase in congestion; and\n• to improve accessibility to the four key service/amenities of health, employment, education and food sho\npping for identified socially excluded groups.\nWe would prefer the wider definition:- ‘residents in rural areas, especially socially excluded groups’.\nWe also see it as essential that \nthere is a \ncommitment to use new technology to provide easily accessible\n ‘Real Time’ reliable, accurate\n travel information covering, and available in, rural areas.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.3. From our members’ feedback the personal reasons for using a car are pointedly related to \nstaged journeys \n[i.e. changes for various parts of the journey]\n   wi\nth dis-satisfaction focused on the inconveniences:\n- the journey, it’s stages / distances \nt\nimes\n and ticketing\n and, above all reliability\n; \n- the weather; \n- having to carry (heavy) items;\n- \nT\nhe walking environment\n /\n \navailability of \nsafe\n cycling routes\n to bus stops or train stations; and \n- parking facilities/costs at railway stations.\n&#xa0;\n3.\n4\n. Tackling the problems.\nFrom our review of various Government and other reports dealing with rural services it is seen as essential to:\n- Address the perceived p\nract\nical barriers to using public transport;\n              \n- \nQuestion the relative costs\n \nof using the car\n; \n              \n- Adopt a \nDoor – to- Door strategy\n based on sustainable transport and integration of services.\nSuccessful integration is seen to require direct ‘fast’ [express] routes - Rail and Road- that are reliable, \nand \nsupported by flexible demand responsive services.\n&#xa0;3.\n5\n. Marketing.\n3.\n5\n.1 Levels of interest.\nLocal feedback indicates that people plan and make\n their travel decisions based on:\n- Needs, options and experience [level of satisfaction and /or prejudice]; \n- Information available; information provided including advertising; but\n- Above all on ‘trust’ – i\n.e.\n certainty /reliability of delivery and\n easy\n access to real time information\n \n \nwhen   problems occur e.g. delays, breakdowns and re-routing through road closures / events.\n              \n&#xa0;\n3.\n5\n.2. Generally speaking we have found that the level of knowledge about services is greater for ‘\ncaptive passengers’\n i.e. \npeople with \nno practical alternative. For this group they have their \nown \nexperience\ns\n and share knowledge /enquiry points with and through fellow passengers – the value from “word of mouth”.\n&#xa0;\nThe \n‘choice passengers’\n tend not to consider the alternative to t\nhe car, or if they do, find difficulty in accessing relevant information, particularly on links and ticketing. \nTo win them over it will be necessary to design/ publish routes \nas seamless and as easy as ‘getting in the car’.\n&#xa0;\n3.\n5\n.3. A fundamental need is a\n series of coordinated, proactive advertising campaigns with clear definition of routes, links and ticketing arrangements. Part of which has to be ready access to ‘ door-to-door’ information including the ‘park &amp; ride’ options with specific attention to st\nation car parks!\n&#xa0;\n3.\n5\n.4. The other side of the ‘campaigning’ is to target the car user by presenting real evidence of the cost of using a car and for individuals recognising the time their journeys by car actually take. Other factors are the ability to ‘wo\nrk’ on the journey.\nThe downside is the effect on the local economy; Servicing and fuel sales. \nCompromise\n? Car sharing!\n&#xa0;\n3.\n5\n.5. \nTo \ndevelop\n \nthe local economy the potential for targeting / encouraging \nvisitors warrants active consideration, not only for\n the \nsocial contact from \n visiting relatives b\nut particularly ‘tourists’ for local \nattractions\n e.g. scenery and waterways, country walks/ cycle rides and wildlife/ bird sanctuaries. \n \n&#xa0;\n4. How effectively do community transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How can community transport be improved?4.1. Maldon District Community Transport [‘Viking’] is largely funded by Essex County Council in partnership with Maldon District Council. It is a registered charity and therefore pos\nsible for the Trustee Board to apply for additional grants from other funding sources. Viking runs its services \nunder\n two main headings;\n4.1.1.  Book – A - ride Scheme.\nAn annual \nmembership \nsubscription is charged.\n \nThe scheme \nprovides\n a pre-booked, chargea\nble service that collects a member from their home and takes them t\no the required destination. Used\n for such things as shopping, visiting friends, social outings, learning opportunities \nand\n to visit people in hospital. The services are carried out by\n volunteer drivers using their\n own vehicles or by wheelchair accessible minibus.\nThe charges are based on a cost per mile with a minimum charge per one-way trip when using volunteers and their vehicles. Where there is no volunteer driver available within a\n reasonable distance of the passengers ‘pick up’ community transport can subsidise each journey. Due to the higher costs of running an accessible minibus a subsidised sliding scale of charges is available on application.\nEvery journey must be booked with a\n minimum two working days’ notice and can be block booked for regular journeys - all bookings are dependent on a volunteer driver being available.\nThe Scheme is \nwholly\n dependent on volunteer drivers. \n4.1.2. Minibus hire scheme.The scheme enables any bona\n fide non-profit making\n member\n group within the district to hire a minibus. The minibuses have up to 15 passenger seats which can be configured to accommodate wheelchairs.\n \nBookings are made on a first-come first-served basis and must be made at least five \nworking days in advance.\n \nGroups using the service pay an annual subscription. The hiring of a minibus is on a unit cost per mile for the total journey. There is a minimum charge per hire.\nCurrently \n‘\nViking\n’\n ha\ns\n about \n90 fully trained MIDAS drivers. All dri\nvers are CRB checked. Some groups have their own \nregistered qualified \ndriver which allows easier planned excursions.\n&#xa0;\n4\n.2. \nImprovements looked for are:\n- Better publicity and proactive community engagement especially for \nvolunteer \ndriver recruitment;\n- \nMore decentralised location of minibuses to reduce dead mileage and improve convenience for drivers;\n- \n \nConsideration of service / operational advantages that Section \n2\n2 Permits bring;\n-  Campaign for concessionary bus passes to be used\n for CT services\n in \n‘deep rural’ / \nMSL \nareas to link with\n   \nMain\n \nroutes [Bus and Rail].\n&#xa0;\n5. To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand responsive transport services?5.1. Taxis are often not a real option due to costs. Service providers tend to be based in the ‘busier areas’ with their focus on higher numbers of customers for shorter /regular journeys. Travel vouchers for meeting part of the \njourney \ncost where a conces\nsionary fare pass is held are a possible answer to taxi fares but are seen as an ‘administrative nightmare’.\n&#xa0;\n5.2. \nIntegration of services by \nDRT links\n [commercial and subsidised]\n to bus and train \nroutes are seen to be the \neffective \nway forward.\n \n&#xa0;6. What are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated community? How can these services be made more affordable?6.1. We are in a ‘guess and fear’ stage. To date, for a lay group such as ourselves, information on the cuts, and thei\nr timing, is being released in general terms only. Attempts to get assessment from both local councils and service operators have essentially been dead batted. Everyone it seems is waiting for details. The first challenge is to provide details of subsidy b\nudget changes i.e. for both subsidised commercial services and Community Transport services. At the same time it is essential that the proposals for changes to commercial services are the subject of discussion at the same time.\n&#xa0;\n6.2. The broadly held assum\nption is that we are entering into a less [possibly non-] subsidised era. In some quarters there is a belief that, over and above the CSR, overall bus subsidies could be reduced by up to 50%. The expectation is that the impact from BSOG changes /reductions\n will be heavier in rural areas which are unlikely to be developed as \n‘\nBetter Bus Areas\n’\n. Then there are fuel price rises. \nThe fear in some quarters is that there is also the prospect that the reimbursement for concessionary fare passengers will not be ‘i\nnflation proofed’.  If this were to be true it will almost inevitably mean that there will be a freezing of, if not reduction in, mainstream bus services. \n&#xa0;\n6.3. \nThere is general, if reluctant, a\nccept\nance\n that the budget changes driven by the need to reduc\ne public expenditure will inevitably mean that funding will decline and reinforce the need for efficiency in the design/delivery of services. \nThat\n should also mean \nall\n services/budgets are reviewed to ensure they \neach\n provide the best match against social \nneeds. In turn that requires a move from ‘Post graduate mathematics’ to meaningful communication; paying less attention to \nwhat we spend, rather put the emphasis on \nhow we spend it.\n&#xa0;\n6.4. Our\n experiences\n lead us to believe that even without the budget redu\nctions the ‘Big Society’ proposals provide th\ne\n opportunity to think laterally– to focus on local transport needs and tailor facilities to match those needs in the context of both the economy and the environment. With meaningful community engagement i.e. In\nvolvement* allowing agreement on local priorities\n,\n these strategies ar\ne seen as a sound framework for \naction.\n* I.e. \nthe step \nbeyond consultation [This is what we are going to do –what do you think?]; past partic\nipation [\nthis is what we are going to do how\n can it be done?] \n&#xa0;\n6.5. Fares versus public funding.\n6.5.1. \nThe \nC\nommunity \nT\nransport sector \nneeds\n \nto be \na significant player in the market \ngiven cost advantages following from\n the \nvolunt\neer ‘work force’ \naccepting\n roles as drivers, passenger assistan\nts\n, and\n admin staff\n,\n \nessentially \ninvest\nment\n ‘in kind’ i.e. \ntheir \ntime\n and skills\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.5.2. \nIt is seen as essential in planning public transport that education\n and\n health\n authorities think about transport beyond the statutory deliverables. Local partnerships will need to include\n \nin the\nir\n deliberations \neducation planning and hospital transport\n, including moving staff and patients\n between hospitals\n. This also covers the need\n to ensure fair and equitable access to extending school provision – breakfast and after-school club events. This planning is seen to be particularly important with the reduction/withdrawal of education maintenance allowance\n and the features attached to th\ne extension of school leaving age\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.5.3. \nSignificantly the \nlargely (\n85% by mileage\n) commercially operated bus network will, by its \nvery \nnature, be\n \nsubject to commercial pressures and changes.\n \nWith any level of service reduction the impact is likely to be\n serious at this time when both customers [passengers] and contractors need usage to rise in order to maintain, let alone improve, service levels.\n Our view is that there is an urgent need for voluntary and community sector groups working in partnership wi\nth the local contractors, to design and provide more rational, integrated and relevant facilities. However, without access to facts it is impossible to even start pulling together a meaningful business plan. \n&#xa0;\n6.6. Policies.\n6.6.1. A basic rule of Manageme\nnt is that “\nPlans should be Strategy led and Resource disciplined\n” and therein lies a [the] major challenge. Both Essex County Council and Maldon District Council have published detailed Strategic Plans in the past but both expired in 2011 and have yet to \nbe updated / replaced. Whilst the content gave a clear view of what was looked for, the steps to achieve them were not always clear. The reality check for plans made by all levels of Government is that although budgets have been set, the spending will be s\nubject to political choice – possibly well illustrated by current debate over HS2. \n&#xa0;\n6.6.2. Again in Management terms it is not only necessary to decide \nWhat it is you want to happen but decide \nHow to make it happen. This presents a further challenge \nwhen\n \ndeciding authority / accountability. All too often the bureaucracy gets in the way to delay action/ delivery and increase costs – should it really take over two years to put in place a bus stop to reduce risk of injury to people alighting from a bus? It ha\ns in Burnham! \n&#xa0;\n6.7. Looking Forward.\n6.7.1. Central Government has given a clear lead with the Strategies ‘\nMaking transport more accessible to all’\n and \n‘\nDoor to door’\n , \nrecommending\n activity concentrating on 4 core areas:\n&#xa0;\n6.8. “Liaison is the Key”6.8.1. Provided the ‘Localism’ [\nsee para 6.4.]\n approach is adopted then we have \nevery reason to think that the challenges can be met through active community engagement. This will require ‘\nPartnership Working’\n with the \n‘Policy People’\n debating the practicalities of delivery with \n‘Operational Managers’\n as part of their planning process\n and involve service managers and staff in setting standards and measuring them.\nECC already work closely with bus service users, as ’critical friends’, and service providers to improve transport services –that will need to be the platform for making best \nuse of available resources. \n&#xa0;\n6.9. Options.\n6.9.1. Commercial bus operators have several options, they can: \n- \nRaise fares - \nin rural areas such as ours it is felt that current competitive pressures are insufficient to \n   establish\n a meaningful ‘best value’ test; \n- \nReduce service levels – local experience is that it is all too easy to simply cut out part of the route \n   effectively to choo\nse the most rewarding locations;\n- Tactical reductions in service frequency, operating hours \nor days can create savings for operators.\n&#xa0;\n6.9.2. Overall our expectation is that low utilisation bus services will be cut and the number of subsidised routes reduced.\n We see it as essential that priority is given to the needs of most vulnerable groups wh\nere service reductions are proposed and the expectation would be that ECC would find a contractor\n \nto provide supported journeys\n – in doing so there is the opportunity to adopt DRT links to main services\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n6.9.\n3\n. Railway Companies’ fares are inflation rela\nted so the issues for rail travel are somewhat different i.e. tend to be geared to/aligned with customer demand. If a \nrail \ncompany were to hit financial problems they could hand back the franchise and the Government would \nbe likely to \nstep in to ensure \ncontinuity of the service before re-letting the franchise with much the same\n \nservice specification as before [e.g. East Coast mainline].\n&#xa0;\n6.\n9.\n4\n.\n A probable consequence of LA budget cuts [including Community Transport funding] will be that\n Publicly Supporte\nd Bus services\n \nare removed, reduced, or the network altered.\n&#xa0;\n6.\n9.\n5\n. To avoid some ‘no \ncommercial \nservice’ situation\ns\n, customer expectation of fares may well need to change. So that affordable fares can be offered, the emphasis will need to be on \nencouraging more paying customers [“greater passenger contribution”] and that will require more convenient services i.e. fit for purpose.\n&#xa0;\n6.\n9.\n6\n.\n County Councils \nneed to \nplan on the basis of:\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEncouraging/incentivising the Community Transport sector including\n obtain\ning more\n Section 22 Bus Permits [No\ns\n. of applications have been rising];\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThrough Community engagement encourage more volunteers and Group memberships;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUsing the authority’s central role/leverage to bring private services to passengers more cheaply e.g. \ndiscounted taxi services; or, supporting the infrastructure for car share schemes, etc.\n&#xa0;\n6.\n9.\n7\n.\n \nReview \nConcessionary fares\n.\n a] This has been a live issue since our Group was formed and as a consequence opinions have been canvassed. The original concern, a\nnd campaign goal was for the ‘early start time’ [i.e. 9 AM rather than the strategy guide of 9.30]. The local case for the adjustment is based on the infrequency of service and to avoid unfairness where people further along the route could use the bus whil\nst others were ’departure time excluded’.\nFeedback at members’ meetings to the question –“would you be prepared to pay a reduced fare [as distinct to free passage]?” brings a strong response; “yes – provided it was a good service”. The general finding is t\nhat the potential to travel countrywide is not jealously guarded. The discussions are almost always centred on the convenience of the service rather than the cost.\n&#xa0;\nb] \nFor people currently using buses to travel to work there is concern that fares will increase or services will be lost as the number of pensioners increases [the progressive increase in retirement age is largely being overlooked]. This is not only because n\national concessionary funding does not increase in line with the network coverage, but also from the strong suggestions that the payments to contractors for concessionary fares are to be frozen or reduced and rural services will therefore be the first to s\nuffer. \nNeedless to say if there is no service, the pass is meaningless, already the case in some localities in this area.\n&#xa0;\nAnd finally our bottom line:It is our Group members’ firm belief that there is a need for a thorough review of services on the basis of integrating passenger transport – using DRT services to feed ‘express routes’ [analogy between rail infrastructure and bus routing] and including ‘Park and Ride’ facilities using railway station car parks.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Appendix&#xa0;Dengie Hundred Bus Users Group.Background: What We Do.The Group was originally set up\n,\n \nin 2010, \nto combat the withdrawal of service through a local village [Althorne]. However that exercise coincided with the consultation review of concessionary fares \nwhich\n led to more members and a wi\nder review. It soon became apparent that the problems being encountered in Althorne are also the experience across the whole of the Dengie and in all probability will be representative of problems in other rural areas. It is for that reason that we feel it\n is appropriate to make this submission and share ideas on\n  “what needs to be done”\n.\n&#xa0;\nDHBUG’s Purpose is to:\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRepresent the interests of bus users in the Dengie Peninsula;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAct as a focal point between bus users, bus service providers and local authorities; \nand\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCampaign on behalf of bus users \nfor continued and improved bus services and travel facilities in the Dengie Hundred area as part of an overall public transport system that:\nWe see it as essential to develop strategies that:\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRecognise that ‘accessibility’ needs to be measured and addressed on a \n‘whole journey’ basis;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nE\nnsure that the focus at all levels of government is on facilitating the \nintegration of public transport i.e.  Commercial bus/trains with and between other servic\nes such as school buses, hospital/community transport – with increased use of ‘tailored’ Demand Responsive Transport [DRT] as a means of sustaining / improving passenger take up across all public transport services; and\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nActively encourage and support publi\nc engagement in both Strategic and Operational Management Plans\n.\nParticipation.A number of the Committee /members have been involved in an Essex County Council Task and Finish Group involved in the design and introduction the Dengie\n Dart 99 a ‘Dial and Ride’ service from the Dengie to Hospitals and preparing the ground for renewal of local contracts for supported services.  As a result of which some now include DRT elements. Several of our members also serve as Parish Council Transpo\nrt Representatives.\nOur Area: The Dengie.The Dengie Peninsula is part of the Maldon District in ‘Central Essex’. The peninsula covers an area of about 140 square miles. It is surrounded by water; to the east by the North Sea; to the north by the River Bla\nckwater; to the south by the River Crouch. There are no bridges across the estuaries, the lowest crossing points on Maldon [Blackwater] and Battlesbridge [Crouch]. The three main centres of population are Burnham on Crouch, Southminster, and Mayland. The p\neninsula has two of the least densely occupied electoral wards in Essex – Tillingham and St Lawrence.\nThe ‘Pensioner Population’ is projected to continue to grow. Against an overall population growth of 5% between 2010 and 2015 the prediction is that the ‘\nover 65s’ will increase by 23% and account for 22% of the population: whilst the ‘over 80s’ will show a 17% increase to about 5% of the total. Feedback shows that generally as they get older people look to drive less, but with infrequent ‘unreliable’ \npubli\nc transport \nservices find they still need to drive themselves even \nthough \nthey feel unhappy about doing so!\n&#xa0;\nFor the District as a whole it is reported that 93% of the 25,000 households have at least one car and 15% of these have two or more [3348 househol\nds]. When a car is used for work the remainder of the house\nhold\n will often be dependent on other means of transport. 69% of economically active residents use \na car\n to travel to work, either as drivers or passengers. 9% use public transport [7% train; 2% bu\ns]. 13% cycle or walk. About half the workforce travel out of the district by train or bus and 78% \nof those \nby car\n for at least part of the journey\n. These figures illustrate dependence\n of people\n in the area on private transport\n and the potential for change\n.\nWith migration into the district and increased housing as a result of the \nL\nocal \nD\nevelopment \nP\nlan the probability is that the number of commuters will increase. Extra traffic and increased congestion is anticipated on the already inadequate road infrastru\ncture because of these \nand related \ndevelopments\n e.g. freight; \nwind farm\n construction.\n \n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
