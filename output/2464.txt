&#xa0;Written evidence from the Sadlers House Management Company (SLC 026)&#xa0;BACKGROUND&#xa0;In September, 2012, my wife and I returned to live Enfield, where we both born. In deciding where to live, we investigated many locations, and homed in on the Bush Hill Park area where with the somewhat rural environment and the Conservation Area status our search was narrowed to the Wellington Road/Village Road area.We viewed a number of properties and eventually decided on an apartment in Sadlers House, Wellington Road and were happy to acquire it and moved in from our old home in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire.Whilst we are both drivers, another of the added advantages was the quiet nature of Wellington Road and the availability of the “Freedom Pass” which enable to use freely Bus, Tube and Rail services.However, having moved into Wellington Road one of the disadvantages we soon noticed was the considerable scale of kerbside parking by commercial vehicles belonging to two local companies, “Par Gas” and “Liberty Gas” whose offices are located near Bush Hill Station and commuter parking.Having made enquiries, I learnt that, despite action to seek a cessation of the parking, since the commercial vehicles were taxed, it was not possible to remove them.In January this year, we noticed an increase in vehicular traffic along Wellington Road and discovered that the Rail Track level crossing had been closed since the roads on the eastern side of Lincoln Road were affected by contactors operating to replace gas mains. It was thought, apparently, that the volume of  traffic using the crossing would lead to highway problems, hence the closure.According the official notice at the level crossing displayed in January, the closure was temporary.Earlier, this year, the Borough Council employed consultants to produce a scheme for the introduction of new parking measures.It is understood that the demand for a scheme resulted from a petition by 33 local residents claiming that commuter parking, parking by the Gas Companies and the passage of buses along the road caused danger to highway safety.Discussions about the scheme with the Council’s Highways Officer  myself and other neighbours, led to an understanding that, following the closure of the level crossing, traffic counting devices had been placed in Wellington Road and surrounding roads to measure traffic flows and when the crossing was re-opened, further measurements could be taken to demonstrate the importance, or otherwise, of the level crossing.Whilst the new parking arrangements have not been announced, the general tenor on the proposals is to introduce restrictions to prevent commuter parking and generalised parking during the hours 0f 1pm - 2pm. The overall intention has been, it is understood, to make the passage of vehicles through Wellington Road more safe.In July of this year, I was elected Chairman and Secretary of the Sadlers House Management Committee and my fellow property owners have agreed that this representation is on their behalf &#xa0;APPRAISAL OF THE BENEFITS OF LINCOLN ROAD LEVEL CROSSING&#xa0;From the time I have lived in Wellington Road, my appreciation of the traffic movements in this area is that north bound traffic on London Road destined to link with the A10 - Great Cambridge Road used the Lincoln Road level crossing greatly. Such use would lead to the avoidance of vehicles travelling through the Enfield Town Centre to link with Southbury Road and then eastwards to the A.10.With the closure of the level crossing, I believe that the Town Centre traffic movement, is much greater that before the closure, so much so that traffic tail backs often occur far along London Road. Other potential conflict are evident by reason of the difficulty of traffic emerging from Lincoln Road and Village Road in attempts to join the north bound tailback in London Road.The level crossing closure now means that traffic movement along Wellington Road has grown with drivers using the road to link with Park Avenue, First Avenue, Trinity Avenue to the A10 Great Cambridge Road. Other movements through Wellington Road to the A10 are via Park Avenue, First Avenue, St Marks Road, Main Avenue to Lincoln road.The attitude of Network Rail, has led to a whole series of “Rat Runs” occurring, very often through roads with a high level of kerbside parking, leading to greater traffic danger.After the closure, it is not uncommon to see Heavy Goods Vehicles, very often of Continental origin, becoming stranded on either side of the crossing in Lincoln Road due to SatNav directions. The considerable reversing movements to re-direct these vehicles does little to aid the free flow of traffic in the area.&#xa0;ACTIONS BY RAILWAY AUTHORITY&#xa0;To the onlooker, it is difficult to understand what has led Rail Track to its decision to take an action to prejudice many thousands of motorist. The recent tragedies where deaths have occurred at level crossings could be a reason.However, since it is still possible for pedestrians to use the gate to cross the line, the opportunity for those tragedies to occur still remains and the closure for motorised traffic is, therefore,  of no consequence in that respect.My recollection of the opening and closing of the gates is that this was done, manually, by an employee of the Rail Authority who also appeared to be employed in the nearby signal box.The cynical conclusion one must draw is that the closure is related to staff employment and in this day and age of economies, Rail Track perhaps see “a saving” by the cessation of a service which has been operational for many, many years by reducing the role of the gate operator.&#xa0;SUMMARYRail Track is an unelected Organisation. It’s decision making motivesseem far distant from the decision making objectives of the Borough Council who are elected and, hopefully, represent the views of it’s electorate and it is the Borough Council who continue to object to the closure. It would also seem that Rail Track have reneged on any agreement between themselves and the Borough Council and if that is the case, the democratic process of government is badly damaged. Its actions nullify any survey results which were to be achieved by the traffic counts in local roads and leads to the costs of the survey carried out to be wasted.It is difficult also to understand why Rail Track can close a Public Highway without recourse to the Highways Acts wherein greater public representation can occur.It is also ironic that the actions of the Borough Council to seek improvements of traffic safety could been seen as a waste of money if the unsustainable traffic flows increase through surrounding roads because of the unwarranted decision by Rail Track &#xa0;CONCLUSIONSIt was seem that there are three options&#xa0; 1 Before any final decisions are made, if it is still the will of Rail Track to pursue its unwarranted action, then that process shall only be agreed following considerations under the Highways Act to close Lincoln Road to vehicular traffic, following a major public consultation process.2 That Rail Track accede to the views of Enfield Council and many thousands of local people by re-opening the crossing in accordance with the process and hours as it previously operated.3. Rail Track provide a mechanised gate system which closes the road to pedestrian and vehicular traffic at the approach of a train(s). If, as part of its cost cutting proposals, Rail Track cannot agree to such a measure, then Option 2 should prevail.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
