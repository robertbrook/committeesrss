default&#xa0;defaultSummarydefault&#xa0;defaultWe believe that all public sector reform should be guided by a set of principles
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default1. To what extent is the Government’s public service reform programmedefaultsucceeding in:default&#xa0;defaultLocality and NAVCA welcome the government’s commitment to Localism and to recognizing the fundamental role that citizens and local communities play in developing their own solutions. However, there are some contradictory actions across Government; the new Community Rights and ‘Our Place’ (previously known as Community Budgets) provide opportunities for local communities. Whereas aggregated contracts such as the Work Programme have further disempowered citizens and local communities with damaging consequences.
default&#xa0;
default Where public service reform has focused on local people and their communities, enabling community-led solutions to be developed, there has been clear evidence of improvement. The Our Place pilots have shown early evidence of gains. For example, two Locality members in East London are leading an initiative to recruit local people to become volunteer health trainers. Starting with a community door-knocking exercise, which contacted over 1,000 residents, Poplar Harca and the Bromley by Bow Centre have developed a programme which will save the NHS an estimated £4m over five years by promoting healthy lifestyles and improving treatment of those at risk of diabetes. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhere reform has not taken a community approach and instead has moved 
defaultto
default 
defaultprime/sub models or larger contracts in general, it has reduced the involvement of citizens and people who use services in their design and delivery. In some programmes, the task of commissioning itself is being contracted out. This increases the gulf between citizens, users of services, local VCSE providers and commissioners. 
defaultNAVCA and Locality welcome the potential of the Public Services (Social Value) Act to both empower citizens and improve public services. We believe it is essential that wider policy objectives are achieved through public service commissioning and procurement in order to achieve best value. Too often, best value is assessed for individual contracts and departments, 
defaultwithout looking at the wider picture and where savings or costs are accrued in different departments or services. 
defaultc. Ensuring that public services are accountable to the peopledefaultwho use them, and to elected officials? default&#xa0;
defaultThere has been a lack of transparency throughout some programmes. I
defaultn the previous commissioning round of the Work Programme, providers outlined minimum service standards in their bids that they were expected to adhere to. However, we have heard that the comprehensiveness and quality of these standards differed widely. The setting of such standards should not be at the discretion of private business and should always include quality provision for the hardest-to-help groups. Following this, service users and elected officials should have access to reporting data to confirm its accuracy. Private sector providers should not be able to hide behind a veil of ‘corporate confidentiality’.
defaultThere should be more defined channels for people who use services and for providers down the supply chain to feed information directly to commissioners, and ‘gagging’ clauses that inhibit, or perceive to inhibit, feedback should not be in place.
defaultThe feedback and views of service users should be taken into account alongside formal targets, and can often bring to light unacceptable practice that is not obvious in results tables.
default&#xa0;
default2. What evidence is there that citizen-centred approaches to publicdefaultservice design, delivery and choice of provider can deliver betterdefaultoutcomes—ensuring not only better value for money, but alsodefaultgreater social, economic and environmental value?default&#xa0;
defaultAn example of where increased involvement at the planning stages and different models of provision can lead to better value is highlighted in the following partnership involving a NAVCA member:
default&#xa0;
defaultWarwickshire Community and Voluntary Action (W-CAVA) and the Heart of England Community Foundation created Warwickshire Community Recycling (WRC)
default as a joint charitable enterprise. In a subsequent joint venture with Warwickshire County Council, WRC took over the management of two recycling centres and has developed re-use shops.
default&#xa0;
defaultThrough a small capital investment and small pump-prime loan by the County Council, the venture broke even within six months. 
defaultThe joint venture has succeeded in generating large council savings improved service provision and vastly improved recycling rates. Surplus is distributed to local community organisations.
default&#xa0;default3. What are the risks and opportunities of opening up public services todefaultalternative forms of ownership, provision and accountability?default&#xa0;defaultIt is essential that systems are put in place to ensure the most marginalized are listened to and involved. Structures should not be developed that allow new models of provision to be dominated by the best resourced most powerful and confident citizens and communities.
default&#xa0;
defaulta. How do we ensure open access to public services underdefaultalternative forms of ownership, provision and control?default&#xa0;defaultThe Work Programme has clearly demonstrated that contract design and management tools such as Payment by Results are ineffective in ensuring that people who need access to public services actually get the support they need and the state would want to be provided. The only way to really ensure open access is by enshrining a core set of principles at the heart of future reform as outline in our introduction. 
default&#xa0;default5. How successful have the Government’s reforms been in opening updefaultpublic services to grassroots community groups, rather than to largedefaultprivate or third sector organisations?default&#xa0;
defaultNAVCA believe it is inappropriate for many grassroots community organisations to take on the risks associated with delivering contracts, due to their organisational structure and size. We believe a false rhetoric that grant funding cannot be accountable or achieve best value has spread, resulting in many contracting authorities moving from grant funding to the competitive tendering of services without taking into account the specifics of each situation. 
default&#xa0;defaultIn many public service areas we are still seeing the increasing trend towards the aggregation of contracts, which is precluding more and more VCSEs from bidding. 
defaultOver the summer Locality ran a survey on the VCS’ experience of Public Sector Contracting. Systemic barriers to contract delivery 
defaultwere:
default&#xa0;
defaultWhile we welcome efforts to cut red tape and bureaucracy, it is essential that this is accompanied by efforts to promote a cultural change in commissioning. An example is the recent proposal to introduce standard PQQs across public sector contracting. NAVCA has recently supported a member whose local authority outsourced financial assessment of PQQs. The credit agency conducting the appraisal uses a system that penalizes not for profits for the very fact that they are not for profit. A standard PQQ would not change this practice, proportionality and relevance is required.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is also important that any reforms are examined to assess if they will actually support micro businesses and local VCSE organisations, as we feel the category ‘SME’ is too large and the proposed changes would disproportionately benefit the largest organisations in this category. This is not simply a matter of ensuring that smaller organisations are able to compete – it’s a 
defaultmatter of ensuring that the public purse cannot be held to ransom by a dominant group of providers who are too large to fail. See Locality’s response to the Department for Work and Pension’s Commissioning Strategy 2013. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOur members have provided us with a number of examples of local voluntary and community sector organisations failing to win subcontracts, and therefore having to operate on reduced income, but subsequently having clients for these programmes referred to them for ‘free’ services. 
defaultIt is unacceptable for private sector organisations to be receiving contracts and payments to work with clients who are then referred on to ‘free’ services.
default&#xa0;
defaulta. How can public service contracts be designed to enable servicedefaultusers to choose from a wider range of providers, includingdefaultcommunity-based providers, to achieve self-defined outcomes?default&#xa0;defaultFrom member research, Locality and NAVCA propose a number of key principles for public service commissioning as outlined in the introduction, namely:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultb. What impact has the Community Right to Bid, Community Rightdefaultto Challenge, and Community Right to Build had on localdefaultcommunities?defaultLocality and partners launched the
default 
defaultMy Community Rights service
default 
defaultin May 2012.
default We provide guidance information and free one-to-one expert advice on all the Community Rights. 
defaultThe volume of enquires has been consistently high and it is clear there is a real appetite and interest in the Rights. Total enquiries received and dealt with since the beginning of the programme currently stands at 7,957 (September 2013). 
defaultThe Right to Build
default In Locality’s experience the relationship between the Right to Build and neighbourhood planning is an important one and should be utilized where possible, to ensure the maximum benefit for local communities by ensuring that site-specific Right to Build Orders are implemented for community benefit. See the
default 
defaultsite assessment plans for Arundel
default 
defaultand Ferring for instances of affordable dwelling proposals using the Right.
defaultThe 
defaultRight to Bid
default has gained rapid momentum. We are aware of over 770 nominations and just over 550 assets of community value listings across England, and their breadth is testament to the range of asset-based community interest across the country. The My Community Rights website gives examples of a whole range of communities who have used the Right http://mycommunityrights.org.uk/case-studies/
defaultThe
default 
defaultRight to Challenge
default 
defaulthas been slower to develop, in part this is due to the the use of the Right as a negotiating tactic by Community and Voluntary Organisations. It should also be noted that as there are no central or public records kept of Challenges issued
default, 
defaultthere are real difficulties in finding out the number that have actually taking place. In a recent survey, Locality followed up recipients of Right to Challenge advice, to track their progress. We found:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default7. What examples are there of innovative ways to deliver better publicdefaultservices in local government, from other countries or from otherdefaultpublic service providers?default&#xa0;
defaultThere have been some interested service redesign work by a number of Local Authorities, including Stoke On Trent City Council and
default Bromsgrove &amp; Redditch Councils
default, which incorporate the principles we feel should be fundamental to all service delivery i.e. is citizen- focused and is shaped by the underlying purpose of the service rather than a narrow set of prescribed outcomes, helps people to help themselves and is locally based. There work has shown the dramatic improvements in delivery and reductions in costs, with a significant drop in demand
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default8. How realistic is it that “choice” can be exercised in public servicedefaultprovision or should we be looking instead at greater control by usersdefaultso they can ensure that public services become more responsive todefaultchanging needs?default&#xa0;defaultWhile NAVCA and Locality believes there is a role for choice in public services and that there are significant potential benefits for citizens from increased choice in individual services, meaningful choice is not synonymous with competition and market-based approaches, yet the general direction of the Government’s public sector reform programme heavily focuses on competition and alternative providers. We have reservations about the importance placed upon competition above other considerations, such as effective, high quality services, collaboration, service integration and shared decision making.
default&#xa0;
defaultExperience indicates that opening up public services to greater competition can have unintended consequences for quality, accessibility, equality, accountability and integrated 
defaultprovision. We would caution against simply applying pure market principles to all public services, because as the Office of Fair Trading
default found:
default&#xa0;
default“Public service markets are different. They are typically subject to market failures, such as externalities or information asymmetries. Policy makers frequently have wider policy goals alongside pure efficiency, such as a desire for equitable outcomes. As a result, the usual market assumptions do not apply. Consumers do not generally pay directly for services they receive. And providers are not generally driven by a profit motive, but by wider public service interests”
default&#xa0;defaultNAVCA and Locality believes far too much emphasis is placed on competition at the procurement stage, with not enough emphasis on involvement of citizens and users in the design and delivery of services. 
default&#xa0;
defaulta. How do we make sure that all citizens are able to influencedefaultpublic services?default&#xa0;defaultGovernment references to the voluntary sector in relation to public service delivery have centred on their role as providers of services. More emphasis needs to be given to the sector’s distinctive role; having purpose not profit as a mission and acting as advocates and representatives of those who use their services. Many voluntary sector organisations naturally embrace principles of co-production and seek to work with marginalised individuals and communities. It is therefore essential that they are not viewed just as ‘providers’, but that they are more involved in the planning and design of public services.
default&#xa0;
default“They did not hold any talks with us (as the sitting contractor) arguing that it would be improper to do so.  All we wanted to do was to tell them where they could make more savings and gain for clients - but we were prevented from doing so.”
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default9. What safeguards should be in place to deal with service providersdefaultwho fail to deliver services, or who deliver services of an insufficientdefaultquality?default&#xa0;defaultA focus on the principles outlined in our introduction would act as a fundamental safeguard in the event of failure to performe.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition during the tendering process, more emphasis should be placed on previous poor performance and poor quality. The current requirement, usually to provide 3 references, does not cover this sufficiently, as larger providers are likely to have delivered hundreds of contracts and can cherry pick the best references. References from previous grant funding should also be taken into account to support VCSE organisations move into delivering contracts.
default&#xa0;
default10.How do we ensure that best practice is shared so it can be replicateddefaultin the context of greater diversity of provision?default&#xa0;defaultLocality’s experience of capturing and sharing successful innovation is that the very best examples are developed by responding to local demand and local circumstances (our “local by default” principle). Simply replicating and parachuting in ready-made delivery models does not work. There is real scope for the sharing of ideas, encouraging peer support and learning in order to equip local providers to move forward with local solutions.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhile we welcome the training and sharing of best practice provided through the Commissioning Academy, thought should be given to how this is shared wider and to enable providers to challenge their local commissioners when practice falls short.
default&#xa0;default11.How well has the system of Payment by Results worked in thedefaultdelivery of public services and how do we make it work better?default&#xa0;defaultThe balance of PbR in the Work Programme, as has been widely reported, was badly designed and has had a number of unintended consequences.
default 
defaultIt 
defaulthas served to reduce the number and diversity of suppliers of employability services in England.  Many potential (and formerly successful) providers have disbanded their employability operations. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe lack of control that DWP currently has over the supply chain and in particular the terms offered to sub-contractors means that simply increasing higher payments for certain client groups will not automatically transfer down supply chains and ensure that the hardest to help receive the support they require. Any PbR system need to balance the payment terms to spread payment across the period clients are supported and use
