The NUT \nhas \nset out \nits case in its \nevidence to \nthe \nEducation Committee Inquiry into ‘School Partnerships and Cooperation\n. \nA summary of the record of the challenge by the DfE Evaluation Report’s lead author is also available on the NUT website.\n&#xa0;\nLondon Challenge was not only\n highly successful; it was also, unlike the academies programme, extremely cost effective. O\nver three years the funding for City Challenge was £160 million, considerably cheaper than the £8.5 billion reportedly spent on the academies programme over two yea\nrs.\n&#xa0;\nIgnoring cost-effective school improvement options and promoting costly and contentious one\ns\n should not be countenanced by Ministers at a time when budgets are under pressure.\n&#xa0;FREE SCHOOLS&#xa0;The NUT believes that the process for approving and \nestablishing free schools lacks transparency, ignores the evidence on the need for new school places locally and fails to take account of the impact of free schools on neighbouring schools.\n&#xa0;\nThe NUT’s \nevidence to support this view are set out \nits recently \npublished document, ’Free Schools, Free for All’\n which is available \non the NUT’s website.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\nDfE ‘Sponsored Academies Funding: Guidance for Sponsors’  \nwww.gov.uk/government/publications/sponsored-academies-funding-guidance-for-sponsors\n [Accessed 16 December 2013].\n The NUT’s evidence on free schools is set out in full in its recent publication, ‘Free Schools, Free for All?’ published September 2013. \nSee \nwww.teachers.org.uk/files/free-schools-16pp-a4-8963_0.pdf\n [Accessed 16 December 2013].\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n See wave 1 impact assessments at \nwww.gov.uk/government/publications/free-schools-that-opened-in-2011\nAnd wave 2 impact assessments at: \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-schools-that-opened-in-2012\n - [both  sites accessed 16 December 2013].\n \nSee report in \nGuardian\n, 04.11.13\n at: \nwww.theguardian.com/education/2013/nov/04/education-department-school-deregulation\n and the statement by the school’s governors and managers at: \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/14UvVe_qtZQd48Coo508UW-ZUhxLgEFA9ghyX567hcLg/edit?pli=1\n[both links accessed 16 December 2013].\n&#xa0;\n \nWarwick Mansell, Education in Brief, The Guardian, \n22.07.13\n \nhttp://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/jul/22/pgce-school-direct-bath-childcare\n [Accessed 16 December 2013]\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nUnion’s concerns over education advisers’ potential conflicts of interest,  BBC new website, \nwww.bbc.co.uk/news/education-2075665\n [Accessed 16 December 2013] \n See Local School Network report at \n \nhttp://www.localschoolsnetwork.org.uk/2013/11/private-eye-queries-conflict-of-interest-in-ofsted-inspections-\nanswer-came-there-none/\n [Accessed 16 December 2013]. \n \nhttp://www.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report/provider/ELS/119400\n Repor\nted in the Guardian, 25.03.13\n \nhttp://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/mar/25/ofsted-conerns-academies-undermine-improvement\n \n‘County Chief Tells Gove to Halt ‘Academy Broker’ Visits’, \nBBC News\n Website, \n23\n April 2013, \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-22271467\n [Accessed 16 January 2013]. \n \n‘\nRoke Primary School placed\n in special measures by Ofsted amid teacher exodus ahead of Harris Academy conversion’, \nCroydon Guardian,\n 7 June 2013, \n \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-22271467\n [Accessed 16 January 2013]. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhy is attainment higher in London than elsewhere?
