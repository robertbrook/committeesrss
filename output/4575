[normal]‘Local authorities should embrace a new role in e
[normal]ducation, not as providers of schools or school improvement services, but as champions for children.  This would mean articulating a local and aspirational vision for education.  As champions for children, the local authority would capture local knowledge 
[normal]and intelligence by undertaking some scrutiny of education provision to ensure that it is meeting the needs and interests of young people in the area.’
