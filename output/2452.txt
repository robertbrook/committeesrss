[[[Introduction ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1              Gentoo welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Work and Pensions Committee inquiry into support for housing costs in the reformed welfare system. Gentoo Group comprises a range of companies including three registered providers, construction, development and manufacturing companies and is based in Sunderland. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]Our response will first of all make a general statement on welfare reform and will then address the Inquiry’s specific questions in turn.

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.2              Summary of Key Points&#xa0;The principle of reducing the welfare cost and getting people into work is laudable, however welfare reform is adversely affecting many of the most vulnerable in society without there being a viable work or income alternative in place.&#xa0;Many people affected by the under occupancy charge cannot move or if they do so it will be likely to be both disruptive for them and costly to the tax payer.&#xa0;Many landlords are putting a huge resource effort into assisting those affected by welfare changes. This is generating additional hidden costs however outwith the DWP projected savings.&#xa0;The direct payment element of universal credit is likely to cause major additional hardship and a spike in household debt for vulnerable people. The direct payment element of housing benefit should therefore be urgently reviewed.

[[[General Comments]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1              Welfare Reform is a major issue for customers, landlords and wider society and we recognised this soon after the coalition Government came to power. Fundamentally it is difficult to argue against the tenet that it is not good for large sections of society to be wholly dependent on benefit. More than a quarter of all Government spending now goes on welfare which again cannot be a sustainable position. Equally however, for welfare reform to function effectively it needs the viable alternative to welfare of a vibrant and functioning economy into which formerly workless and benefit dependent households can enter. We have a fundamental problem therefore with the pace and impact of welfare reform in that punitive financial measures will be applied to a large section of society without a viable work alternative being in place. In the context of this inquiry, there will therefore be a fundamental impact on claimants in terms of putting at risk some of the most vulnerable people in society. We would therefore urge the Government to re-think the timing and severity of welfare reform until such time as the economy is in a better state to accommodate it. In addition to impacts on households there will also be impacts on landlords as they seek to deliver their objectives within an environment of increased service requirement versus increased income collection risk and this will be developed further as a theme in this response.  &#xa0;2.2              Having made these points however, Gentoo is continuing to address this issue in a robust and focussed manner in order to minimise the impacts both to tenants and to the Group’s income streams. We will continue to prepare for future implementation of Universal Credit on the assumption that the intended changes and associated  timescales will go ahead as planned. Our response will cover many of the measures that we are putting in place to deal with these changes.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[ Implications of the changes for tenants/]]]              3.1              Within Gentoo we spent a considerable amount of time and effort from the first soundings of welfare reform to assess the implications for both tenants and the landlord functions of the Group. Initial research by the University of Cambridge commissioned by ourselves and a consortium of registered providers under the banner of the Housing Futures Network (including Gentoo, Riverside, Affinity Sutton and Places for People) in early 2012 came up with a number of initial findings:&#xa0;&#xa0;(for a full copy of the report see attached link: 

[[[www.cchpr.landecon.cam.ac.uk/projects/detail.asp?ProjectID=197]]]

[[[)]]]&#xa0;3.2              In addition to the above findings, further research within Gentoo in early 2013 revealed the following amongst our own tenants - 4,384 of which  would be affected by the under occupancy charge:&#xa0;1,043 – (24%) would consider a move, 1,880 – (43%) identified a household member with a disability  789 – (18%) were identified by an officer as having a potential vulnerability.&#xa0;As well as the under occupancy charge, the Gentoo internal research into welfare reform identified impacts around the non dependent charge, benefit cap, universal credit (in particular direct payments), service charges and council tax. In addition to modelling the internal impacts of these changes wider research conducted by the local authority identified that by 2014/15 there would be a reduction in benefits across the City of £54 million with associated impacts on households already at the lower end of the income scale.  &#xa0;3.3              Faced with this mounting challenge, Gentoo therefore embarked on a programme of interventions to try and address the potential impacts of the welfare reform changes. These are summarised as follows.&#xa0;&#xa0;3.4              So far we have seen an increase in the uptake of under occupancy moves with 81 tenants having moved as priority direct allocations and a further 89 tenants having mutually exchanged  for under occupancy reasons over the 4 month period April to July 2013. Whilst these figures are not yet at a level whereby large numbers of people are moving, this is nevertheless, increasing. In addition, we do not have sufficient properties coming available to allow a significant number of additional moves to take place. This is therefore likely to add pressure on the allocations system as requests for under occupancy related moves inevitably increase.  &#xa0;3.5              Arrears have also started to increase and the latest summary figures are that we have 1,940 customers who are under occupying and in arrears.&#xa0; Of the 1,940 customers; 900 were already in arrears pre under occupancy changes so effectively 1,000 have gone into arrears since the changes were implemented.&#xa0; 1,653 have increased their arrears (by £179,569) and 287 have reduced (by £44,299). The Group therefore has had an increase in arrears due to bedroom tax of £135,270. Whilst significant, this has not been a spike increase and is more of an emerging trend.  Anecdotal evidence from front line staff is indicating that this is due to increasing financial pressure on tenants which includes rising fuel, food and council tax contributions as well as welfare changes. We are seriously concerned that as the winter approaches and fuel costs rise further, coupled with the financial pressure of Christmas, many tenants will face severe hardship and vulnerability to debt in the coming months.&#xa0;3.6              From an organisational perspective, we are taking a view that welfare reform is a high strategic priority and services have therefore been adjusted to prioritise welfare reform impacts before implementation rather than as a response to it. We have also entered into discussion and briefings with local judges to inform them of the likely impacts of welfare reform and the potential for an increase in court cases due to arrears recovery. We are offering significantly more support and adopting an early intervention role in terms of offering welfare and debt advice with a view to minimising court action due to arrears.&#xa0;3.7              In summary, in terms of our approach to tenants, we feel we are implementing a wide range of interventions and service changes designed to counter the housing impacts of welfare reform as they currently stand. We do have further concerns however over the implementation of direct payments within Universal Credit and these will be dealt with in paragraph 5.

[[[The implications of the changes to landlords]]]&#xa0;4.1              Within the initial assessment and modelling of welfare reform changes and the implications for landlords, a number of worst case scenario tests were explored within the Group. These covered the following areas of potential risk and financial exposures:&#xa0;

[[[Category]]]

[[[Worst case exposure £   ]]]Non dependent deductions40,000Benefits cap85,000Under occupancy charges2,900,000Universal credit direct payments*3,744,000Transaction costs247,000Service charges117,000

[[[Total]]]

[[[7,133,000]]]* assuming 88% rent collection worst case demonstration project scenario –http://www.dwp.gov.uk/docs/direct-payment-demo-figures.pdf&#xa0;4.2              Within these tests it became clear that there were material risk exposures around the under occupancy charge (if none of the reduction in benefit were subsequently met by tenants) and Universal Credit direct payments (working on the basis of the worst performing direct payment pilot which at the time of modelling was 88% - most recent worst performance is 91%). So far the rent collection rates around under occupancy have not materialised to any where near this level. We believe this is primarily due to a significant change in systems and processes for income management coupled with internal re-alignment of resource to address under occupancy charge impacts. &#xa0;4.3              Of far greater concern will be the direct payment of housing costs through Universal Credit. This will have a far more widespread impact – we estimate around 9,400 households within Gentoo - and is difficult to predict in terms of impact. We accept the principle of switchback if an arrears level is triggered. This could still allow 2-3 months of arrears to accrue however before a direct payment is stopped and even then it may only be a temporary switchback.  The reality of increased cost exposure is that landlords will have to re-adjust business plans to accommodate income loss. We accept that it is up to the landlord as to how those costs will be allocated, however it is inevitable that some impact on development programme will be felt in terms of available resource for cross subsidy, particularly when further hidden costs are factored in. e.g. costs of void repair and turnaround, increased court costs and allocation costs, increased aids and adaptation costs. We are also further aware that even with the mitigation systems we have put in place (discussed in paragraph 3.3) we may need to allocate more resource again to address the issues of direct payment and income management.&#xa0;4.4              As a landlord we have also looked at the further impacts of under occupancy and in particular impacts on tenants and landlords together with a critique of the overall under occupancy model and how it has been designed. In a separate piece of research, we are currently assessing the likely level of savings (to Government) generated by the under-occupation penalty, working with 3 other social landlords -  Affinity Sutton, Gentoo and Wigan and Leigh Housing - with support from the Centre for Housing Policy (University of York). This research is indicating that the proposed savings by DWP may have been significantly over stated by between a quarter and a third. Our study further confirms the DWP’s own assessment that “uncertainty about likely claimant and landlord responses to the introduction of the social sector size criteria [which] creates uncertainty about the benefit saving likely to be realised” (DWP 2012 p13). The overstating of the savings levels must therefore also be countered by the actual impacts on landlords both of which combine to further undermine the assumptions of the under occupancy model. &#xa0;4.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;              This research also compliments work being undertaken by the National Housing Federation, considering indirect costs, the likes of which are stated in paragraph 4.3 which should be taken into account in an overall assessment of the financial impact of the policy. These include potential extra net costs including:&#xa0;&#xa0;4.6                            We accept that research is still underway to accurately quantify these additional costs. However, we believe that the whole premise of the under occupancy case for achieving £930 million over 2 years should now be subjected to renewed scrutiny purely on cost saving grounds let alone the wider poverty and vulnerability aspects of this policy.  &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[atment of housing costs within housing benefit]]]&#xa0;5.1              Despite many tenants in previous research stating that they would prefer the option to have the housing element of universal credit paid direct to landlords – ( see Inside Housing research summary  http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/tenancies/most-tenants-want-housing-benefit-paid-direct-to-landlord/6517756.article) there is a still a direction of travel towards payment of the Universal Credit including the housing element direct to tenants. This may not seem significant to those policy makers who think that the transition from weekly or fortnightly payments to a monthly payment will be smooth. We have serious concerns that the initial transfer to arrears payments will cause a debt spike that many people will find impossible to retrieve. We are not yet convinced that adequate transitionary mechanisms are in place to deal with this and the early experience of discretionary housing payment administration does not convince us that a debt spike can be avoided.  &#xa0;              Furthermore, we have serious concerns this may lead to reliance on pay day lenders which is bad enough, but may well lead to reliance on illegal money lenders which can lead to horrendous circumstances for already vulnerable people, not of all of whom will be captured within DWP vulnerability assessments. If there is any leeway to further make this point in an advance of the national roll out of Universal Credit we will continue to stress it. This could have serious personal consequences for vulnerable people and can and should be avoided.&#xa0;              Finally, within the latest report of the demonstration projects released in May 2013, levels of payments by tenants have varied from 91% to 97% with an average collection rate of 94%. (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228925/direct-payment-demo-figures-may-2013.pdf)              Contrast this with Gentoo collection rates of over 99% and this would represent a significant income risk to the Group. Whilst this would only affect around a third of our tenants it nevertheless would be a material risk to our operations. &#xa0;              For these reasons we would therefore urge DWP to re-consider the direct payment element of housing costs within Universal Credit or at worst give tenants the options to switch to landlord payments if they choose to do so.&#xa0;&#xa0;
