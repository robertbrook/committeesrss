"Written evidence submitted by UKspace (ESA007)&#xa0;\nUKspace is the trade association of the UK space industry, with a mission to promote the best commercial, political and public environment for the UK space industry. UKspace is sponsored jointly by ADS and Intellect encapsulating both the upstream and downstream nature of the space sector.\n&#xa0;0.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK has a \ndynamic \nspace industry that has been \ninfluenced \nby successive UK Gover\nnments. Britain’s investment in E\nuropean Space Agency (\nESA\n)\n programmes is a \nkey driver in\n this success story \nand continued UK involvement will \ncontinue to support\n \nthe \nsector’s \nexport and growth ambitions\n.\n&#xa0;\n0.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nformation\n of the UK Space Agency \n(UKSA) \nhas helped to drive a more ambitious\n,\n growth\n-oriented\n space policy, yet more needs to be done to strengthen the \nA\ngency and focus its resources and skills to \nmaximise economic opportunities\n, including exploiting EU budgets\n.\n&#xa0;\n0.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIndustry welcomes the arrival of the EU into space policy and, in particular, into operational \ninfrastructure\n. \nEU space spend, \nat\n around €2bn per year, \nrepresents\n one of the biggest overseas market opportunities for UK industry, and should be prioritised and resourced by both UKSA and the Catapult accordingly\n.\n&#xa0;\n0.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMuch progress has been made in recent years to maximise UK value from (and influence in) ESA, through strategic investment in ESA operational programmes and in developing the ESA Harwell facility.  However, \ncontinued and growing \nsuccess in Europe requires a \nsignificantly\n larger \nUK \nnational space programme, as \nin \nFrance and Germany.  Industry welcomes the refinancing of the National Space Technology Programme in November 2012, but calls for a step change in funding, supported by a visionary and ambitious National Space Policy, and more aggregated procurement across Whitehall, in Earth Observation and secure satellite communications\n services\n.\n&#xa0;\n0.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIndustry urges the EU to avoid imposing modifications on the successful ESA model which has delivered the high level of technical competence and outstanding reputation Europe has built up since 1964. Industry believes that there are and should remain distinct roles for the EU and ESA.\n&#xa0;\n0.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nESA is \nmember\nship driven\n,\n \nand not Treaty driven. As such, there exist ample opportunities for \nthe UK Government\n,\n \nas a leading ESA member state, to \nshape \nits\n \na\ngenda\n.  In particular, \nindustry welcomes the development of ESA’s Harwell facility and its remit\n focussed on the\n growth prospects of interest to UK industry. \nHowever\n,\n the UK \nc\nould play a more assertive role in ESA itself, for example in pushing for UK \nD\nirectors\n at ESA\n, an issue acknowledged by the Science minister in a recent parliamentary debate.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK’s thriving space sector contributes £9.1 billion a year to the UK economy and directly employs 28,900\n,\n with an average annual growth rate of almost 7.5%\n over the last decade\n. This \nstrength\n has been shaped over time by support from successive UK Governments and \nin particular through \nthe\n UK\n’s \ninvolvement in ESA\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nESA has played a crucial role in building a competitive and innovative space industry in Europe. ESA’s procurement principles ensure that investment by Member States helps to shape ESA programmes and they ensure that this investment is channelled back proportionately into national priority areas. \nJ\nuste\n retour\n has provided a reliable \n–\n and\n \naccountable \n–\n mechanism\n \nfor guaranteeing return on investment by ESA member states.\n UKspace wants to see these principles retained. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the UK has won a greater share of EU space research grants and infrastructure and service contracts thus far than it has invested by virtue of its membership of the EU, suggesting that the UK fares well out of both ESA’s and the EU’s procurement processes\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt the 2012 ESA Ministerial Council, the UK Government announced investment of £1.2bn into some of Europe’s most significant space projects through the UK Space Agency, a 25% increase in UK investment in ESA. Through leverage effects this should enable £1 billion of private investment into the UK space sector; and help the industry achieve the ambitious goals of growing to a £40 billion industry by 2030 and generating an extra 100,000 jobs.\n&#xa0;\n1.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nESA has changed considerably over the last decade\n.\n ESA has developed world-class skills and competences that must be retained and utilised.\n \nIt has\n broadened its horizons from a s\ncientific R&amp;D organisation into one that also ha\ns a strong focus on supporting i\nndustr\nial R&amp;D\n. \nFor example,\n through its ARTES \nt\nelecommunications \np\nrogrammes\n,\n it is helping \ni\nndu\ns\ntry \ndevelop/retain\n world-leading expertise and service offerings to the large, and growing commercial market\n. It has also \nbegun to create \nthe \ns\npace \ni\nnfrastructure for \nn\navigation and \ne\narth \no\nbservation that will allow \ni\nndustry to exploit these growing downstream services markets.\n&#xa0;\n1.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nESA and specifically \nthe \nE\nuropean Space Operations Centre in Germany (E\nSOC\n),\n has helped the UK d\nevelop European leadership in satellite ground segment and o\nperations at a low cost to the UK \n(\nas \nthe \nreturn is partially allocated to Germany\n)\n.\n \nThe flexibility of the Optional Programmes has allowed the UK to develop leading technologies in the more commercial Space sectors.\n&#xa0;\n1.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nESA has a long history of managing complex high\n \ntechnology\n-\nri\nsk programmes. In most cases these have been successful and delivered on time and \nto \nbudget. \nHowever, \nthe Galileo procurement processes of both the European Commission and ESA proved susceptible to \np\nolitical \nintervention, leading to cost overruns and delays, underlining the \nneed for\n strong UK political engagement in \nboth\n organisations\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe welcome the arrival of the EU into space policy. Space is increasingly vital for delivering public policy at local, regional, national and supra-national levels, and has a key role in reaching Lisbon Treaty objectives of a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy by creating high-skilled jobs, commercial opportunities, boosting innovation and improving citizens’ well-being and security. For example, Copernicus (formerly GMES) is a vital tool for the EU in environmental protection.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUKspace\n recognises the five areas of concern raised by the Commission and \nin particular acknowledges \nthe need for closer cooperation in order to avoid duplication and to maximise public benefits. \nWe believe that\n ESA and the EU can work well together, with distinct and complementary roles, with ESA as the design\n and implementation\n authority and the Commission as the policy maker helping to \ndefine public user requirements and \nstimulat\ning\n \nand funding the operation and \nexploitation of space infrastructure\n for the benefit of\n European econom\nies\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe EU interest in space is recent and rapidly evolving. The EU\n and the UK \npublic sector \nface the same challenge\n, \nto \nbecome a smart customer and \ninformed \nuser of satellite-enabled services, in areas from precision agriculture to cleaner air, from smarter, safer transport systems to satellite broadband.\n&#xa0;\n2.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGiven ESA\n’\ns success, industry shares the UK Government\n’s concern about any \noverly hasty move to bring ESA under the wing of the EU, and supports the Government\n’\ns cautious approach to moving the two institutions closer together.\n \nTo align the need for coordination with the importance of maintaining distinct roles, t\nhe \nCommission’s proposal\n for ESA to set up a specific ESA directorate in charge of implementing EU programmes, under EU rules, should be evaluated.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nIndustry \nstrongly support\ns\n an EU role as space p\nolicy lead and sponsor for downstream services dedicated to socio-economic applications.\n Industry would like to see this EU role, promoting space exploitation, \nbetter\n reflected \nand co-ordinated \nin Horizon 2020.\n&#xa0;\n2.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nCommission\n pointed to\n \na ‘democratic deficit’ in ESA’s accountability. Industry believes ESA offers good \naccountability\n to \nESA \nmember states, including the ability to target investment against national interests\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe level of influence that the UK has in ESA is already strong. \nUK scrutiny could be enhanced further by an annual \nP\narliamentary debate on space policy\n, as the Committee recommended in its 1999/2000 inquiry\n, and as the shadow science minister \nadvocated \nin a recent debate\n.\n The UK \nshould be more assertive in its efforts to secure UK nationals in senior positions in ESA, especially among its Directors\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOverall UK advocacy in EU space areas remains under-resourced and under-structured, partly reflecting the fast evolving nature of the EU’s space landscape.  Industry is currently reviewing its own representation, as a major strand of the \non-going\n Space Innovation and Growth Strategy, and we encourage UKSA to review and strengthen its own resourcing in\n relation \nto EU space matters\n, including, for instance, \npromotion of\n more UK nationals in the EU’s growing space policy community\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nR&amp;D is \nan important enabler \nof economic growth\n and underpins the competitiveness of the space industry\n.  \nThe innovation component of the EU’s next seven-year budget is\n an opportunity to \nbuild\n a platform for growth \nand competitiveness\n. Asia, for example, currently reinvests 3.5% of total GDP in R&amp;\nD\n, whilst Europe commits just 2%. Placing Horizo\nn 2020\n at the centre of Europe's \neconomic plans \nwould send a very clear message that the EU and its \nM\nember \nS\ntates are committed to fostering innovation and \neconomic \ngrowth\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe long-term nature of R&amp;D cycles in the space sector means that stable funding is especially important for businesses. EU funding should focus on the very early stages of technology development in order to mitigate the risks for companies, universities and individuals investing in experimental technology and in \noperationalising\n new satellite-enabled service capabilities.\n&#xa0;\n3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe space sector uses a NASA-based Technology Readiness Level scheme to mark the progress of on\n-\ngoing research and development. These range from “Basic Technology Research‟ (TRL1) through to demonstrated, ready-for-market systems (TRL9). As a general principle, research and innovation funding should target projects between TRL1 \nand\n TRL6, \nwhich for the space sector should extend up to and include in-orbit demonstration\n and service demonstration for downstream applications\n. This is where public assistanc\ne is most valuable to industry.\n&#xa0;\n3.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Commission has promised a “strengthened steering, monitoring \nand evaluation” of Horizon 2020, with \nprogress tracked through a set of indicators every two years. \nWe recognise\n the need to ensure coherent implementation across the programme, especially of SME participation and international co-operation, but some of the particular reporting required can necessitate substantial expenditure \non \nauditors. \nWhilst recognising that expenditure of public money must be properly scrutinised, some of this expenditure could be reduced through simplification of the reimbursement mechanisms and \nput to better use in the resear\nch programmes being undertaken.\n&#xa0;\n3.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA specific weakness of the EC’s FP7 research programme has been lack of funding for satellite communications and satellite navigation applications.\n&#xa0;\n DG ENT\nR\n’s space research programme largely ignores telecommunications, despite the contribution of satellite communications to growth and public policy, \ne.g.\n in the EU Digital Agenda targets for 2020 for deployment of high-speed broadband to all European citizens. \n&#xa0;\nFunding for developing satellite navigation applications has also been lacking in recent years, despite the progress made on the launch of the \nGalileo\n satellites\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIt is essential that these \nomissions \nare \ncorrected\n in Horizon 2020\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUKspace strongly welcomed the formation of the UK Space Agency and commends the Coalition Government for upholding and advancing the space policy it inherited.\n \nThe UK now has an executive space agency with \nits own\n space budget\n, rather than the pooled budget of its predecessor\n. In addition, we welcome:\n&#xa0;\n4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUKSA has been significantly under-resourced, affecting its relationships with industry, and degrading the perceived transparency of its decision-making.  Examples are in dealing with EC communications and in producing the promised National Space Policy.   \n&#xa0;\n4.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDespite the UK’s policy leadership in promoting a growth agenda in space, the UK is now almost unique amongst spacefaring nations in lacking a resident, full-time economic or analytical capacity, a capacity which could sit within the agency or the Catapult. \n&#xa0;\n4.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIndustry believes that there are a number of improvements that could be made by UKSA\n. Many of these recommendations are emerging through the current \nwork on \nthe Space Innovation and Growth Strategy, due for publication in the second half of this year. Emerging issues include the need for UKSA to\n:\n&#xa0;\n4.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe failure of the UK to achieve any director in ESA, compared with three each for France, Italy and Germany, is a failure of ambition and influence by UKSA.\n&#xa0;\n4.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUKSA must work closely with industry to ensure that together they are delivering on growth. The current work on the IGS is vital to reach the target 10% share of the global market by 2030.   Growth is driven by the downstream services market so we must target key sectors for growth and work with the other Catapults to fully exploit these markets. UKSA can help unlock barriers to market access and help take science and technology into the marketplace.\n&#xa0;\n4.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEffective ESA \nand EC \nengagement requires complementary national funding to create the conditions in which industry can win greater share\ns\n of ESA ‘noble work’\n and EU funding\n. This approach is well recognised and practised by our \ninter\nnational competitors. Industry therefore welcomes the establishment of the National Space Technology Programme (a key recommendation of the first Space IGS in 2010) and its refinancing in the Autumn Statement of 2012. However, industry considers a stronger NSTP an essential test of UKSA’s commitment to help maximise UK economic return from EU and ESA space spend\n. This is also key to\n risk reduction of new commercial initiatives which can then attract City funding.\n  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK has \ndeveloped world leadership in both space science and in commercial export markets, part\nly from \ntargeted investment in ESA programmes with proven \nscientific and \neconomic \npotential, notably ARTES.  However, \na better balance between national and ESA investment is essential if the UK is to fully exploit its ESA (and EU) investments.\n&#xa0;\n5.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nESA is a vital wealth creation mechanism for the UK space-enabled economy, providing an excellent means for UK\n-\nbased operators to leverage off leading edge UK technologies\n,\n \nenabling \nUK exports of high value \nsatellite systems and services\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nJuste\n retour\n allows for targeted investment by \nM\nember \nS\ntates. \nThis was r\neflected at the 2012 ESA Ministerial, with the UK \ndeciding to \ntarget investment into key optional programmes\n based on the\n economic or science benefits.  Industry welcomes the growth focus of the policy agenda which has shaped the successful ESA Ministerial outcome. Industry pointed to prospects for a 6:1 return on targeted investment at C-M\nIN\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInvestment at the ESA Ministerial has triggered the announcement by ESA that it will bolster its UK presence by transferring its Telecoms and Integrated Applications Directorate to Harwell. \n&#xa0;\nIndustry strongly welcomes the moves to strengthen the UK voice in ESA. The satellite communications business is Britain's biggest commercial space success story, supporting over 70% of the industry’s manufacturing workforce. \n&#xa0;\nThe ESA decision reinforces Britain’s credentials as the best place in Europe to do the business of space.\n&#xa0;\n5.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEarly decisions on investment in ESA programmes helps create a more strategic and long-term UK agenda in ESA; it helps industry plan ahead, develop technology roadmaps and identify export opportunities. It is vital that the UK invest strongly in the early phases of major programmes, in order to get sufficient control to deliver UK technology priorities and maximise growth opportunities.\n&#xa0;\n5.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n UKspace has demonstrated that there are strong\n commercial spinoff benefits from \nearth observation, \nspace science\n \nand robotic exploration \nin terms of\n&#xa0;\ntechnologies\n,\n and also in terms of software and services to the global Space market.\n&#xa0;\n5.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK has demonstrated that it achieves a better return on investment than other ESA Member States. This is primarily through its highly developed capacity to take ESA developed technology to the commercial market. It is also strongly influenced by the UK selection of ESA optional programmes that are better aligned to the global marketplace. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;6.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernment understanding of \nthe resilience of the UK’s space-based infrastructure \nis hampered by the absence of a \nclear definition of who owns it, what risks have been considered or the efficacy of mitigation measures.\n&#xa0;\n6.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere \nshould be a\n clear UK owner or overseer of resilience plans for the satellites and ground-based supporting infrastructures that provide critical UK \ncapabilities\n and\n \na\n comprehensive analysis of space systems critical to the UK\n. This should \ninclude \nan analysis of\n the level of resilience of space-related capabilities or of mitigation measures in the event of disruption.\n&#xa0;\n6.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCPNI has decided that \ns\npace is not part of their scope primarily because of the lack of a Lead Government Department\n for space security\n.\n&#xa0;\n The EC require\ns\n the UK to treat the UK Security Monitoring Centre for the Galileo programme as critical national infrastructure.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\n6.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is no resilience apparent in the provision of satellite communications to Government Departments such as the Foreign Office or the Department for International Development and no analysis of whether these links should be resilient and if so, to what degree.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\n6.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe threats from natural events in space are well understood\n and ESA has an on-going programme to provide monitoring and \nwarnings of Space Weather events\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe loss of space assets has a similar impact whether from natural events or deliberate actions.\n&#xa0;\n The focus must be on things we can control\n –\n \nimpact \nmitigation within the national infrastructure.
