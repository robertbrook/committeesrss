defaultIs cycling safe, yes largely, but the perception is no.

defaultThe perception 
defaultas always 
defaultis a little more complicated, some mornings while commuting I 
defaultthink yes it is safe, but when
default you have a bad experience 
defaultand if you cycle for any length of time
default you’ll have a few
default, 
defaultit quickly becomes a no. When you
default are 
defaulto
defaultn
default a bike you are a lot weaker than a car or truck, so when you have that bad experience it’s a

default unfair contest the cyclist always l
defaultoses. 
defaultCyclist are
default weaker, slower and more exposed.

defaultI have been cycling for a number of years now so am quite used to the road conditions, 
defaultI 
defaultrecently had a terrifying experience, 
defaultroad
default rage driver wanted me out the way, narrow road. I went to the police to 
defaultreport this. Complete waste of time, the police said they would not even consider looking into this, no

defaultWhat should be done
default4.1) Safe infrastructur
defaulte, the Highway code, item 63 states use the cycle lane “ they can make your journey safer” so how is it a lot/mos
defaultt
default of cycle lanes are designed to offer no safety benefit at all. As I stated above the cyclist is the one who will lose, it really does not mat
defaultter 
defaultwho’s
default fault it the 
defaultcyclist who
default suffers. 
default4.2)
default 
defaultMixing HGV’s and cyc
defaultlist 
defaultis
default down
defaultright silly. HGV’s are designed to be used on motorways and have too many blind spots for use in amongst city traffic, it unfair on the driver and bike.  
defaultSimply a stupid idea
default.
default4.3) The Police need to take safety seriously, is it a funding issue or a cultural issue?  As cyclist could benefit from training the police should be educated into the challenges and faults in the system cyclist are exposed to. From my experience I will
default never waste my time reporting dangerous driving again. Which I know this is not helping, but it’s a waste of time. Every time the police come out with few day long operations and fiddle around the edges ignoring the Elephant in the room the real safety is
defaultsues they lose credibility, yes the situation is complex 
defaultbut  challenge
default they face.
default5.)
default              
defaultIt’s easy to play the blame game, drivers should do this, cyclist that, helmets, ear phone, car radios, tinted window, 
defaultetc, 
defaultnone of which is going to resolve the fundame
defaultntal issue, which is cyclist are weaker 
defaultand need space and the law need to been seen to work, not as one off and not one sided.
