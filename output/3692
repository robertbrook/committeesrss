[normal]Thank you for the opportunity to contribute, its greatly appreciated.
[normal]1.)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Is cycling safe, yes largely, but the perception is no.  
[normal]2.)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The perception 
[normal]as always 
[normal]is a little more complicated, some mornings while commuting I 
[normal]think yes it is safe, but when
[normal] you have a bad experience 
[normal]and if you cycle for any length of time
[normal] you’ll have a few
[normal], 
[normal]it quickly becomes a no. When you
[normal] are 
[normal]o
[normal]n
[normal] a bike you are a lot weaker than a car or truck, so when you have that bad experience it’s a
[normal]n
[normal] unfair contest the cyclist always l
[normal]oses. 
[normal]Cyclist are
[normal] weaker, slower and more exposed. 
[normal]3.)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I have been cycling for a number of years now so am quite used to the road conditions, 
[normal]I 
[normal]recently had a terrifying experience, 
[normal]road
[normal] rage driver wanted me out the way, narrow road. I went to the police to 
[normal]report this. Complete waste of time, the police said they would not even consider looking into this, no
[normal]t
[normal] 
[normal]interest
[normal]ed
[normal] .
[normal] So what do I do, get back on the road knowing there is nothing not even the law protecting me?
[normal]4.)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]What should be done
[normal]4.1) Safe infrastructur
[normal]e, the Highway code, item 63 states use the cycle lane “ they can make your journey safer” so how is it a lot/mos
[normal]t
[normal] of cycle lanes are designed to offer no safety benefit at all. As I stated above the cyclist is the one who will lose, it really does not mat
[normal]ter 
[normal]who’s
[normal] fault it the 
[normal]cyclist who
[normal] suffers. 
[normal]4.2)
[normal] 
[normal]Mixing HGV’s and cyc
[normal]list 
[normal]is
[normal] down
[normal]right silly. HGV’s are designed to be used on motorways and have too many blind spots for use in amongst city traffic, it unfair on the driver and bike.  
[normal]Simply a stupid idea
[normal].
[normal]4.3) The Police need to take safety seriously, is it a funding issue or a cultural issue?  As cyclist could benefit from training the police should be educated into the challenges and faults in the system cyclist are exposed to. From my experience I will
[normal] never waste my time reporting dangerous driving again. Which I know this is not helping, but it’s a waste of time. Every time the police come out with few day long operations and fiddle around the edges ignoring the Elephant in the room the real safety is
[normal]sues they lose credibility, yes the situation is complex 
[normal]but  challenge
[normal] they face.
[normal]5.)
[normal]              
[normal]It’s easy to play the blame game, drivers should do this, cyclist that, helmets, ear phone, car radios, tinted window, 
[normal]etc, 
[normal]none of which is going to resolve the fundame
[normal]ntal issue, which is cyclist are weaker 
[normal]and need space and the law need to been seen to work, not as one off and not one sided.
