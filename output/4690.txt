[[[Financial incentives to encourage conversion to academy status]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;

[[[Undue pressure / intimidation of school leaders and governing bodies to convert]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;The process of converting to an academy has placed a high demand on the energies of governors, the head teacher and other senior leaders and it has distracted them from focusing on improving the quality of teaching and learning.&#xa0;The same point is made more powerfully still in the report on Leyland Methodist Junior School in March 2013 &#xa0;Another significant barrier to improvement has been the amount of time the headteacher has been involved in the discussions about transferring to an academy. Given the headteacher has been without a deputy headteacher or any senior leader for most of the autumn term her time has been too stretched. Lengthy and time-consuming meetings with parents, unions, staff and external agencies have taken leaders’ and governors’ focus away from school improvement and building capacity to improve within the school.&#xa0;
