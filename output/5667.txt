[[[Examination of Witnesses]]]

[[[Rebecca Taylor MEP]]], ALDE, UK, Vice-President of the Youth Intergroup, and 

[[[Luca Scarpiello]]], Adviser to the Youth Intergroup&#xa0;

[[[Q162 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[The Chairman:]]] It is very kind of you to give this time to us. Rebecca, you are the Vice-President of the Youth Intergroup?

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: Yes.

[[[The Chairman:]]] That is right. Luca Scarpiello. Lord Freeman, can you introduce yourself?

[[[Q163 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Freeman:]]] Roger Freeman, Conservative Peer, former Member of Parliament. May I ask you very briefly to explain what the Youth Intergroup is?

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: Right, yes. There are a number of intergroups. They are a little bit like APPGs, but the difference is that there are a maximum number of intergroups, whereas obviously with APPGs you can have as many as you like as long as enough people sign up. There is quite a competition for the Intergroup. Is it 12 or 14 members?

[[[Luca Scarpiello]]]: Fourteen.

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: It is 14, yes. There are 14 intergroups in total and anything else is an interest group or a working group. It does not have the official status of an intergroup. Youth Intergroup is one of the 14 intergroups and, obviously, youth employment is a big issue.

[[[Lord Freeman:]]] Based here?

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: Yes. It is cross-party. They are always cross-party. The president of the intergroup is from the Socialists &amp; Democrats Group, and then I am the Vice-President from ALDE, from the Liberals, and then there are Vice-Presidents from the Greens, from the EPP, and from GUE—correct?

[[[Luca Scarpiello]]]: Yes.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Right. We are trying to get the Members of this Committee to introduce themselves. Lord Freeman, how many years in Parliament?

[[[Lord Freeman:]]] Thirty-one.

[[[The Chairman:]]] In both Houses. Lord Brooke, can you introduce yourself?

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] I am Clive Brooke. I am a Labour Peer. I have been there about 16 years, prior to which I was in the Labour movement as a union general secretary for tax staff.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Yes, beloved by all.

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: I have just paid my tax bill this weekend.

[[[The Chairman:]]] So did I.

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] I am David Wilson. I am an independent Cross-Bench Peer, 20 years or so in the House of Lords. Before that, I had quite an involvement in Asia, but China and Hong Kong rather than Japan, which is your subject, is it not?

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: I did study Japanese, yes.

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] At Leeds?

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: Yes, at Leeds.

[[[The Chairman:]]] I am Detta O’Cathain. I emigrated to the UK nearly 50 years ago and I have been in the House of Lords for 22 years. I came up the business route. I was not in Parliament. I was not in the House of Commons and I was not a member of a political party, but I am a Conservative and I sit on the Conservative Benches. This Committee is a sub-committee of the overall Select Committee of the European Union. We have the remit of the internal market, infrastructure and employment. The reason we are doing this inquiry and that these four Members, the three of them and me, are representing 12 members of our sub-committee, is that we have the responsibility to scrutinise all the documentation that comes within those three areas of business. This particular issue of youth unemployment and the Youth Guarantee and all these issues that the EU has been concentrating on, quite rightly, were ones that we felt that we ought to get involved with. We are doing a report, which will come out in mid-April, and, of course, we will send you a copy.

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: Excellent.

[[[The Chairman:]]] After this session, you will receive a transcript of the session to check and correct. This will be put on the public record in printed form and on the parliamentary website. Again, I reiterate: thank you very much indeed.

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: No problem.

[[[Q164 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[The Chairman:]]] Now, if you want to make a brief one-minute opening statement, either of you or both, please feel free before we get on to the questions.

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: The questions cover pretty much anything I might want to say, so I would just go through the questions.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Okay. Thank you very much indeed.

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: I will probably give the overview and then Luca will give the detail. The general consensus is that there is a jobs crisis in Europe full stop, but that it has been felt far more acutely by young people. Even in those countries where youth unemployment is not such a serious problem, it is still more difficult for under-25s to get a job. There is a lot of concern that if it is not tackled you will get this lost generation thing where if people suffer unemployment or precarious employment for a number of years, it has a knock-on effect on their long-term career prospects.There are a number of things to look at. One is obviously the demand side. Employers are simply recruiting fewer workers, and particularly are recruiting fewer young workers, because the less experience you have, the more difficult it is to get into the employment market. That is where it is important to look at incentives that help businesses hire young people, and also obviously incentives that help companies in the right sectors. For example, we had the Green Jobs initiative in the UK; that is a very good example. It is not willy-nilly. It is really for areas that are considered to have growth potential, because, obviously, if those areas grow there will be more jobs and more jobs for young people. There is also the problem of two-tier labour markets where you have a core of people who are highly protected and young people who just do not get a chance to get that kind of employment protection and end up with work that is either temporary or—

[[[The Chairman:]]] Seasonal?

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: Yes, seasonal. I would say freelance, but freelance is something in my mind a little bit different that people choose to do. I know that in Italy you have this contract called the co.co.co.

[[[Luca Scarpiello]]]: Yes.

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: Maybe you can explain what that is.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Right, so this is your statement.

[[[Luca Scarpiello]]]: Yes. Well, in Italy the comparison with the UK system is the zero-hour contract, which basically is also now in discussion not only in Italy but all over Europe, because those types of contract have a huge social cost, especially if they are not also matched by reforms to the welfare system that balance the on-call nature of the job with the income stability of the person.In general, completing what Rebecca was saying, one of the biggest mistakes that we are doing today in Europe is to consider youth employment as something aside from the general employment crisis that we are having in Europe. I do not have to remind you of the economic outlook and also of the employment outlook. It is clear that instead this is a part of this outlook and, in general, it is also clear that we will not improve the situation of young people in the labour market unless we are triggering consistent industrial policy, especially at European level, that can support enterprises to invest again and also, of course, to invest in the labour market in human resources.When we talk about the special features of young people and their approach to employment, of course, first of all we have to consider that so far they have been—if you see the OECD report on this—the ones that have paid the highest toll in the economic crisis so far. They are also the key potential to trigger a new recovery in Europe and also to trigger what we call the ecological conversion of our society, especially if you consider that we are talking about the most skilled generation ever.

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: The whole green jobs agenda, yes.

[[[Luca Scarpiello]]]: When it comes to the actions that we could take in the labour market, also completing what Rebecca was saying, it is important to consider three main dimensions that are fundamental.The first one is the demand side. Because we have a number of structural barriers to youth employment today in Europe, and also in the UK, of course, starting from the consideration that the crisis has degraded the productive manufacturing fabric and this has delayed the investment and employment of new human resources, it is, therefore, fundamental to stimulate the industrial and productive system, especially in the more innovative technologies. Investment in the more innovative technologies is today also a way to fight youth unemployment.The second is, of course, that in Europe—and this is a shared problem with the UK—we have a strong duality and segmentation of the labour market. It is a matter of fact that young people today are the most exposed to the problems of stability in the labour market, the first ones to be dismissed, and the last ones to be hired. For this, a reference for you could be the OECD employment index for regular contracts. We have seen that in the past the legislation when it comes especially to hiring for temporary contracts—we have seen in the UK the zero-hours contract—did not have an impact on the hiring preparation of the enterprises. This is not an opinion; this is a fact that was put together by the OECD in the last Economic Outlook. Therefore, when it comes to reducing the barriers, the priority should be to reduce the segmentation especially between temporary and stable contracts and try to reduce the gap in a way.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Yes, that is the detail. Overall, would you agree that it is probably the most difficult problem facing the European Union at the moment?

[[[Luca Scarpiello]]]: Absolutely.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Shall we get into the questions now?

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: Yes.

[[[Q165 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[The Chairman:]]] Thank you. The general consensus, as I said, is that the current youth unemployment across Europe is the most serious aspect of the current economic crisis. Could you summarise for us in your own view exactly what the nature of the current problems are and what issues you are most concerned about? I think you have more or less done that, have you not, both of you?

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: Yes. One of the issues is, as I say, the precariousness. You also have unpaid internships in there as well, where the opportunities are only for certain people. You have an issue there. The Youth Intergroup has been doing quite a lot of work on that because there is also the issue that people even get a paid internship and then when they go for a job they say, “Oh, you have never done a real job.”

[[[The Chairman:]]] Yes, quite.

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: So they end up in a kind of vicious circle of doing five or six, or maybe not five or six but—

[[[The Chairman:]]] They cannot take you because you are inexperienced—

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: But you have been working for three years.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Yes, exactly.

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: Yes, that is an issue. Luca mentioned briefly the issue of welfare systems. They need to be able to support young people so that if, for example, you have a temporary job and then that ends, there needs to be that support so that you do not completely fall out of the labour market and you do not lose touch with the labour market. Obviously, that has to be conditional; if there is training or help on offer, you need actively to be looking for a job. I think nobody disagrees with that.

[[[Q166 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[The Chairman:]]] To what extent do you see the issue as being about the demand side, the availability of jobs, and to what extent the supply side, how well young people are prepared for the labour market with regard to their skills or employability?

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: It is both, really. There was rising youth unemployment previously, certainly in the UK when there was a boom, and that was among a certain section of the population. Graduates were not included in that, for example, so it was a skills issue. The youth unemployment now is not just those with lower skills. It is graduates as well. In my day—I graduated in 1997—it was almost impossible not to get a job. The only people who did not get a job were people who really did not want one. A friend of mine tried being unemployed for a few months but he gave up because it was easier to find a job. Seriously, he just wanted a rest. He had worked so hard for his exams; he just wanted a rest.It is a very different situation now. I have a stepbrother and it has taken him a year to find a job. He has been cleaning a pub. He is a maths graduate and he has been cleaning a pub. He has an appropriate job now, but he was prepared to do anything in order to work. That is something that when I graduated in 1997 would have been almost unheard of. Obviously, it is much more difficult for people who do not have qualifications, but that does not mean that it is necessarily easy because we have the problem of graduate unemployment, which existed already in a number of European countries before the crisis. You have problems that did not happen, for example, in the UK, in Germany, in the Netherlands. There are the OECD recommendations, which are aimed less, I would say, at the skilled or highly educated employees and more at minimising school drop-out, promoting a combination of work and study, which is what we are having in the UK now with the apprenticeships, and offering people a second chance to get a qualification.

[[[Q167 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[The Chairman:]]] What role should different stakeholders play in tackling youth unemployment—for example, the Commission, national Governments, businesses or trade unions—and how does the work of the Youth Intergroup feed into this dialogue?

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: Yes. Well, obviously, this is something that cannot come only from Government; it has to involve trade unions, youth organisations and employers.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Educationalists?

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: Education and training providers, yes. They all have their role to play. What we do in the Youth Intergroup is work very closely with the European Youth Forum, which is the umbrella organisation of youth organisations across Europe. We work very closely with the forum. We also, obviously, have contact with businesses and with trade union organisations in Brussels. We do that anyway because you cannot not have that dialogue; it is really important. The countries that we know that have done better on youth unemployment than others are ones where they have a strong social dialogue that does involve all the actors. Finland is a very good example.We do a lot of joint events with the Youth Forum. When we have panels we always have a representative from the Youth Forum speaking. We usually have a representative from a trade union or from an employers’ organisation. For example, for the one on internships we had someone from Microsoft there. We do that actively in what we do. It is never just the Youth Intergroup. It is always involving different stakeholders.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Lord Freeman, this is an issue that you should contend with. Is there anything else you want to ask before you come in?

[[[Q168 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Freeman:]]] Well, I am interested in your views, looking at 13, 14 and 15 year-olds in our education system—I am now looking at the UK; I do not have experience with other countries—about whether there are policies and interventions that could usefully prepare young people for the world of work, which now is so totally different from 20 or 30 years ago.

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: Yes. It is interesting. The Youth Intergroup has not addressed this yet, but one thing I have raised a couple of times is the issue of careers education and not necessarily employability skills but almost job-hunting skills, if that makes sense. From personal experience, I see that there is a huge difference. For example, when we advertised Luca’s role, we had 280 applicants from almost every country across Europe. Obviously, there are different styles to do a CV and so on; this is marginal. There was a big difference in the quality of the applications. Probably 200 of them could be immediately dismissed because there was not—

[[[Lord Freeman:]]] Was that literacy, attitude, experience, behaviour?

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: No, it was not literacy, not generally, and it was not qualifications. It was that they could have been applying for any job, any job whatever. In fact, they might as well have just written on their application, “I would like a job”, because that is essentially what it said. They did not look at the role. They did not look at the Youth Intergroup. They did not look at the kind of things we do.Having said that, there were 40 applicants who were really good, who did look at the job and showed how they had some interest. Obviously, Luca did extremely well because he got the job. I was just really struck. These were, in some cases, people who went to very good universities, world-renowned universities, and I am saying, “What kind of preparation are people getting for job hunting?” Clearly, some of them knew how to do an application and some of them did not have a clue.This is something we have not addressed, unfortunately, and I think it is something that is very local. There are different trends. For example, in France, it is normal to put your photo on a CV. We do not do that in the UK, it would be slightly strange. In Germany, you send all the references and your qualifications with an application. In Belgium, nobody asks you for copies of your degree. There are different customs or traditions, which obviously it is useful to know. This is something we have not looked into, but I would like to.It links back also to the point about 13, 14 and 15 year-olds because I have contact with an organisation that makes packs for schools and works a lot with schools in Yorkshire. They work across the country. They say it is vital to get children before that age. At that age some of them are already switching off because they do not see the link between the education they are doing and what they might want to do in later life. The guy I spoke to from the training company gave an example, saying that he went to give a talk and a young man said, “Yes, I would like to be a blacksmith”. He said, “Well, maybe doing chemistry and physics would be quite useful if you want to do that”. Although he loved horses and he wanted to do that, he had not made the connection with what he was studying, and realised that it was a step on to what he might want to do. I have not seen any perfect solutions, unfortunately, but I think it is something that certainly does need to be addressed.

[[[Lord Freeman:]]] I have a short follow-up. Would you agree with me—putting on hold my next question—that we should focus on 13, 14 and 15 year-olds, very often the children of single parents, for example, with perhaps very little experience being brought to the table by the teaching profession? This is no criticism of the teaching profession. Do you agree with me that that is a particularly important age group? I am not talking about university graduates, but motivating young people and getting them to think about what they can and should be able to do?

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: As I say, the people that I spoke to said it should be happening even before then because by then some of them may have already switched off, which is exactly what you do not want to happen. Yes, I think it is something that is neglected, and if you leave it for another five years, they are biding their time for five years if only to get out.

[[[Luca Scarpiello]]]: Just on this a couple of things and then I will come back to the question concerning the social dialogue.The problem is also that in Europe this issue of the 13, 14 and 15 year-olds has been tackled many times. One of the key issues within the Europe 2020 strategy is to reduce the dropout rate. Of course, at the moment we have also seen with the crisis the dropout making very little progress. Therefore, this has to be one of the priority areas. Many countries, for instance, are using an earlier canalisation into technical or regular secondary schools, which is not necessarily the right solution if you do not also create the possibility for young people to pass from one path to the others. Of course, at that age is the earliest you are doing the canalisation. There is very little chance for the students to understand their potential, so you have to create the possibility for one person to pass from one path to the other, maybe to attend university afterwards or a further professional or vocational training opportunity afterwards.Let me also say in this regard that we have to change our strategies a bit when it comes to reducing the dropout; for instance, involving the community-based and youth organisations much more. Non-formal education strategies could also be extremely useful to provide young people with the soft skills that are necessary to the labour market today. We have a bit to do to reduce the boundaries between schools and what is outside schools, which has been today in Europe the problem.Concerning what the different stakeholders can do, as Youth Intergroup we had one priority: to make sure that the Youth Guarantee is not something done only by the Government. We have to create ownership of the process by different stakeholders. Of course, there is on one side the social dialogue that is fundamental, and on the other side youth organisations, the community-based organisations and civil society that must have a role. This is also why in the negotiation of the framework of the Social Fund we put the provision that in order to use the funds of the youth employment initiative there has to be also an involvement of the social partners and the youth organisation when it comes to designing and assessing the schemes. It is also something that in the UK must be implemented, especially for the regions that request the funds; in particular, in London, Merseyside, the south-west, Scotland, and so on.

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: There are only a certain number of regions that qualify for the European Social Fund.

[[[Q169 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] I was going to deal with the three main elements of the initiative that you run. Before that, could I just raise a question on the issue of dropouts? Is this a competency of the EU or is it, in fact, national?

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: No, it is national. It is part of the European strategy, but obviously it is something implemented at national level. There is no EU competence in education. Obviously there are programmes that people can benefit from, but, it is all national.

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] I am not disputing you; I am just raising the question.

[[[Luca Scarpiello]]]: On this I just want to say that we have the open method of co-ordination on this issue, which is not saying that we have to take over the competence from the member state but we need to co-ordinate the strategy on this. ERASMUS+, the new programme for education and training for the next economic cycle, is also putting a number of funds available in this regard.

[[[Q170 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] That leads us then on to the question now about the three strands of the approach. We have talked about the youth employment programme with a link to the Youth Guarantee, which at present we do not, as you are aware, have in the UK. We have the youth employment initiative with the €6 billion now being allocated to it, and now we have within the European Social Fund a push to have more of the money that would be spent between 2014 and 2020 to go towards youth unemployment. I know it is rather early in certain areas to give a judgment on how the initiative will work, but generally what do you think about it? Do you think it is going to work well or do you think there are other changes that are needed and, if so, what would you suggest should be looked at?

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: I think it is a very good step in the right direction because there needed to be something. Some countries were already doing things. The UK has been doing things with apprenticeships and the Youth Guarantee, but there was not anything that was EU-wide and was expanding to other countries. Now, in order to get these funds, the countries have to implement a Youth Guarantee scheme. That is a really positive development. It is all designed to stop people falling out of the labour market for too long early in their careers, and I think that is vital.At the moment, what Luca has kindly done is put together some information on what is being done in different countries. Obviously, we cannot judge it yet. We do not know if it is successful yet because it is only being implemented right now. In some countries there are only some regions that are eligible. In the UK there are a few. It depends. In Belgium it seems to be the south. Luca has kindly put this together and we are happy to share this document with you. It is probably quite useful.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Very useful indeed.

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: I am not going to go through all of it because there is quite a bit. We cannot yet say whether it is going to work. The criticism that was made at the beginning is that it is not enough money. If I recall correctly, it is €6 billion in total, but that works out to be roughly €600 for each unemployed young person whom you want to help. If I think what the UK Youth Guarantee is, it is much more than that for employers. I think it is about double that, is it not? It is a lot more than €600. There have been some people saying it is not enough, but it is a lot more than what was originally proposed.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Yes, but great oaks from little acorns grow.

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: Exactly, that is the plan.

[[[The Chairman:]]] It could be seen as seed corn, could it not?

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: Yes, hopefully. The idea, obviously, is that this does not take away other measures that are happening at national level. It is in addition to, not instead of—for those regions that need it—the ability to use the European Social Fund for youth employment measures and the strong encouragement that I think is really important. We are right at the beginning of this now, so it is a massive step in the right direction because the ultimate aim of the Youth Guarantee is that no one is out of work or training for more than six months. Is it six months or four months?

[[[Luca Scarpiello]]]: Four.

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: Sorry, it is four months. That is a really key point if it will be implemented correctly.

[[[Luca Scarpiello]]]: I will address a complementary small point that is fundamental. To focus, to concentrate the effect of the funds, there has been a front-loading of the fund from having been spread throughout the seven years into the first two years. Of course, this is important because, for instance, for the UK regions we will have something like €192 million available, but at the same time it is posing a number of questions for the continuity of the programme afterwards. This is something that, of course, also the legislators in the UK have to take into consideration while planning the measures.The second thing is we have to understand that the Youth Guarantee is, let us say, an incentive to change culturally the way our active employment services are conceived, from young people who have to go to the public employment services if they are unemployed to public employment services that go to young people and together think about a personalised path. Therefore, a Youth Guarantee without an effective reform of the public employment services and without everything we said about economic and manufacturing development is ineffective because it is not by itself creating one single job place.

[[[Q171 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] As you know, what we are trying to do in this group and this report is get a clearer picture of what the EU as such does on unemployment, since it is a massive issue for all the nation states of the European Union. The question is: what is the EU doing? It did seem to me that your Youth Intergroup should have a very good handle on which member states you think are making good use of what Europe is putting forward and which are not. You might even want to comment on how the UK does on that list.

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: We have not done an in-depth analysis but, yes, if you look across Europe I do not think it is a coincidence that the countries with the strongest higher vocational training systems are those with the lowest youth unemployment.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Like Germany.

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: Like Germany, like the Netherlands, like Austria. I do not think that is a coincidence. In those countries, there are fewer people who go to university but it does not mean they have a less skilled labour market. Certainly, this is not revolutionary at all, but in the UK in the past 15 to 20 years I would not say there was a dismissing of higher vocational education but an assumption that if you were in any way bright you must go to university. There were not any other options. The other options were not good enough. They were inferior. I think this has been a big mistake. I happen to know how it works in Germany because I have family who are teachers in Germany. If after school you get an apprenticeship and you work partly in a company and you go to college one or two days a week—to a technische hochschule usually—that is not in any way looked down upon as being inferior to university. It is just different. That is something that we are tackling in the UK with the increase of apprenticeships, but certainly we can look at the countries that have these much stronger and very integrated systems of higher vocational education—very integrated with employers.

[[[Q172 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] Could I just follow up a bit? Personally, I have a great deal of sympathy with what you are saying. We made a very sad mistake in calling our technical colleges, which are extremely efficient, universities and making them into research bodies rather than practical ones. Just getting more on to the question of which countries pick up the initiatives from Europe best, you are implying that it is the countries that do that, but I am not sure quite how that relates to the policies that the Commission has put forward.

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] Or, to put it another way, were they doing it themselves before the initiatives came up?

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: This is it, yes. The whole point of the open method of co-ordination is that it gives the opportunity for countries to learn from others. It is not decentralised policy that everybody is following; it is more like a procedure by which there can be exchange of best practice and things like that. That is exactly what the open method of co-ordination is used for, because it is areas where there is not any competence. It is used also in health.

[[[Q173 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] On Lord Brooke’s point, then, which is the chicken and which is the egg? Is it EU policies and the Commission that are making countries like Germany, Austria and Finland—which you  mentioned—behave in a particular way, or were they behaving in that particular way already, and are therefore more efficient at dealing with the problem of unemployment?

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: Yes, obviously the German system of higher vocational education was not created in the past three years.

[[[The Chairman:]]] No, quite.

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: It is a long-term thing. That shows us how those countries are better adapted to take advantage of further opportunities like they have now, and hopefully provides an opportunity for other countries to say, “That is a good way to do it”. It is sometimes a bit woolly because it is an open method of co-ordination.

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] Are you doing research in these areas?

[[[Luca Scarpiello]]]: Yes. I will give you a technical answer and then I will try to elaborate on this.In the new cycle of the MFF especially, there has been a shift of the priorities in the sense that now the structural funds, and in general also funds like ERASMUS+ and the Youth Unemployment Initiative, are there to support member states to do the so-called structural reforms, basically, in the sense that we support you and we will give you money to have enough leverage to put forward certain reforms that are important into the labour market and into the key areas. This is quite a big change because, of course, it channels the projects that the regions are doing into political policy processes and reform policies that are considered important. For instance, in the UK in the past seven years you received €700 million for young people, which was used basically to activate NEET and to activate strategies for young people that were not studying or in employment. For instance, there was the Training for Success programme in Scotland, the new enterprise allowance for entrepreneurship, and other projects in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as well that were used.

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] These are devolved Administrations, of course, not in England.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Exactly, yes. They have their own responsibility for that area, not the UK. I take it from the tenor of your comments that you think that this was not the most efficient use of resources?

[[[Luca Scarpiello]]]: I tell you that this is the new strategy behind why, for instance, the youth employment initiative has been created. In general, there is also the fact that, of course, the economic crisis put a lot of pressure on public funds and many regions, especially in the southern countries, now have only the EU funds to make a bit of leverage when it comes to employment reforms of the welfare system and so on. I would say that in some countries this is really the oxygen for the regions to implement certain measures; for instance, the activation policies for young people. Without this money, in countries like Italy, Spain and Greece, for instance, there is nothing else. We have to be very aware of this. Sometimes the EU is not complementing but initiating, and in some cases it is the only source that the member state has.

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] Sorry, Chairman, can I just pin that one down? I introduced myself as being an independent Cross-Bench Peer. I should have said that I was an independent Scottish Cross-Bench Peer. Do you have a note anywhere of what you just said about what is being done in Scotland and Wales?

[[[Luca Scarpiello]]]: Yes, we can send you the information.

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] I would be very interested. It is not one that has come our way, as far as I know, in what we have been doing so far.

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] We have had a submission from an MEP in Wales, which was quite different.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Yes, we did.

[[[Luca Scarpiello]]]: Especially if you are from Scotland, the priority has also been on apprenticeships and internships. There are very good programmes on this. Of course, we can send you information, but it is also available on the website.

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] Yes, thank you very much.

[[[Q174 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[The Chairman:]]] As you mentioned apprenticeships over and over and over again, I must say that I fear that it is a grossly misunderstood word. The apprenticeships in Germany would be nothing like the apprenticeships given by McDonald’s, of which there are 10,000 in the UK. I am just wondering if there is anywhere some written information with an analysis of apprenticeship schemes throughout the EU, because I think we are in danger of recommending something that may not be fit for purpose.

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: I have encountered a number of apprenticeships across the region. They are not McDonald’s. We are talking a minimum of three years and you end up with an HND/HNC-level qualification. It is true that the level of NVQ that you get from an apprenticeship can vary.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Yes. I would like to interject and say I think what McDonald’s is doing is terrific. The 10,000 people doing the apprenticeships stay with McDonald’s and are promoted and go on, so they get additional skills—customer relations being one, for example, which is very important and is never mentioned. It is just that I am getting utterly confused now about the different interpretations of that word.

[[[Luca Scarpiello]]]: Maybe you could also take a look at the work of Eurofound—the European agency for improving working and living conditions—on apprenticeships. Basically, there is a main difference between an internship and an apprenticeship. In some countries, an apprenticeship is a working and training contract that should lead to the stabilisation of the worker after a period of training in-house. The problem is that the internships instead are completely outside this path. Of course, the strategy that many countries are using—not only Italy but also, for instance, France—is to use much more the apprenticeship contractors, the prevalent ones, maybe through a system of guarantees that could lead to stabilisation. For this reason also on the internships, we as the Youth Intergroup are working now with the European Parliament. Now there is a scheme that the European Commission has drafted on the quality framework for internships. It is also something valuable where you can look at it as creating a quality framework, because an experience that is not quality is not helping the students and we are just creating social dumping, because basically we see also the phenomena of enterprises that are using interns instead of paid work. We cannot create in Europe a secondary sub-labour market.

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] Sorry, I was just going to make a note. I think your contributions are very helpful.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Yes, absolutely.

[[[Q175 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] Going back to the young people, are you aware of the ways in which the perspective, ideas and views of young people themselves are being gathered to help different bodies at EU, national or local government level? Do you think we have the proper infrastructure to marshal and utilise the contribution that younger people can make in these areas, particularly in regard to developing policy? I personally have a bee in my bonnet about our own Department for Work and Pensions. Do they ever bring together unemployed people, the hard to reach people, and talk to them? Are there any countries that might do that? I think often when you can bring people with common problems together you can get new common solutions that you would not normally alight on.

[[[The Chairman:]]] New insight.

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] New insight, yes.

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: At European level, as I think I explained before, the Youth Intergroup does. Yes, we certainly do that and we get really useful input. We work always with umbrella organisations. They have members all across Europe, so you really do get that input. I see a lot of youth organisations myself but not specifically on youth unemployment. Certainly, I do not see any reason why they should not be involved. I have not been involved with that at national level, not specifically on this topic, because it does not actually fall in any of my committees. It is just what I do for the Youth Intergroup. I sit on committees that do not touch these issues.

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] Are there any youth organisations that maybe—

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: Yes. We have worked with the Youth Council and the Youth Parliament. I have had various things, obviously almost exclusively within the Yorkshire region, on a lot of different issues. It is more that they want to know about the European Union, so it is more general, but some of them have some fantastic projects that they have done themselves. These are very local projects. You have 15 year-olds negotiating with bus companies to have a ride-around-all-day ticket in the summer, just really good stuff. Some of the ones I met are Youth Parliament members and some of them are youth councillors. We work through some of the youth policy people in the councils, but I have not done it specifically looking at youth unemployment measures; it has been more on the education front.

[[[Luca Scarpiello]]]: Let me mention two processes that can help you. The first one is structured dialogue. As you know, in youth policies we have a structured dialogue with young people in youth organisations. This is something that can be used. It is basically grass-roots consultation from local to national to European level that should feed into a council conclusion or resolution. Each presidency is on a different issue. There has been one on youth employment whose result you can easily check. I can also send it to you if you wish.In general, the problem of those consultations is that on one side, okay, you get consulted. The problem is what you do with this as legislators. Of course, we in the European Parliament have the same problem, I would say. As the Youth Intergroup, we are trying to give as much space as possible to young people and youth organisations. As Rebecca said, we are key partners with the European Youth Forum. There are also a lot of British organisations like the British Youth Council—BYC—and so on. How to implement and mainstream those processes into our legislative work and your legislative work I think is the biggest challenge that we have. Young people are asking you, not me, to impact their lives and their conditions, and it is still an ongoing process and ongoing question on how to further give them the sense of ownership of what we are building at European level.

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: The Youth Intergroup did one thing that was quite key in the ERASMUS+ programme. There is a part of that where people can get loans of up to €16,000 to do a Master’s degree. It is kind of a student loan system. We have that facility in the UK but probably maybe less interest because there are career development loans. There are some countries where that kind of loan does not exist, so this is not to replace national systems but to have another option and in some cases introduce. Basically, you are giving the opportunity to people who do not have parents who can support them to take the loan and complete the Master’s degree. Originally, the procedure for repayment was that after one year you had to start paying back come what may. We said, “What if you have not found a job?” The people at the Commission I think have been out of the labour market for some time. They said, “Oh, everyone who has a Master’s degree finds a job”. We were like, “No, they do not”.

[[[The Chairman:]]] This is in the Commission?

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: The people who are probably a bit older than me and have not looked for a job for some time genuinely thought that if you had a Master’s degree there would be no issue with finding employment. We were saying, “No, that is not the case”.We basically pushed some amendments to say that obviously it is up to each member state how they do it, but there should be some kind of link to your income. Therefore, obviously, if you did not have a job or you had a very low income you could defer payment, which is basically a principle of almost all the national student loan schemes anyway. It is the same in Germany. It is the same in the Scandinavian countries. That was, in a way, a small point, but it got to the heart of the whole policy because without that you would put people off taking the loan who are exactly the kind of people who need it because they do not have parents who can help them out. We managed to do that and we did that as the Youth Intergroup rather than as individuals. We did make that change so it was quite important.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Well done.

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: Yes, because otherwise students are either not going to take it out—they are not going to take advantage of the scheme—or we are going to get horror stories in the press of people who are unemployed and are being forced to pay back this loan for a Master’s degree, which we just thought was horrible. As I say, it was a relatively small thing but the impact hopefully is larger, though obviously that is only one small bit of the ERASMUS programme for those who want to do Master’s degrees. Most people will not do that. That is something that was quite obvious to us. One of our vice-presidents, who is now in the Bundestag, had had a loan like that in Germany and knew exactly how it worked. She said, “I could have deferred my loan if I had not had a job”, which makes sense. That was an example of where you can make a difference.

[[[Q176 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[The Chairman:]]] Can I just ask how well prepared you think youth are nowadays for a job?

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: It varies tremendously.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Is it different by country? Is there a job-shy country or a job-wanting country?

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: No.

[[[Luca Scarpiello]]]: May I give you an answer also? For instance, on internships, the Youth Forum did a very interesting survey on the quality of internships in Europe, asking young people to say why they were doing that internship and how many internships they have done before. One of the things that at the time, one year ago, was extremely interesting was to see that young people have studied, but the problem is that we saw that the requests of the companies have changed tremendously. I will give you an example. Before, the enterprises were seeing in you a potential that would have been developed throughout your working life, and there were a number of training aspects that were done in-house by the company that had an interest in investing in your potential. The problem now is the crisis, but this could also be seen before the crisis. The enterprises are externalising the burden of the preparation of young people. Basically, what they are asking is that you have to be ready, trained, when you arrive. This responsibility is a cultural change that somehow we need to prevent. This is also why there is the priority on the apprenticeships because at some point all the burden of the qualification cannot stay on young people who are already doing a lot, but you cannot ask one person to be trapped in six or seven internships in a row. Part of the responsibility is also in the entrepreneur culture and how the productive system also perceives the training.

[[[Q177 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[The Chairman:]]] In fact, would you say that, like apprenticeships, the definition of internship is completely different even within a country, let alone from country to country?

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: Even between companies or different employers, yes.

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] It is a worrying development.

[[[The Chairman:]]] It is very worrying.

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: There is actually a Facebook blacklist in Brussels. I do not know who runs it because they keep themselves anonymous for obvious reasons. They have put on there details of organisations that basically exploit interns and do not give them proper training or pay them and so on. Obviously, that is done unofficially.It is something that I saw being tackled where I worked previously, because I used to work in a think tank in Westminster. We used to originally pay both travel expenses and lunch, but then we went, “No, that is not acceptable”. Now they get the London living wage.Our internships were always publicly advertised, because that is another issue: how widely advertised roles are. When I recruit I have always done it completely openly. They are on the website. They are on various job sites where you would expect people to look. In many cases, I have hired people I had never met before, never had any contact with whatever. When we recruited in the Youth Intergroup, we also tried to make it as wide as possible, which is why we got 280 applications for one role.

[[[The Chairman:]]] For one job.

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: Yes. We nearly cried when we saw the number of CVs we had to read through.

[[[Luca Scarpiello]]]: We are doing a campaign to eradicate from the European Parliament the unpaid internships in the members’ offices.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Yes, but what do the interns think about that? Maybe they think that this is a huge investment in their future and now you are going to jeopardise their future.

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: Well, you are only jeopardising the future of those who have parents wealthy enough to support them.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Oh, I see.

[[[Luca Scarpiello]]]: No, let me answer this. Each member of the European Parliament has €21,000 for office costs and staff costs per month. There is no single reason why you should not pay your interns. It is again a cultural problem. Of course, it is a burden. It is given always to young people. I can tell you that in Italy, for instance, I was at that time in one committee of the Government regulating the internships. We asked the Government to stop any unpaid internships in the public agencies. We had a co-partnership between the Conference of Italian University Rectors and foreign ministers that gave the possibility for 1,000 young people to go outside to work in the embassies for free. What CRUI—the Conference of Italian University Rectors—and the foreign ministers did was instead of saying, “Okay, we will put 3 million—only 3 million in Italy—to finance the programme”, they closed the programme. Of course, the young people thought that we were the bad people because the Government was closing it, but then I must ask as a legislator: who was acting responsibly? Which principle was the winning one? Politics is also about principles.

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: I just think it is not acceptable to have an unpaid internship because you do not make the opportunity available to everybody. Someone should be getting an opportunity to progress their career based on their ability, not based on their ability to have parents who can fund their living expenses.We did an event in the Parliament and there was someone speaking who had been on the Microsoft internship programme, which is apparently a very good one. I believe they had previously signed the quality internships charter. There was someone making the point exactly as you were, saying, “Yes, my internship is unpaid but I am getting really good experience and it is going to look great on my CV”. I said, “Who is paying your rent and who is feeding you?” Of course the answer was his parents. I said, “If you were borrowing €1,000 a month for your living expenses, or you had to say no to that internship because you had no way of putting a roof over your head and feeding yourself, I think you would feel very different”. I thought I was being a bit mean to him, but the point is that it is very easy to say that when you have someone else providing for you. I just do not think that opportunity should be available based on how wealthy your parents are. It is something I feel quite strongly about, as you might have guessed.

[[[The Chairman:]]] I gathered that, yes. I always admire people who have passion, even if it is misdirected. I am not saying yours is at all. Thank you both very much indeed.

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: No problem.

[[[The Chairman:]]] It has been very useful. Before you go, if you think there are some areas we really should have questioned you on or if you think that there is something that we could—

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: Yes, when we send you, for example, this document, which is the overview of different—

[[[The Chairman:]]] Yes, could you do an aide-mémoire, if you like, on what we should be thinking of?

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: Yes, sure.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Thank you very much indeed. It has been a great pleasure.

[[[Luca Scarpiello]]]: Can we take a picture for our website?

[[[Rebecca Taylor]]]: Yes, we have to.

[[[Luca Scarpiello]]]: Unfortunately, it is not me deciding the communication. It is important for politicians.

[[[The Chairman:]]] That is the second time we have been asked for our photographs today. Do not forget we have been up for about 14 or 15 hours.&#xa0;
