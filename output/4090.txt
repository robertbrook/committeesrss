[[[Written submission from Bill Manning (BRC 68)]]]&#xa0;Part P seems a waste of time, very bureaucratic, any individual can purchase electrical accessories from say B&amp;Q, carry out electrical installations, theoretically only just need to submit building notice to comply.Â  &#xa0;Part P is if applied is reactive rather than proactive, if non-qualified person install, may not notify Building Control, and how do you evaluate an installation after completion, hard to see if electrics comply with BS after installation by potential novice.&#xa0;I strongly believe that electrical works should only be carried out by qualified electricians, need something like gas safe legislation.&#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
