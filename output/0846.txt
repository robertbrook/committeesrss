[[[Executive Summary ]]]&#xa0;We welcome the Health Select Committee’s inquiry into the Management of Long-Term Conditions.

[[[ ]]]The points we would like to raise are as follows:&#xa0;1.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; Although significant improvements in the prevention and treatment of CVD over the last decade have been made, CVD remains one of the largest causes of death and disability in the UK.1.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; The Global Burden of Disease Study demonstrates that UK could do better in improving CVD mortality rates in comparison with other European countries.1.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; It is estimated that that there are approximately 2.5 million people diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and up to 850,000 undiagnosed in the UK3.1.4.&#xa0;&#xa0; The recent DUK State of the Nation report highlights that only half of people with Type 2 diabetes get the annual tests and investigations that are recommended in the national standards. Importantly, even where testing is taking place, many patients are not achieving the recommended target range for risk factors. More must be done to address this.&#xa0;2.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; A wide variation in the treatment and management of diabetes across England remains. 2.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; There are geographical inequalities across the UK in CHD mortality and this is often worse in areas of highest deprivation. 2.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; Another example of a national health inequality exists in the diagnosis and management of Familial Hypercholesterolaemia (FH) or ‘inherited high cholesterol’ across the devolved nations.2.4.&#xa0;&#xa0; The recent NHS Information Centre on the ‘Use of NICE appraised medicines in the NHS in England -2010 and 2011, Experimental Statistics’ showed that there was a variation in utilisation of medicines for long-term conditions. For example, the ratio of observed to expected usage of a NICE-approved non-statin cholesterol management therapy in the London SHA was approximately 0.6 in 2010 and 0.55 in 2011 versus nearly 0.9 in 2010 and nearly 0.8 in 2011 in the South East Coast SHA.2.5.&#xa0;&#xa0; Access restrictions to NICE approved medicines remains a problem at local formulary level, which can lead to postcode prescribing which reinforces healthcare inequalities.&#xa0;3.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; NHS spending on diabetes was almost £10 billion in 2011, which was 10 per cent of the NHS budget. 80 per cent of NHS spending on diabetes goes into managing avoidable complications. People with diabetes account for around 19 per cent of hospital inpatients at any one time, and have a three day longer stay on average than people without diabetes. Most of type 2 diabetes costs are due to hospitalisation.33.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; More effective risk factor management in the community has the potential to reduce costs to the NHS, while improving quality of care.3.2.1. Evidence into Practice (EiP) is a clinical change management programme. The programme aims to ensure that people with diabetes and those at increased cardio-metabolic risk receive optimal care through the effective implementation of national policy and guidelines, particularly NICE Type 2 Diabetes Guidelines. An example of the success of this approach was demonstrated in Greenwich. Results after one year showed that in practices who took up the programme a significant improvement in patients achieving NICE-recommended risk factor targets were achieved and substantial overall cost-savings were demonstrated due to a reduction in hospital admission rates. NICE have endorsed EiP as a proven case study for QIPP. NICE concluded that the programme scored 100% for evidence of change and 75% for both savings made and quality. This approach enabled the delivery of higher standards of care at a lower overall cost to the NHS.3.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; However, current national QIPP standards often focus on short-term drug budget savings through prescribing indicators rather than encouraging optimising medicines in line with NICE quality standards, guidelines and recommendations.3.3.1. For example, although the NICE Type 2 Diabetes guideline (CG87) outlines a number of treatment pathways based on individual patient profile utilising older and newer therapies appropriately, the QIPP prescribing comparator for diabetes is solely based on the use of low cost drugs relative to newer therapies.3.3.2. Medicine optimisation is about ensuring the right patients get the right choice of medicine at the right time and how patients comply. National measure of quality such as QIPP prescribing comparators and other outcome indicators should be focussed around NICE quality standards and guidance rather than stand-alone comparators that may encourage short-term savings that could have unintended costly consequences.

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; Inconsistencies exist in national guidance for treating patients and how GPs are incentivised, 4.1.1. For example, In the NICE Type 2 Diabetes Guideline (CG 87)11 it states, “Consider intensifying cholesterol-lowering therapy (with a more effective statin or cholesterol absorption inhibitor) in line with NICE guidance if there is existing or newly diagnosed cardiovascular disease, or if there is an increased albumin excretion rate, to achieve a total cholesterol level below 4.0 mmol/litre (and HDL cholesterol not exceeding 1.4 mmol/litre) or an LDL cholesterol level below 2.0 mmol/litre.”4.1.2. However, the Quality Outcomes Framework that incentivises GP states: The percentage of patients with diabetes, on the register, whose last measured total cholesterol (measured within the preceding 12 months) is 5 mmol/l or less and has an activity threshold of 40-75%.4.1.3. The European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society Guidelines are even more stringent than UK NICE guidelines for very high risk patients, they recommend an LDL-C goal of 1.8 mmol/litre and/or 50% reduction when target level cannot be reached.&#xa0;4.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; The impact of factors on quality of life &amp; productivity (such as the potential impact of hypoglycaemia in Type 2 diabetes) should be recognised, researched and acknowledged within NHS measures of long-term condition management quality throughout the system. 4.2.1. For example, DVLA guidelines state for people with diabetes when treated with medication other than insulin which carries a risk of inducing hypoglycaemia (including sulphonylureas and glinides), the following standard applies in order to retain a driving licence:&#xa0;

[[[Class 2 Drivers (buses and lorries)]]]&#xa0;

[[[Class 1 Drivers (cars and motorcycles)]]]&#xa0;The impact of hypoglycaemia on a person who is a professional driver or who drives regularly could be very significant on both quality of life and productivity if hypoglycaemia leads to losing their licence.Similarly, in the elderly even a mild episode of hypoglycaemia may lead to adverse outcomes in frail elderly patients. For example, episodes of dizziness or weakness increase the risk of falls and fracture.&#xa0;The NICE Quality Standard for Diabetes recognises the importance of hypoglycaemia and includes a measure that states: ‘People with diabetes who have experienced hypoglycaemia requiring medical attention are referred to a specialist diabetes team’.&#xa0;Quality measures recognising factors such as hypoglycaemia monitoring and/or management, should also be incentivised in QOF and CCG Outcome Indicators.

[[[              ]]]5.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; Although testing, such as the 9 Key Care Processes for Diabetes, are important testing alone cannot make a difference to outcome, healthcare professionals need to ensure action is taken on the results of tests to ensure that people’s long-term condition and risk-factors are being managed effectively3. Quality measures and outcome indicators throughout the NHS system (e.g. CCG outcome indicators) should reflect this.5.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; For example in diabetes, even where testing is taking place, many patients are not achieving the recommended target range for risk factors (e.g. although 90% of Type 2 Diabetes patients are having their HbA1c and cholesterol tested, only 60% are achieving target HbA1c levels and only 40% are achieving their target cholesterol level in England)3.5.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; Access to education of the patient and care planning is of paramount importance3. A patient should be informed and enabled to take a role in self-management of diabetes risk-factors and understand factors such as the importance of optimal blood glucose control in order to avoid serious complications.

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; With the dissolution of NHS Diabetes, there is a gap in support &amp; education for development of commissioning for diabetes services at the very time when it is most needed. 6.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; There are a wide number of data sets available for CVD and diabetes but they are often difficult to interpret and support is required on how to utilise these and help in practical implementation of commissioning.&#xa0;7.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; First Diabetes (Derbyshire) is a current of example of how integrated care can provide real improvements in care for diabetic patients, whist reducing admission rates. 7.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; See earlier example of EiP9 example, paragraph 3.2.1.&#xa0;8.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; Diabetes cost approximately £ 23.7bn in the UK in 2010/2011: £ 9.8bn in direct costs (£1bn for Type 1 diabetes and £ 8.8bn for Type 2 diabetes) and £ 13.9bn in indirect costs (£ 0.9bn and £ 13bn). In real terms, the 2035/2036 cost is estimated at £ 39.8bn: £ 16.9bn in direct costs (£ 1.8bn for Type 1 diabetes and £ 15.1bn for Type 2 diabetes) and £ 22.9bn in indirect costs (£ 2.4bn and £ 20.5bn). 8.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; It is key that there is a shift in focus from short-term cost-cutting in the community-setting to more efficient use of NHS resources, by effective prevention, diagnosis and risk-factor management to avoid costly complications and hospital treatment. This should be supported by appropriate measurement and outcome indicators.
