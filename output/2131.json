"&#xa0;\nThe Equal Rights Trust – Written evidence&#xa0;About the Equal Rights Trust&#xa0;\nThe Equal Rights Trust (ERT) is an independent international human rights organisation whose purpose is to combat discrimination and promote equality as a fundamental human right and a basic principle of social justice. ERT focuses on the complex relationship between different types of discrimination, developing strategies for translating the principles of equality into practice.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDraft Deregulation Bill: Submission of The Equal Rights Trust to the Joint Committee on the Draft Deregulation Bill&#xa0;\nTable of Contents&#xa0;\nIntroductionClause 2: Removal of Employment Tribunals’ Power to Make Wider RecommendationsBackground\nAnalysis\nClause 44: Repeal of Duty to Prepare Sustainable Community StrategyBackground\nAnalysis\nSchedule 8, Part 6: Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations: Exemption OrdersBackground\nAnalysis\nIntroduction&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(a)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe remedies available where these rights are breached (Clause 2);\n(b)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe elimination of socio-economic inequalities (Clause 44); and\n(c)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe accessibility of transport for persons with disabilities (Part 6 of Schedule 8).\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nClause 2: Removal of Employment Tribunals’ Power to Make Wider Recommendations&#xa0;\nBackground&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(a)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \na declaration as to the rights of the complainant and the respondent in relation to the matters to which the proceedings relate;\n&#xa0;\n(b)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nan order that the respondent pay compensation to the complainant; and\n&#xa0;\n(c)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nan\n appropriate recommendation.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(...) a recommendation that within a specified period the respondent takes specified steps for the purpose of obviating or reducing the adverse effect of any matter to which the proceedings relate (a) on the complainant; (b) on any other person.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAnalysis&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSanctions for breach of the right to equality must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Sanctions must provide for appropriate remedies for those whose right to equality has been breached including reparations for material and non-material damages; \nsanctions may also require the elimination of discriminatory practices and the implementation of structural, institutional, organisational, or policy change that is necessary for the realisation of the right to equality\n. [Emphasis added]\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n16. Article 2, paragraph 3, requires that States Parties make reparation to individuals whose Covenant rights have been violated. (...) The Committee notes that, where appropriate, reparation can involve restitution, rehabilitation and measures of satisfaction, such as public apologies, public memorials, \nguarantees of non-repetition and changes in relevant laws and practices\n, as well as bringing to justice the perpetrators of human rights violations.\n&#xa0;\n17. In general, the purposes of the Covenant would be defeated without an obligation integral to article 2 to take measures to prevent a recurrence of a violation of the Covenant. \nAccordingly, it has been a frequent practice of the Committee in cases under the Optional Protocol to include in its Views the need for measures, beyond a victim-specific remedy, to be taken to avoid recurrence of the type of violation in question. \nSuch measures may require changes in the State Party’s laws or practices.\n \n[Emphasis added]\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThese institutions should also be empowered to provide effective remedies, such as (...) \nguarantees of non-repetition\n (...) and State parties should ensure that these measures are effectively implemented\n.\n [Emphasis added]\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(...) requires that States parties provide reparation to women whose rights under the Convention have been violated. Such remedies should include different forms of reparation, such as (...) \nguarantees of non-repetition; changes in relevant laws and practice\n (...)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOne of the problems about the existing order of things is that individual proceedings deal only with individual problems and yet often they relate to systemic problems which require systemic solutions. It is very important that the tribunal which has heard all the evidence is able to make recommendations on a wider basis.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nClause 44: Repeal of Duty to Prepare Sustainable Community Strategy&#xa0;\nBackground&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(...) when making decisions of a strategic nature about how to exercise its functions, [to] have due regard to the desirability of exercising them in a way that is designed to reduce the inequalities of outcome which result from socio-economic disadvantage.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAnalysis&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nEquality has become a dirty word because it has come to be associated with the worst aspects of pointless political correctness and social engineering. Just look at the socio-economic duty. In reality, it would have been just another bureaucratic box to be ticked. It would have meant more time filling in forms and less time focusing on policies that will make a real difference to people’s life chances.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(...) as poverty may be both a cause and a consequence of discrimination, measures to alleviate poverty should be coordinated with measures to combat discrimination, in the pursuit of full and effective equality.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPatterns of discrimination keep people in poverty which in turn serves to perpetuate discriminatory attitudes and practices against them. In other words, discrimination causes poverty but poverty also causes discrimination. As a result, promoting equality and non-discrimination is central to tackling extreme poverty and promoting inclusion. Measures to eliminate poverty and efforts to eliminate all forms of discrimination must be understood as mutually reinforcing and complementary.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIndividuals and groups of individuals must not be arbitrarily treated on account of belonging to a certain economic or social group or strata within society. A person’s social and economic situation when living in poverty or being homeless may result in pervasive discrimination, stigmatization and negative stereotyping which can lead to the refusal of, or unequal access to, the same quality of education and health care as others, as well as the denial of or unequal access to public places.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Schedule 8, Part 6: Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations: Exemption Orders&#xa0;\nBackground&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(vii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBy moving to an administrative system, applicants for an exemption would know the result far sooner than now – perhaps in 3 months rather than 6 – 12. This would reduce uncertainty for operators and allow them to introduce vehicles sooner than they might currently feel able to due to the inherent risks and doubts which surround the current system.\n&#xa0;\n(viii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOfficial, legal, Ministerial and Parliamentary time would also be saved – indeed, it is improved efficiency in public administration that would form the main tangible benefit to be gained by the proposed change.\n&#xa0;\nAnalysis&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(...) any distinction, exclusion or restriction on the basis of disability which has the purpose or effect of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal basis with others, of all human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field. It includes all forms of discrimination, including denial of reasonable accommodation.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(...) necessary and appropriate modification and adjustments not imposing a disproportionate or undue burden, where needed in a particular case, to ensure to persons with disabilities the enjoyment or exercise on an equal basis with others of all human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1. To enable persons with disabilities to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life, States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access, on an equal basis with others, to the physical environment, \nto transportation, to information and communications, including information and communications technologies and systems, and to other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas. These measures, which shall include the identification and elimination of obstacles and barriers to accessibility, shall apply to, inter alia:\n&#xa0;\n(a) Buildings, roads, \ntransportation and other indoor and outdoor facilities, including schools, housing, medical facilities and workplaces (...)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nYearNumber of ExemptionOrders Granted2006\n1\n2007\n0\n2008\n2\n2009\n0\n2010\n1\n2011\n2\n2012\n1\n2013 (up to 31 July)\n1\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(a)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAn application is made to the Secretary of State for the exemption order;\n&#xa0;\n(b)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Secretary of State must then consult the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee and such other persons as he thinks appropriate before:\n&#xa0;\n(i)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nmaking an exemption order in the terms of the application for the order;\n(ii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nmaking an exemption order in such other terms as the Secretary of State thinks appropriate; or\n(iii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nrefusing\n to make an exemption order.\n&#xa0;\n(c)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Secretary of State must then consult the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee before deciding which parliamentary procedure available is to be adopted in connection with the making of the exemption order.
