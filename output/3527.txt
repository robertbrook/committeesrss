[[[Written evidence from the British Medical Association (AMO0003)]]]

[[[About the BMA]]]The BMA is an independent trade union and voluntary professional association which represents doctors and medical students from all branches of medicine throughout the UK. With a membership of over 156,000 worldwide, we promote the medical and allied sciences, seek to maintain the honour and interests of the medical profession and promote the achievement of high quality healthcare.We welcome the opportunity to make a submission to the Health Select Committee in advance of Monitor’s accountability hearing. 

[[[Executive Summary]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Introduction ]]]

[[[1. ]]]Monitor’s new roles and powers have come under close scrutiny since the passage of the Health and Social Care Act 2012 (the Act). The powers that the Act conferred on Monitor gave an exceptionally challenging remit. We recognise the challenges Monitor faces in executing its functions due to the often contradictory legislative framework on which its powers are based. We believe that there is room for improvement in how Monitor interprets many of its powers and functions and consequently how it carries out its statutory functions. 

[[[2. ]]]We look forward to working with Monitor now and in the future. We believe that much more can be done to improve policy development, implementation and guidance over the coming year. We are particularly concerned about Monitor’s interpretation of its role regarding competition. We also have concerns about the shape of the national payment tariff, the enforcement of efficiency savings through the national payment tariff and a lack of clarity for commissioners on procurement and commissioning. This submission gives an overview of the BMA’s principal concerns with Monitor’s role and recent policy decisions, alongside suggestions for how we believe Monitor’s policies can be improved. 

[[[Monitor’s role and performance concerning integration and competition ]]]

[[[3. ]]]We believe that Monitor should provide in-depth guidance for Commissioners concerning its competing roles of promoting integration and preventing anti-competitive behaviour. We believe that integration should be prioritised over preventing anti-competitive behaviour where possible. Therefore, where there is uncertainty in interpreting and implementing the regulations integration should be the default approach. This requires Monitor to develop greater understanding of the potential benefits of integration and develop ways to assess these benefits. We also believe this requires Monitor to recognise the limitations of the current understanding of any potential benefits of competition in healthcare services.

[[[4. ]]]We believe that the description of integrated care within Monitor’s draft procurement, patient choice and competition regulations guidance is helpful. We agree that care is integrated when it is person centred and coordinated. We disagree with the description of competition. We also do not accept Monitor’s assertion that competition and integration are complementary. The two principles are often mutually exclusive. The draft guidance states that competition can give rise to a range of benefits, including improved clinical outcomes and safer health care. It is our view that competition is more likely to give rise to fragmentation of services, unnecessary transaction costs and increased scope for legal challenge. In contrast to the guidance, we believe that this makes it harder for the NHS to deliver high-quality, cost-effective and integrated care to patients. The paragraphs of the draft guidance (pages 17 and 18) are unrelated to the Regulations and seem to reflect a particular view of integration, choice and competition, which chimes with current government policy. This is not appropriate in a guide for commissioners on the application of Regulations. The section on ‘Role of integrated care, competition and choice’ would suffice.

[[[ We remain concerned that Monitor’s interpretation of competition may hamper clinical autonomy, and prevent innovation and integration, and undermine cooperation between commissioners and providers.]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[5. ]]]It would be helpful to include comprehensive examples of circumstances where commissioners can award contracts to a single provider without running a competitive tendering process within Monitor’s finalised guidance. Competitive tendering was an area of great concern during the passage of the Regulations through parliament and it remains the case that the Regulations do not contain explicit wording stating that clinicians will be free to commission services in the way they consider best. It is therefore useful that the draft guidance contains some clarification for commissioners of the types of situations in which they will be able to award a contract without using competition, but greater clarity is needed.

[[[6. ]]]Monitor’s draft guidance for commissioners does not offer sufficient assistance for commissioners concerned about the competing interplay of integration and competition in specific commissioning instances. Clinical Commissioning Groups should be able to promote integration without the fear of being considered anti-competitive and more needs to be done to guide commissioners as to when they can promote integration. We are aware that NHS England is currently working on its guidance to commissioners in this respect. 

[[[It would be helpful if Monitor could provide greater clarity in guidance issued jointly with NHS England for commissioners on the procurement approach. We believe that Monitor should work jointly with NHS England to include within its guidance the importance of integration over that of the prevention of anti-competitive behaviour.]]]

[[[ ]]]&#xa0;

[[[7. ]]]Monitor’s draft guidance states that commissioners may not have to tender where the benefits of tendering would be outweighed by the costs of publishing a contract notice and/or running a competitive tender process. The wording is vague and will leave commissioners open to challenge. It is a commissioner’s duty to procure services within rules set down by European and UK law. The requirement to act proportionately is contained in the Regulations, but there are no details about what ‘proportionality’ means in law. We believe that there is a risk that providers will be able to challenge decisions made by commissioners not to competitively tender for reasons of proportionality using European and domestic competition law, which will hold more weight than Monitor’s guidance. Monitor therefore needs to be exceptionally clear in its guidance to prevent such occurrences. 

[[[It is right that commissioners should be able to contract without competitive tender where the cost would outweigh the benefits, but Monitor needs to be clear where requirements to act proportionately will not be overruled by challenges under competition law. We would welcome greater clarity from Monitor on these issues.]]]

[[[8. ]]]Within primary care there is a consensus emerging that larger groupings of GP practices, such as federations or alliances, are highly desirable if GPs are to cope with increased demand. This will allow them to pool resources and to provide innovative, integrated services. However, GP’s are wary of pursuing such groupings due to concerns that they may be in breach of competition law. The fear that such groupings could be deemed anti-competitive by the Competition Commission is directly hampering innovation. Conglomerations of GPs such as federations and alliances could offer significant quality and efficiency improvements, and potentially make inroads to tackling problems surrounding A&amp;E pressures. We are keen to see that such innovations are not inhibited by the competition regulations. Monitor has raised concerns that primary care groupings could potentially reduce patient choice; this is worrying at a time where primary care is under an historic level of pressure. It is important that choice isn’t pursued as an end in itself; it should not act as a block to innovation, especially during such a time of increased pressures. 

[[[We are concerned that innovative models of primary care will be blocked by Monitor enforcing anti-competitive principles. Innovation in primary care is essential to the future of the NHS. Competition is not an end in itself and should not act as an impediment to progress.]]]

[[[ ]]]               

[[[9. ]]]We are concerned about how competition policy works within the NHS at a time of such unprecedented financial constraint. The NHS is under more pressure than ever to find efficiency savings. These savings are occurring whilst the NHS is facing exceptional demographic pressures which are creating an ever increasing strain on services. The NHS is admirably maintaining and improving quality of care, whilst caring for more and increasingly complex patients, with fewer resources. Bold innovative thinking is needed to address these challenges, clinically led service reconfiguration is central to making large scale savings and improvements in the future. Monitors interpretation of its role is getting in the way of much needed service reconfiguration. The potential merger of Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospitals and Poole Hospital foundation trust which was blocked by the Competition Commission, partly based on the advice from Monitor, raises concerns that competition is interfering with much needed service redesign and reconfiguration. Reconfigurations are sensitive processes, requiring a considerable amount of public consultation; to have these proposals blocked before significant consultation has taken place sets a worrying precedent and contradicts the principles of reconfiguration. 

[[[We believe that Monitor should prioritise the principles of reconfiguration over competition. Monitor should be one of the forefront protectors of patients and clinicians interests in the reconfiguration process. ]]]&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Payments system]]]

[[[10. ]]]The health care reforms did little to address the problem of a lack of integration of services; there is no appetite for further top-down reorganisation of the NHS with the consensus being that further disruptions would be destabilising. Whilst stability is necessary and desirable, it should not act as a barrier to innovation. Collectively we should be moving to a better payments system, focusing on outcomes and improved integration of services. One of the biggest barriers to integration is the current payment by results system. We believe that little progress has been made by Monitor to shape the future of the payments system, and that this is having a negative impact on integration. The current payment by results system can often act as a barrier to integration, creating perverse incentives which lead to silo type thinking and behaviour. Reforming the system to focus better on outcomes and to better encourage integration should be imperative for Monitor. 

[[[We believe that Monitor should move towards creating a payments system better focused on outcomes which encourages integration, both nationally and locally. The BMA would be happy to facilitate discussions to this end.]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[11. ]]]The short-termism of the current efficiency savings enforced through the payment system are preventing longer term, better value efficiency savings from being made. The repeated annual efficiency savings enforced through the tariff ensure that investment projects over longer time-scales are kept to a minimum. The short-term efficiency savings are also encouraging savings from non-recurrent sources such as pay-freezes and redundancies. Monitor in its publication Closing the NHS funding gap stated that such savings are unsustainable. Allowing providers to delay efficiency savings through a multi-year tariff could encourage providers to undertake long-term efficiency savings. A multi-year tariff, tied in with CCG contracts, could provide both stability and encourage innovation from providers. 

[[[We would like to see Monitor looking at efficiency savings over a longer time scale and moving away from unsustainable short-term savings. We believe the short-term savings currently being made are damaging to the NHS. ]]]

[[[The single failure regime and CQC ]]]

[[[12. ]]]The new single failure regime being implemented through the Care Bill will have significant implications for how Monitor works with the CQC in the failure regime. We would welcome updated guidance from Monitor concerning how the implementation of the single failure regime will work with the CQC in practice. At the time of writing, a Government amendment in the House of Lords to the Care Bill will allow the reconfiguration of services in neighbouring Trusts to those who enter the failure regime. The BMA believes that the stringent consultation requirements relating to reconfiguration should be upheld, and we would welcome clarification from Monitor as to how it feels that this amendment, if enacted, would impact on its role within the failure regime. 

[[[Monitor should publish revised guidance, clarifying its own role in the single failure regime, and its relationship within the CQC in the regime. Monitor should also publish guidance on the Care Bill amendment, if enacted. ]]]November 2013
