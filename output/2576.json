"WWC0014&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by Newham College&#xa0;Underachievement in education by white working-class children&#xa0;&#xa0;Introduction and details of submitter&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNewham: a case study&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe role of further education&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe role of HE in FE&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe role of Government&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMake it easier for young people to find out about and enrol for Apprenticeships, particularly by develo\nping a central admissions portal (as with UCAS).\n&#xa0;\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMake it easier for small businesses to take on Apprentices. In the cultural and creative industries, by way of example, 90% of businesses have fewer than ten staff, which makes hiring an Apprentice an \nextreme challenge. As small businesses are often major potential employers in deprived areas such as Newham, this is particularly vital for improving the performance of working class learners.\n&#xa0;\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nImprove the assessment of Apprenticeships’ value, specifically\n by developing a metric similar to that showing the percentage of students attending Russell Group universities or achieving top A level grades.\n&#xa0;\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCease the publication of \nEBac\n statistics with immediate effect, and avoid further policies which denigrate the\n role of vocational learning.\n&#xa0;\ne)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nExplore, and fund, particular programmes which have been valuable in improving the performance of white working-class boys specifically. We would be glad to provide data on which courses this might include in our own borough.\n&#xa0;\nf)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIncentivise the best teachers to work in the most challenging schools. The proposals in the Committee’s 2012 report on teacher quality – particularly those around career structure and performance-related pay – deserve more attention by Government, as the\ny have been proven to work abroad.\n&#xa0;\ng)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRelatedly\n, continue to learn from countries such as Singapore and the US which have developed interesting schemes on teacher recruitment and on improving performance amongst poorer learners.\n&#xa0;\nh)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConsider the scope for ‘fami\nly education programmes’, which could encourage white working-class parents to learn alongside their children in a variety of ways. As many young people resent learning because their parents did, and do not have family support when it comes to furthering t\nheir skills and knowledge, a new policy initiative along these lines could have significant value – and Newham (particular the areas such as Canning Town heavy in white working-class families) could provide a very interesting area for a pilot study.\n&#xa0;\ni)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWithi\nn schools and colleges, encourage teachers to develop mechanisms for dispersing the learning efforts of high-performing groups (such as Chinese girls) to weaker groups (such as white working-class boys), and to finding other ways (such as functional method\nologies for teaching literacy and numeracy) of making core learning engaging to poorer students.\n&#xa0;\nj)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBetter disseminate good practice: it is difficult to find, online, serious case studies of tackling working-class white underperformance, although Ofsted and \nothers have some useful data and publications.\n&#xa0;\nk)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nImprove careers guidance services, and reverse a number of the changes made by the current administration (we would be happy to provide details on which), as these are particularly valuable for poorer student\ns who, for example, might not have easy internet access at home.\n&#xa0;\nWe hope these recommendations are of some interest to the Committee as it pursues this interesting and important line of inquiry. As a leading college in this and other arenas, we would be delighted to contribute further to the inquiry, including by providing oral evidence. &#xa0;September 2013\n See coverage at \nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/white-workingclass-boys-are-an-educational\n-underclass-thinktank-warns-8795495.html\n and full report at \nwww.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk\n \n \nhttp://www.newha\nm.info/research/CFProfiles/CustomHouseCanningTown.pdf\n Ibid.\n \nhttp://www.newham.info/profiles/profile?profileId=138&amp;geoTypeId=6&amp;geoIds=0\n0BB#iasProfileSection8\n.
