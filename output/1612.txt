&#xa0;Written evidence from four rural parish bus surveys in the Hexham /North Tyne valley area of West Northumberland (TIC 063)Introduction and summary The evidence presented relates to scheduled pubic bus services and therefore omits the Committee’s points 4 and 5 as these concern community transport, taxis and demand responsive services outside the scope of the four parish surveys.Hexham is the principal market town in West Northumberland and serves a large sparsely populated rural hinterland. Hexham itself has good bus and rail links to Newcastle, Gateshead and Carlisle but the smaller towns and villages which Hexham serves depend on supported bus services and community transport. Because of the long distances involved the cost per passenger is relatively high, communities which Hexham serves include Kielder 38 miles, Bellingham 18 miles, and Allendale 11 miles.  The County Council is currently reviewing the support it provides for bus services to these communities and it is unlikely that current levels of support can be maintained in 2014 and thereafter. Any reduction in bus services will add to car dependency and adversely affect the quality of life and access to essential services for people living in the rural communities served by Hexham. 1. How do government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities? Demand is identified by the local authority through collection of on bus data recording . This approach has serious limitations because no account can be taken of 

[[[potential]]] demand. A series of surveys have been conducted by four rural parish councils in the Hexham area (along the North Tyne valley) during  2012 and 2013 to assess potential demand for public transport as well as asking existing users why they choose to use the bus. Since the railway serving this area closed in 1956 (Hexham to Hawick) buses are the only public transport available. The four parish surveys, which were distributed to every home and returned by over 340 households, showed that the main reasons that people did not use the bus were:(a) they did not know when the bus ran (poor publicity and lack of timetables) (b) the bus did not go where they wanted to go (e.g. local supermarkets and health centres)  (c) buses were unreliable and irregular. Those opting to use the bus did so (a) because they did not have access to a car (b) because its better for the environmentThe majority of bus users in the village communities surveyed are aged over 60 and around half have no access to a car. Most of those who do have a car and choose to use the bus do so for environmental reasons.   Northumberland County Council is using the information collected in these parish surveys to help in its financial review of the bus services which it supports. If the key issues of information, routes and regularity can be addressed bus usage will increase. In fact operators have already noticed an increase in passenger numbers since the surveys were conducted. Plans for supported services from 2014 onwards currently being finalised by Northumberland County Council and should result in a more regular timetables and amended routes to include Hexham’s supermarkets. Higher passenger numbers should help to make the services more economically viable. However the County Council is having to make cuts to its supported bus services budget while at the same time operators costs are rising (and they are having to absorb the 20% reduction in the BOSG). The result is almost certain to be a reduction in the services provided to this very rural area leading to (a) more car dependence and (b) more, mostly older people, becoming isolated. (c) reduced access to the countryside for people living in Hexham itself. These are issues which concern Hexham as a traditional market town serving a large rural hinterland. &#xa0;2. To what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities? (a) 

[[[People with d]]]

[[[isabilities]]] 

[[[and young children’s needs]]] Contracts for supported bus services require operators to use accessible (low floor) vehicles however in the four parish surveys about 33% of respondents gave concern about being able to board the bus as a reason for not using the bus. This is an issue which affects people with disabilities (mostly older people) and parents with young children in pushchairs (both groups of people who are very likely to need to use the bus). Although operators are required to provide low floor buses the experience of those responding to the parish surveys is that unsuitable buses are frequently substituted. This undermines confidence in the service. 

[[[(b) ]]]

[[[Medical needs]]]: amongst the parish survey respondents the second most frequently cited reason for using the bus (after going shopping) was to attend medical appointments. Older people who make up the bulk of rural bus passengers have high non emergency medical needs. For the 50% without access to a car their continuing independence may depend on being able to use the bus to get to GP and dental practices and hospital appointments in Hexham. Lack of public transport can lead therefore to premature transfer to a care home.3. What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent services to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome?

[[[(a)]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[Stimulating demand]]]: the parish surveys referred to above suggest that a key challenge is to identify and capitalise on 

[[[potential]]] demand rather than relying wholly on actual bus usage data. How to overcome this challenge?To release this latent demand and thus increase passenger numbers existing rural bus services need (1) to be actively promoted using route branding techniques and widely distributed timetables. This should form part of the contract for any service receiving public support, marketing should also focus on the environmental benefits of using public transport (just as re-cycling is promoted bu most local authorities) (2) to be regular and reliable departing at fixed intervals.(3) to be routed to serve key locations including supermarkets and health centres(4) to use only low access buses (with no substitution ‘loop holes’ in the contract.(5) to ensure that timetables, once in place, are maintained for as long as possible. 

[[[(b) ]]]

[[[Travel to work]]]: The parish surveys indicated that a small but significant number of people from as far away as Bellingham use the bus to get to their place of work. These journeys tend to be in the early morning and in the evening, times when use by other passengers is low. Consequently it is these journeys which are seen as being the least ‘economic’ but most in need of support. How to overcome this challenge?Use of a demand responsive service dedicated to this group of users and employing a small vehicle (e.g. 12 or 16 seat) might be appropriate especially as it could be tailored to user’s needs in terms of pick up and connections to onward bus and train services from Hexham to Tyneside. 4.

[[[(]]]

[[[a]]]

[[[) High costs related to long distances with low population density: ]]]the rural areas which Hexham serves are sparsely populated and served by buses which, in the case of the Hexham to Kielder route involve a 2hr 50minute round trip timetable with no stopover. Evaluation of the cost of supported services should have an adjustment formula to disregard the impact of distance in sparsely populated areas otherwise these long routes will always be at a disadvantage when cost per passenger is assessed.

[[[cost per passenger]]]

[[[ by increasing passenger numbers]]]

[[[: ]]]based on the four parish surveys there is potential to considerably increase the usage of existing services and thereby reduce the cost per passenger. Additional fares would reduce the level of public support required. 

[[[(c) Encourage isolated communities to trial a volunteer driven public scheduled bus service: ]]]this approach has been successfully piloted by

[[[ ]]]Hedgehog Bus, the North Cotswold Community Bus Association http://hedgehogbus.org/

[[[(d) Seek additional sources of funding for scheduled services including:]]]- Parish and Town Council contributions - voluntary contributions from bus users entitled to concessionary fares- subsidies from supermarkets.

[[[(e) ]]]

[[[Calculate overall cost / benefits when looking at ‘affordability ]]]- the additional environmental cost of increased car use arising from discontinuation of bus services- the additional cost of dedicated transport for people needing to access medical services- the loss of local bus industry employment arising from discontinuation of bus services - the impact on new housing planning permissions of villages becoming inaccessible by public transport and therefore ineligible for housing expansion. - the loss of business to market towns like Hexham arising from discontinuation of bus services. Bus routes focus on Hexham while car dependence expands travelling distances and accelerates use of out of town shopping centres such as the Gateshead Metrocentre.  September 2013&#xa0; Parish Council surveys of bus use were conducted during 2012 / 2013 in the parishes of Acomb, Humshaugh, and Chollerton and in the Bellingham / Kielder area.
