[[[The Consortium of Expert Witnesses to the Family Courts]]]

[[[ (LAI 0081)]]]&#xa0;I write on behalf of the nearly 600 members of the Consortium of Expert Witnesses to the Family Courts. Our members comprise expert clinicians from a variety of disciplines that report to the Family Courts, including paediatrics, adult and child psychiatry, psychology, and independent social work. We provide professional input regarding non-accidental injuries, mental health issues within families, and child development. &#xa0;Although you have raised particular issues about the Governmentâ€™s proposals to restrict legal aid, please consider the human rights issues that currently are affecting children and families who are before the Family Courts. &#xa0;&#xa0;This input to the Courts has largely disappeared for the families who need public support and no longer have it. &#xa0;&#xa0;What is being lost is the clinical expertise and experience of senior professionals who have contributed to the working of the Family Courts for many years. Medical specialists help the Courts to identify non-accidental injuries, sometimes when they are not suspected. They help the Courts to identify cases where non-accidental injuries are wrongly suspected. When mental health clinicians identify treatable problems, families can be helped to remain together, reducing the risk of poor outcomes for a child growing up in care and the financial cost to society. Conversely, prompt mental health assessments can identify poor prognosis and high levels of risk, reducing delay for the child and reducing cost by assisting the Court in speedy resolution of these cases.&#xa0;The real victims are the children and their families who are the subjects of Family Court proceedings. They will not have the benefit of expert clinical input to the Courts when decisions are made about their future. Decisions made without relevant and accurate evidence risk justice being undermined for children and families who cannot afford to pay privately. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;I am available to discuss these matters further with you or to give evidence in person, if you wish. &#xa0;27 September 20131&#xa0;
