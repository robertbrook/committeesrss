[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In its Terms of Reference for this inquiry, the Committee makes reference to the ‘industry’ involved in the provision of helicopter flights in the UK North Sea. This industry includes helicopter manufacturers, helicopter operators and the energy companies whose staff and contractors travel between the mainland and offshore installations. The industry works together on safety. This submission represents the collective views of the industry’s three main helicopter operators:
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Worldwide
[normal], combined
[normal], the three operators employ 
[normal]over 10,000 people
[normal]. In 2012, they carried
[normal] around 3 million 
[normal]passengers using a fleet of 
[normal]nearly 1,000
[normal] helicopters. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In the UK, the operators together employ 
[normal]almost 2,000 
[normal]people. 
[normal]In 2012, they carried over half a million 
[normal]passengers to installations in the North Sea 
[normal]with a combined 
[normal]UK fleet of over 80 helicopters. Over the period from 1981 to 2010, there were almost 3 million flight hours in the UK Continental Shelf sector of the North Sea with over 54 million passengers carried. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As operators, 
[normal]it is 
[normal]our duty above all else is to provide the safest possible operating environment for our crews and passengers. All three operators are dedicated to safety – not only independently, as commercial organisations driving quality 
[normal]and safety 
[normal]for our customers through innovation, but also increasingly in collaboration. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Notwithstanding our collective commitment to safety, the North Sea oil and gas industry operates in a challenging environment and there are many inherent risks. 
[normal] 
[normal]Aberdeen is home to the largest helicopter operation in the world and is considered one of the safest. A recent study commissioned by the UK Offshore Oil and Gas Industry Association Limited
[normal] found that for the period from 1995 to 2010, the safety record of helicopter operations in the UK Continental Shelf compared favourably with other operations in the North Sea and those elsewhere in the world. The following table compares the global fatal and non-fatal accident rates of UK Continental Shelf helicopter operations from 1995 to 2010 with all North Sea and worldwide operations, based on 100,000 flying hours.

[normal]*99% of UK oil and gas production occurs under the seas surrounding the UK, from the seabed known as the UK continental shelf (UKCS).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Since 2010
[normal], the end-
[normal]point of this study, there 
[normal]has 
[normal]been three 
[normal]accidents
[normal] in the UK North Sea. 
[normal]Two of the accidents were controlled landings on water and 
[normal]all passengers and crew returned safely to shore. The third, on 23 August 2013, resulted in the tragic deaths of four of the 18 people on board. The Air Accident Investigation Branch is continuing to investigate 
[normal]to establish 
[normal]the full facts surrounding this tragic accident.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Rotary aviation is a highly regulated sector. All operations are overseen by the UK Civil Aviation Authority (UK CAA). Each operator holds an Air Operator Certificate (AOC) issued by the UK CAA. To secure an AOC, operators go through rigorous scrutiny and audits of their procedures, people, assets, and systems. We also provide evidence of how we prioritise the safety of our people and passengers above all else. This certificate approves the operators to provide commercial passenger flights for the oil and gas industry.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In addition, airworthiness is underpinned by strict compliance procedures laid down by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The Agency promotes common standards of safety and environmental protection in Europe and worldwide. It provides for a single European market in the aviation industry. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As well as the UK CAA and EASA regulations, operators are 
[normal]obliged to comply with OGP standards for helicopter operations. We are also 
[normal]subject to the contractual requirements of our customers, which often include customer-specific aviation standards (e.g. a minimum number of flight hours before a pilot can fly offshore). Although most standards are routinely met by all operators, there can be significant 
[normal]additional 
[normal]variations. An operator with 10 clients, for example, might be expected to operate flights to 10 different standards. And, as each customer company has its own standard, each must conduct its own audits. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]None of these additional customer requirements individually erode safety
[normal], nor do they 
[normal]conflict with regulations, but as a whole they introduce 
[normal]complexities 
[normal]to an operator’s Operations Manual. 
[normal]Potential areas for improvement include a move to a single set of high standards and more common audit processes.
[normal] A 
[normal]more joined-up approach would improve clarity and reduce complexity.  The UK CAA is centrally positioned to be able to help drive this effort.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Another example of where the UK CAA could contribute to driving standards further still
[normal] is through the already valued
[normal] work of its Helicopter Safety Research Management Committee, 
[normal]the profile and scope of which could be increased
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Safety starts in our own procurement of aircraft; we expect safety excellence and innovation from helicopter manufacturers. The North Sea is served by a mixed fleet including AgustaWestland, Eurocopter, 
[normal]and 
[normal]Sikorsky.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Each operator manages operational safety using integrated Safety Management Systems (SMS). In 2012, a regulatory requirement to have an SMS was introduced in the UK although we had implemented SMS long before the requirement was introduced.  The SMS 
[normal]is 
[normal]used to manage Safety Policy, Safety Risk Management, Safety Assurance and Safety Promotion.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Each operator also employs Safety and Quality teams 
[normal]to 
[normal]develop and implement comprehensive internal quality
[normal] and safety programmes agreed by the UK CAA. 
[normal]Our operations are overseen by the CAA through processes including approval of operating and maintenance manuals
[normal] and 
[normal]internal audit programmes.  The CAA also participates in our monthly safety review boards.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Over the years, many technological developments, which began at the initiative of one operator, have been shared with other operators and adopted by the wider industry. Examples of such technological enhancements are set out below:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ensuring safety is not just about reducing technical risks. 
[normal]The managing of h
[normal]uman factors play
[normal]s
[normal] an important role in aviation 
[normal]safety
[normal]. Training of crews and pilots is critical to our approach to safety, especially as the aircraft used are increasingly more complex. Flight crew simulators are now routinely used and these are increasingly sophisticated and able to replicate the characteristics of the aircraft we use, as well as different weather conditions and approaches. There are three simulator training locations in Aberdeen. Training packages are approved by the relevant authorities and include packages which replicate the flying conditions for both routine operations and emergency procedures.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Operators also use mandatory Crew Resource Management training programmes designed to 
[normal]promote positive 
[normal]crew behaviour and improve performance in the cockpit.  This training includes situational awareness, decision making, threat and error management and crew cooperation. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Innovation has helped 
[normal]to improve quality and safety standards, raising the 
[normal]bar 
[normal]on what is possible and what has already been achieved
[normal], whilst collaboration through various industry bodies and initiatives has encouraged the benefits of safety improvements to be shared.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Through a number of 
[normal]forums
[normal], operators engage with each other and with the industry. These include
[normal], but are not limited to
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]5.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In September 2013, 
[normal]in addition to the above forums
[normal], the main operators established a Joint Operators Review (JOR) Working Group to further share best practice, to identify any changes that we can make, and to drive improvements in a coordinated way. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This Group was
[normal] set up by, involves, and reports to 
[normal]the CEOs of the three 
[normal]main operators of helicopter services in the North Sea
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]he JOR 
[normal]is 
[normal]to become the principal vehicle for safety improvement cooperation. Its mission is “to review current processes, procedures and equipment in order to identify best practice in the offshore helicopter industry with a view to further enhancing safety”. 
[normal]5.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The areas of focus for the JOR, as stated in a terms of reference letter signed by the CEOs of the three operators, are:
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Once the first tranche of prioritised work is complete, the JOR Working Group will 
[normal]review progress and 
[normal]consider the benefits of increasing further 
[normal]its 
[normal]engagement with OEMs, oil and gas customers, regulators and others so that together we 
[normal]can 
[normal]continue to 
[normal]further 
[normal]raise 
[normal]safety 
[normal]standards
[normal] in our operations.
