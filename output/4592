default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn its Terms of Reference for this inquiry, the Committee makes reference to the ‘industry’ involved in the provision of helicopter flights in the UK North Sea. This industry includes helicopter manufacturers, helicopter operators and the energy companies whose staff and contractors travel between the mainland and offshore installations. The industry works together on safety. This submission represents the collective views of the industry’s three main helicopter operators:

defaultWorldwide
default, combined
default, the three operators employ 
defaultover 10,000 people
default. In 2012, they carried
default around 3 million 
defaultpassengers using a fleet of 
defaultnearly 1,000
default helicopters. 
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn the UK, the operators together employ 
defaultalmost 2,000 
defaultpeople. 
defaultIn 2012, they carried over half a million 
defaultpassengers to installations in the North Sea 
defaultwith a combined 
defaultUK fleet of over 80 helicopters. Over the period from 1981 to 2010, there were almost 3 million flight hours in the UK Continental Shelf sector of the North Sea with over 54 million passengers carried. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default2.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs operators, 
defaultit is 
defaultour duty above all else is to provide the safest possible operating environment for our crews and passengers. All three operators are dedicated to safety – not only independently, as commercial organisations driving quality 
defaultand safety 
defaultfor our customers through innovation, but also increasingly in collaboration. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNotwithstanding our collective commitment to safety, the North Sea oil and gas industry operates in a challenging environment and there are many inherent risks. 
default 
defaultAberdeen is home to the largest helicopter operation in the world and is considered one of the safest. A recent study commissioned by the UK Offshore Oil and Gas Industry Association Limited
default found that for the period from 1995 to 2010, the safety record of helicopter operations in the UK Continental Shelf compared favourably with other operations in the North Sea and those elsewhere in the world. The following table compares the global fatal and non-fatal accident rates of UK Continental Shelf helicopter operations from 1995 to 2010 with all North Sea and worldwide operations, based on 100,000 flying hours.

default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSince 2010
default, the end-
defaultpoint of this study, there 
defaulthas 
defaultbeen three 
defaultaccidents
default in the UK North Sea. 
defaultTwo of the accidents were controlled landings on water and 
defaultall passengers and crew returned safely to shore. The third, on 23 August 2013, resulted in the tragic deaths of four of the 18 people on board. The Air Accident Investigation Branch is continuing to investigate 
defaultto establish 
defaultthe full facts surrounding this tragic accident.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default3.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRotary aviation is a highly regulated sector. All operations are overseen by the UK Civil Aviation Authority (UK CAA). Each operator holds an Air Operator Certificate (AOC) issued by the UK CAA. To secure an AOC, operators go through rigorous scrutiny and audits of their procedures, people, assets, and systems. We also provide evidence of how we prioritise the safety of our people and passengers above all else. This certificate approves the operators to provide commercial passenger flights for the oil and gas industry.
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn addition, airworthiness is underpinned by strict compliance procedures laid down by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The Agency promotes common standards of safety and environmental protection in Europe and worldwide. It provides for a single European market in the aviation industry. 
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs well as the UK CAA and EASA regulations, operators are 
defaultobliged to comply with OGP standards for helicopter operations. We are also 
defaultsubject to the contractual requirements of our customers, which often include customer-specific aviation standards (e.g. a minimum number of flight hours before a pilot can fly offshore). Although most standards are routinely met by all operators, there can be significant 
defaultadditional 
defaultvariations. An operator with 10 clients, for example, might be expected to operate flights to 10 different standards. And, as each customer company has its own standard, each must conduct its own audits. 
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNone of these additional customer requirements individually erode safety
default, nor do they 
defaultconflict with regulations, but as a whole they introduce 
defaultcomplexities 
defaultto an operator’s Operations Manual. 
defaultPotential areas for improvement include a move to a single set of high standards and more common audit processes.
default A 
defaultmore joined-up approach would improve clarity and reduce complexity.  The UK CAA is centrally positioned to be able to help drive this effort.
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAnother example of where the UK CAA could contribute to driving standards further still
default is through the already valued
default work of its Helicopter Safety Research Management Committee, 
defaultthe profile and scope of which could be increased
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default4.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSafety starts in our own procurement of aircraft; we expect safety excellence and innovation from helicopter manufacturers. The North Sea is served by a mixed fleet including AgustaWestland, Eurocopter, 
defaultand 
defaultSikorsky.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEach operator manages operational safety using integrated Safety Management Systems (SMS). In 2012, a regulatory requirement to have an SMS was introduced in the UK although we had implemented SMS long before the requirement was introduced.  The SMS 
defaultis 
defaultused to manage Safety Policy, Safety Risk Management, Safety Assurance and Safety Promotion.
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEach operator also employs Safety and Quality teams 
defaultto 
defaultdevelop and implement comprehensive internal quality
default and safety programmes agreed by the UK CAA. 
defaultOur operations are overseen by the CAA through processes including approval of operating and maintenance manuals
default and 
defaultinternal audit programmes.  The CAA also participates in our monthly safety review boards.
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOver the years, many technological developments, which began at the initiative of one operator, have been shared with other operators and adopted by the wider industry. Examples of such technological enhancements are set out below:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default4.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEnsuring safety is not just about reducing technical risks. 
defaultThe managing of h
defaultuman factors play
defaults
default an important role in aviation 
defaultsafety
default. Training of crews and pilots is critical to our approach to safety, especially as the aircraft used are increasingly more complex. Flight crew simulators are now routinely used and these are increasingly sophisticated and able to replicate the characteristics of the aircraft we use, as well as different weather conditions and approaches. There are three simulator training locations in Aberdeen. Training packages are approved by the relevant authorities and include packages which replicate the flying conditions for both routine operations and emergency procedures.
default&#xa0;default4.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOperators also use mandatory Crew Resource Management training programmes designed to 
defaultpromote positive 
defaultcrew behaviour and improve performance in the cockpit.  This training includes situational awareness, decision making, threat and error management and crew cooperation. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default5.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultInnovation has helped 
defaultto improve quality and safety standards, raising the 
defaultbar 
defaulton what is possible and what has already been achieved
default, whilst collaboration through various industry bodies and initiatives has encouraged the benefits of safety improvements to be shared.
default&#xa0;default5.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThrough a number of 
defaultforums
default, operators engage with each other and with the industry. These include
default, but are not limited to
default:
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default5.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn September 2013, 
defaultin addition to the above forums
default, the main operators established a Joint Operators Review (JOR) Working Group to further share best practice, to identify any changes that we can make, and to drive improvements in a coordinated way. 
default&#xa0;
default5.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis Group was
default set up by, involves, and reports to 
defaultthe CEOs of the three 
defaultmain operators of helicopter services in the North Sea
default. 
defaultT
defaulthe JOR 
defaultis 
defaultto become the principal vehicle for safety improvement cooperation. Its mission is “to review current processes, procedures and equipment in order to identify best practice in the offshore helicopter industry with a view to further enhancing safety”. 
default5.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe areas of focus for the JOR, as stated in a terms of reference letter signed by the CEOs of the three operators, are:
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default5.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOnce the first tranche of prioritised work is complete, the JOR Working Group will 
defaultreview progress and 
defaultconsider the benefits of increasing further 
defaultits 
defaultengagement with OEMs, oil and gas customers, regulators and others so that together we 
defaultcan 
defaultcontinue to 
defaultfurther 
defaultraise 
defaultsafety 
defaultstandards
default in our operations.
