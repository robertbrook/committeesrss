[[[Introduction]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The Local Government Association (LGA) is the national voice of local government.  We work with councils to support, promote and improve local government.&#xa0;We are a politically-led, cross party organisation which works on behalf of councils to ensure local government has a strong, credible voice with national government.  We aim to influence and set the political agenda on the issues that matter to councils so they are able to deliver local solutions to national problems.  &#xa0;The LGA covers every part of England and Wales, supporting local government as the most efficient and accountable part of the public sector.
