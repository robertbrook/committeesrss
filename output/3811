defaultChichester
default is a small city with lots of 
defaultgyratories
default and large roundabouts put in the last century and with the increase of traffic, these junctions are ver
defaulty scary and off-putting to
default even
default seasoned cyclists.  You 
defaultliterally 
defaulttake your life in your hands when you cycle around our city.
default&#xa0;
defaultChichester
default’s cycling infrastructure has not been improved
default/maintained
default since we started our campaign in 2010.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are plans to improve 2 of the junctions
default with LSTF monies but progress is very slow
default and the proposals adopted have not been approved by the Cycling Embassy of GB or the Dutch Cycling Embassy
default, or discussed and approved by the local Cycle Forum in their current form
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are no plans to improve
default any of our other junctions, only two of our main roads have any provision for cyclists
default and one of these puts cyclists onto a very narrow pavement which creates conflict between pedestrians and cyclists
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe would propose that proper, segregated cycle rout
defaultes/paths are urgently requ
defaultired on our major arterials
default to improve cycling safety
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe need proper enforcement of our new 20mph limits by the police to make sure our residential streets are safe for cyclists and the new limits are being kept to.
default The police a
defaultre very reluctant to enforce our new limits due to limited resources.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe would also like to draw attention to Network Rail who were remarkably unconcerned when it was pointed out that a bridge, replacing a level crossing, would likely result in cyclists t
defaultaking a fast moving main road which is more dangerous than the crossing they were hoping to close (the bridge is also believed to be 
defaultnondefault compliant with government Local Transport Notes in several respects: notably not catering for mounted cyclists, expecte
defaultd number of users, and over tight bends which fail to properly accommodate tandems and cargo bikes). Therefore when the crossing closes, cyclists will likely be diverted away from NCR 2 onto a fast flowing dual carriageway.
