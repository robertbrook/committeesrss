[normal]Chichester
[normal] is a small city with lots of 
[normal]gyratories
[normal] and large roundabouts put in the last century and with the increase of traffic, these junctions are ver
[normal]y scary and off-putting to
[normal] even
[normal] seasoned cyclists.  You 
[normal]literally 
[normal]take your life in your hands when you cycle around our city.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Chichester
[normal]’s cycling infrastructure has not been improved
[normal]/maintained
[normal] since we started our campaign in 2010.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are plans to improve 2 of the junctions
[normal] with LSTF monies but progress is very slow
[normal] and the proposals adopted have not been approved by the Cycling Embassy of GB or the Dutch Cycling Embassy
[normal], or discussed and approved by the local Cycle Forum in their current form
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are no plans to improve
[normal] any of our other junctions, only two of our main roads have any provision for cyclists
[normal] and one of these puts cyclists onto a very narrow pavement which creates conflict between pedestrians and cyclists
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We would propose that proper, segregated cycle rout
[normal]es/paths are urgently requ
[normal]ired on our major arterials
[normal] to improve cycling safety
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We need proper enforcement of our new 20mph limits by the police to make sure our residential streets are safe for cyclists and the new limits are being kept to.
[normal] The police a
[normal]re very reluctant to enforce our new limits due to limited resources.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We would also like to draw attention to Network Rail who were remarkably unconcerned when it was pointed out that a bridge, replacing a level crossing, would likely result in cyclists t
[normal]aking a fast moving main road which is more dangerous than the crossing they were hoping to close (the bridge is also believed to be 
[normal]non[bold] compliant with government Local Transport Notes in several respects: notably not catering for mounted cyclists, expecte
[normal]d number of users, and over tight bends which fail to properly accommodate tandems and cargo bikes). Therefore when the crossing closes, cyclists will likely be diverted away from NCR 2 onto a fast flowing dual carriageway.
