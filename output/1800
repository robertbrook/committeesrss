defaultComments as per bullet points.
defaultStatistics are c
defaultollected by DCC (Devon County Council) as to Community Transport usage. These are used in the 
defaultCounty
default 
defaultTransport
default plan. Local councils lobby County with specific issues. Local travel companies survey users as to local destination and ultimate destination. The
default statistics from the local council 
defaultadhoc
default survey with the private volunteer railway company operating the Dartmoor line (
defaultOkehampton
default to Exeter –Sundays only) were sent to DCC  as DCC has plans to extend the railway network with new branch lines. The 
defaultTarka
default (B
defaultarnstaple) and Avocet (Exmouth) have proved extremely popular not only with tourists but also with locals for work and shopping trips. We are working towards this daily service operating from 
defaultOkehampton
default. 
default            Who pays the cost of these surveys? Com
defaultmunity transport was asked to complete a survey of shop/spend statistics but no idea who collated the responses or what they were used for.
default              Census information is used to predict transport needs such as 
defaultBus
default 
defaultPass
default numbers and school transport bu
defaultt not to estimate public transport requirements.
default NB.       Statistics are collected from passengers..however...
defaultthe isolated rural population with no access to transport are not included in these surveys!default2.
default              
defaultTo what extent are the needs of different groups
default of passengers (
defaulteg
default people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?
defaultCommunity Transport reports that people with medical appointments can be sent around the c
defaultounty and beyond..to hospitals from 
defaultOkehampton
default to 
defaultTorbay
default, 
defaultExeter
default, 
defaultBarnstaple
default or 
defaultFrenchay
default in 
defaultBristol.Taxis
default would be prohibitively expensive and so Community Transport cars are used for these trips. This means that social users 
defaultie
default. elderly ladies going to th
defaulte hairdressers or people attending RVS Lunch Clubs cannot be assisted adequately and consequently there is a rise in social exclusion for the rural elderly.
defaultInadequate public transport for young people going to College and back can deter them from attendin
defaultg. We have heard of young people being left stranded and having to ask for lifts. 
defaultPrivate transport companies have to be financially viable, rail franchisees have shareholders who expect dividends, so it is very much a case of Commerce first and Community
default last! Very 
defaultrural hamlets not on main roads become increasingly inaccessible to any but car owners. This is partially why 2
defaultnd
default home owners have added to the depopulation 
defaultof villages
default and make public 
defaulttransport even
default more 
defaultunviable
default.
defaultThe working day is not 9-5 fo
defaultr all workers, many factories etc, work 24 hour shifts. Anyone commuting to 
defaultExeter
default needs personal transport. Even car sharing has problems in the case of illness/shift patterns but are still better than waiting 2 hours for a bus! Workers have their benefit
default taken away if they refuse a placement yet 
defaultPlymouth
default is not directly accessible by public transport from 
defaultOkehampton
default.
defaultIn some countries, school buses are also available for community usage. The Highlands and Islands has a Post Bus service combining postal de
defaultlivery with passenger transport, seats booked by telephone and return time by negotiation.  In this country legislation mitigates against flexibility of transport. There is no integration of services. In cities one can buy a ticket for a metro-bus combinat
defaultion. But in rural areas we cannot even go into the city by one bus service and home by the competitor. Competing companies should be integrating services not making life even more difficult for the rural traveller. Especially when services can be hours apa
defaultrt.  The fragmentation of services is not conducive to either work or social journeys. The students from rural areas travelling into 
defaultExeter
default by bus, cannot travel directly into 
defaultPlymouth
default and get home again. There is a new 
defaultlate
default night bus to and from 
defaultExeter
default wh
defaultich comes out via the villages but returns to 
defaultExeter
default via the A30 and bypasses the villages...so for example, they can get into 
defaultOkehampton
default for the cinema, but cannot get home again! The social circle is wide in rural areas because of the population paucity,
default kids make friends at school and college but cannot visit each other unless parents provide transport. Social isolation is a deprivation not only for the elderly.

default              
defaultWhat are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and 
defaultrail services to isolated communities?  How can these challenges be overcome?
defaultThe main challenges are due to market forces and the problems of funding Community Interest companies. Again..we need joined up services..in 
defaultSpain
default you can order a computerized ti
defaultcket for cross transport travel. Perhaps the cities (Transport for London, Newcastle and Merseyside Metro) should subsidise rural services? The over 60’s in London get not only free bus passes (as do schoolchildren) but also free Tube fare. Our rural elder
defaultly get a free bus pass but some cannot access a bus to use it on.. and children over 16 now have to pay a fee for school transport for sixth form/college. This has a seriously detrimental effect on poor rural families. Rural transport is paid for by local 
defaulttaxes so with a small population the costs are exponentially higher.
defaultSecond home buyers give the impression rural areas are wealthy but the per capita income of people living and working in rural areas is considerably lower. The high cost of fuel increases
default the living costs of the rural poor. The 5p reduction in fuel costs was only for the far north and island communities. Perhaps the 1 ½ m cost of this should be used to increase rural county transport systems throughout the country.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe should aim to reduce road congestion by implementing Transport Hubs....
defaultOkehampton
default, 
defaultTavistock
default, 
defaultBarnstaple
default, 
defaultBude
default. The new rail link from 
defaultBude
default to 
defaultBarnstaple
default has proved there is a need for this service and it is increasingly used both by tourists and locals
default. Buses could pick up from villages to take people to the nearest Hub station. The Sunday Dartmoor Rover ticket proved this system worked but it needs to be a daily service. The service was subsidized by DCC and has now been cut as part of the general fund
defaulting cuts suffered by local authorities. This works well in the cities and needs to be replicated in the country, integrated (or nationalised) transport systems are the answer.

defaultHow effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passenge
defaultrs in isolated communities?  How could Community Transport be improved?
defaultWith reference to Community Transport, DCC set the routes. With the changes in benefits, fewer people qualify and young families are reluctant to use it as it is seen as a service for 
defaultthe elderly and not ‘cool’. Community cars are used mainly for access to health care. We do have to be careful, this service relies on volunteer drivers and we cannot expect volunteers to fulfil all the population needs. Community cars cannot be used to co
defaultllect people from hamlets to nearest bus stop as there is no guarantee the bus will run. People would be left stranded (and in fact, are,) when buses break down or are caught up in traffic jams (accidents closing the A30 etc. are common in summer). Buses s
defaulthould have radio contact so replacement buses can be sent out in these events. In cities, the bus stops have a message system (e.g.  – next bus in 5 minutes) whereas in the country you can stand for over an hour with no knowledge of where and when the bus 
defaultis finally arriving. This is extremely stressful if one has a train or 
defaultplane to
default catch.
default5.
default              
defaultTo what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?
defaultThe rural poor cannot afford tax
defaultis unless they are able to coordinate a group to travel! Edge of town people use taxis for big shopping expeditions, say, once a week. The Town bus which runs out to the peripheral estates ceases running shortly after 5pm so no use to people who work. It h
defaultas been said that the driver will not wait at stops but if there is no-one there, he continues on his way so the timetable cannot be trusted, which is difficult for as the passengers don’t know if he has passed by or not! Horrendous, if you live in a villa
defaultge and cannot get home - Especially if you live alone and have no family to taxi you or you are a young teenager at risk of passing ‘helpful strangers’. The safety aspect of old and young having to walk miles down dark lanes. The DCC Fair Car Scheme subsid
defaultizing taxis worked well in really rural areas but again, the funding was axed.

default              
defaultWhat are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities?  How can these services be made more affordable?
defaultThe main challenges are fund
defaulting and understanding the realities of rural life. New services take time to build support as people realise they are available and can be trusted to run. Maybe rural transport should be run purely as a community service and not for profit. Maybe a franchi
defaultsee should be set a service-providing contract with public funding to cover 
defaultcosts with a built in ‘cushion’ for repairs/replacement. Like trains, maybe bus companies should face penalty clauses for poor service?
defaultFuel tax reduced for public transport ..the 
defaultBus Service Operator Grant has been cut. Insurance costs are too high and maybe should be looked at nationally. There is no holistic system..and maybe there should be?
defaultFinally...scrap the HS2 and put that money into Rural Transport Hubs and enable integrat
defaulted Transport Systems.
