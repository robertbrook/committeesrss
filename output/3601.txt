[[[Professor Martyn Sloman]]], Visiting Professor of Management, Kingston Business School, and 

[[[Dr Paul Copeland]]], Lecturer in Public Policy, Queen Mary, University of London&#xa0;

[[[Q15 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[The Chairman:]]] All three of you are very welcome. Before I engage with the witnesses, I want to make a few points. The Members of the Committee with relevant interests will declare these now. Does anybody have a relevant interest? We always seem to skirt over this one. I take it that they have not. The session is on record and is being webcast live and will be subsequently accessible via the parliamentary website. The witnesses will receive a transcript of the session to check and correct and this will be put on the public record in printed form and on the parliamentary website. For the record, would each of the witnesses begin by stating their names and official titles?

[[[Professor Maguire]]]: My name is Sue Maguire. I am a professorial fellow at the Centre for Education and Industry at the University of Warwick.

[[[Professor Sloman]]]: My name is Martyn Sloman. I am a visiting professor at Kingston University and an extraordinary professor at North-West University, South Africa.

[[[Dr Copeland]]]: My name is Paul Copeland and I am lecturer of public policy at Queen Mary in London.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Thank you very much. Does anybody want to make an opening statement before we go into the questions? Lord Brooke, you have the first question.

[[[Q16 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] Welcome. Good afternoon and thank you for the written evidence that we have had, which is interesting. One of the problems that I have in trying to get to the heart of this issue is the terminology in the field of unemployment, which to an outsider can be somewhat ambiguous. What do you think is meant by youth unemployment as opposed to worklessness and the other category of NEET that is increasingly used throughout the whole of Europe as well as the UK? For example, if a young person has left school with no job and is then put by a government programme on to a short-term training scheme, where do they crop up in these figures? What are the real figures and how do we get a better understanding about the real unemployed?

[[[Professor Maguire]]]: You have picked up on a very key issue. If we are famous for anything in Britain, we are famous for defining the term NEET. We created the term and it was created in the late 1990s following concern about the growing number of young people whose destination was unknown. Prior to 1988, all young people in England were eligible for income support or unemployment benefit when they left school. That was terminated in 1988, so 16 to 18 year-olds were no longer classified as unemployed. The only group of young unemployed that we had were the post-18 group and they were young people who were claiming benefit and actively seeking work. We had this group of young people who were operating under the radar and who had no official connection to any agency. Towards the end of the 1990s there was growing concern about this unknown group and who they were and, more critically, how many there were. Their official status was zero in the unemployment camp because they were not classified as unemployed. So we coined the term NEET—not in education, employment or training—to get a handle on this population of under-18s who were not participating in education, employment or training. The distinction is very much, in my mind, that the under-18s were NEET and the over-18s were those who could claim benefit and were actively seeking work. Those two definitions have become rather blurred and the NEET definition is used now more widely to incorporate both young people who are actively seeking work, the unemployed, and the non-active group, the NEET group. Within that NEET group, we now have over a million young people in England. We have these strange definitions and terms, but if we want a classification of just unemployed, they are the young people who are actively seeking work and are claiming benefit. The NEET group are far more difficult to quantify in number and purpose.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Just for clarification, the NEET group, as you now describe them, do not get benefit. They could be looking for work, of course.

[[[Professor Maguire]]]: Of course they could, yes. The unemployed are a sub-group of the NEET group. We have half a million in England who are unemployed and the rest are classified as inactive. We have “actively seeking” but that is a much more accurate count because they are counted in the unemployment statistics.

[[[The Chairman:]]] They are registered in the jobcentres and so on?

[[[Professor Maguire]]]: They would be registered in the jobcentres and within the labour force survey. When the labour force survey is conducted, they declare themselves as actively seeking work. The inactive group are far more difficult and the problem of quantifying them is greatest within the 16 to 18 group because they have no natural entitlement to income support until the age of 18.

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] Do you think it is important from society’s viewpoint that we should find some mechanism whereby we can stick with them and know of their existence, where they are, what they are doing? Has anybody done any academic work to try to follow a cohort of them for a number of years to assess their cost to society or to themselves in terms of health, perhaps criminality or other areas of social problems that might arise from being in that category? I do not wish to blame anybody in any sense, because a lot of people have problems that lead to the difficulties they encounter, but I wonder whether we follow through what the true cost is when we start talking about them not having anything at all from the state when in fact they are costing the state a lot.

[[[Professor Maguire]]]: The figures for the unknown group were very small, but over the last couple of years they are rocketing because the infrastructure has been withdrawn to map the NEET population. So we have a growing problem with the unknown group and who they are or what they are. We cannot assume that they are NEET, but we do not actually know who they are. Some work was done a couple of years ago by the University of York and the National Audit Office looking at the cost to society of being NEET, so the costs of being NEET have been quantified.

[[[Q17 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] Do you have any ideas about whether it would be right that we should try to track them, as we could prior to 1988?

[[[Professor Maguire]]]: I think it is crucial that we track them, because if we lose young people and they have a destination unknown at the age of 16, we know from the figures that they emerge at the age of 18, having been lost for two years. They turn up at 18 because they can claim benefit and in our eyes they have been left for two years with nothing to do. The problem is far greater to fix if you have left someone for two years, or perhaps longer, than if there is instant intervention at 16 and they are supported and tracked and monitored through the system. We have disturbing numbers of unknown. I have some figures with me that show that the unknown figures since 2010 have doubled or trebled in some areas.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Would it be possible for you to send them to us?

[[[Professor Maguire]]]: I will send the figures to you.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Thank you very much. Professor Sloman, would you like to add to that?

[[[Professor Sloman]]]: Can I defer first to Dr Copeland? I think this is a little more in his area. I will then I come back, if I may.

[[[Dr Copeland]]]: Here is hoping. Maybe I should mention this definition of worklessness or joblessness. This is an interesting one and is even more recent than the NEET classification. Worklessness is an EU-wide definition, and within the literature you will see a flipping between worklessness and joblessness, but it actually means the same thing. The definition here is individuals who are working less than 16 hours a week, so these individuals are still employed albeit working part-time or below 16 hours a week. The definition of worklessness or jobless households, for example, very much features in Europe 2020, the EU’s new reform strategy and successor to the Lisbon agenda, which attempts to define poverty as individuals living in jobless households and is supposed to pick up on issues of economic inactivity. The problem with the definition is twofold. One is that individuals are still working, albeit for 16 hours or less a week, and the second is that the definition itself picks up all economically inactive people, such as those on disability benefits and pensioners. There is a real problem with using a worklessness or joblessness definition to look at the youth unemployment problem. It does not give you an accurate picture of what is really happening out there.

[[[Professor Sloman]]]: Could I make some general comments first, my Lord Chair? I was very pleased to be invited here, but perhaps I should position myself. I am basically a training manager in organisations. That is what I have come through. I have held director roles as head of training in organisations, so I have looked at this problem from a slightly different perspective from the definitions. I would make two very general observations and point you in the direction of something. First of all, this is about the most confused area for vocabulary that it is possible to look at. The definitions of categories seem to vary. You cannot tie them down, and there are multiple schemes and acronyms, all with strange-sounding names. My view is that you have to define the problem before you can comment on the solution. The challenge facing us is whether the problem is one of youth inactivity, a problem of a lost generation, or a problem of a lack of skills for the future through training. Those are quite different problems, but we need to determine which of those we want. With the metrics reporting and definition, it is more important to start with the problem than to try to drill down through definitions. Something that attracted my attention when I was looking at this problem was a Local Government Association report called Hidden Talents. That argued, very powerfully, for a scorecard for local areas, if you could agree a scorecard, because you have three government departments, Education, Business, Innovation and Skills, and DWP, each producing different figures and definitions and each focusing on different areas. I fear that is not an answer to your question but I hope it is an observation that might help the Committee.

[[[Q18 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Cotter:]]] You have spoken about skills, and this is something that is raised time and time again when people come to Parliament—the lack of engineers and the lack of having anticipated this years back—and it can be very much applied to youngsters who perhaps need to roll their sleeves up and do things.

[[[Professor Sloman]]]: We have a very important dialogue going on in this country about the skills of young people at present, and it is very hard to disentangle it. Again, I do not know whether this helps the Committee or not. I live in Norfolk, and Norwich is the nearest place. We have a very serious structural problem there, and it is not untypical. In the 1930s, 30% of girls and 25% of boys went into the boot and shoe industries in Norwich, so you could talk about the skills of boots and shoes. That has totally disappeared. Last week in the Eastern Daily Press, which is our local newspaper, the head of Start-rite—I do not know whether you remember Start-rite, the children’s shoes that used to be made in Norwich—said that he would like to bring it back to Norfolk if he could but at present they are mainly manufacturing in Portugal and Italy, I think from memory, or it might be Portugal and Spain. Are we going to invest in boot and shoe skills in Norwich in the hope that something happens? The answer, of course, is no. We need to get our young people into work as quickly as possible because it is work that produces the skills. People learn skills from work. I can expand on this by all means. What we have at present in Norfolk, which is occupying a lot of my time, is a totally bogus propaganda campaign without any substance, Norwich for Jobs, which masks the real problem. The real problem is not enough jobs at present in the English economy for young school leavers who are not sure what they want to do, and who does at 16. Does that help?

[[[Lord Cotter:]]] Very much, thank you.

[[[The Chairman:]]] I was going to ask you when the issue of skills came up, because surely it has been for ever thus, right from the beginning of the 20th century. How did people become motor mechanics, because there were no motor cars? The skills had to follow the new inventions. I keep coming back to the point that nowadays we say that we are in the digital age and IT is supposed to be the great answer to everything, but the IT skills are more talked about than real and there is a huge gap of people who claim to be skilled and those who are truly skilled in IT. I think this is one of those things that people could major on. The clerk has just asked what we think are the most helpful statistics to look at when we are considering the whole issue of youth unemployment. We are being bombarded by statistics from everywhere. Can I ask the three of you not necessarily to give us the answer to that now but to think about it and see if you can help us through this? Maybe it is OECD, maybe it is the British Government, maybe it is a red book or a green book or a yellow book or something, but we really need to know because I think we are in danger of confusing and comparing unlike with like, so to speak. That is just as an aside.

[[[Q19 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Baroness Hooper:]]] On that issue—I realise this might come up later on the question about the historical situation—there was a time when with national service all young men went into the Army and very often they learnt a skill in that way. Nobody is going to reintroduce national service, I suspect, but perhaps there could be some sort of community service, as in Switzerland and other countries, that could fill that sort of gap. Is this being looked at at all?

[[[Professor Maguire]]]: There is a national citizenship programme that was launched a couple of years ago that offers young people citizenship training over the summer period.

[[[Baroness Hooper:]]] That is not a skill.

[[[Professor Maguire]]]: It is just a programme.

[[[The Chairman:]]] A social service initiative?

[[[Professor Maguire]]]: I think there is huge potential. If we think about the numbers of ageing in society and the growing loneliness that is reported, we have all these people who are in need and all these young people with the capacity to give. It does not seem a bridge too far to join them together.

[[[Lord Kakkar:]]] I find this a rather interesting discussion and I just want to be clear. Are we saying that there is no clear definition of this problem at a European level? If that is the case, how can you have reasonable policy and determine whether that policy is being effective if you do not have a clear definition of the problem and are unable to see whether that policy is actually affecting the numbers if they are changed from time to time because the definition changes?

[[[Dr Copeland]]]: There is an EU-wide definition of youth unemployment that captures individuals from 15 to 24. An issue is that some countries, even the UK, will give slightly different age parameters. In the UK it is 16 to 24, I believe. What normally happens with EU documentation is that they differentiate between youth unemployment and NEETs, just to show you some of the variation and the problems within those statistics. At EU level I think there is an awareness of these problems that we are talking about, but in terms of EU policy and how that affects member states, the EU’s role is very much to guide member states to their own solutions, so there is no top-down, homogenous way of doing things.

[[[The Chairman:]]] I have just been reminded that Professor Maguire could probably give us a quick answer about the best statistics to look for.

[[[Professor Maguire]]]: The statistics that I would look at for the UK are the ONS statistics. The most recent were published in August. They give our figures for 16 to 24 year-olds. There is a statistical bulletin that is published every three or four months. I can send you the link. They would be the figures that I would use.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Thank you very much for that, and thank you for reminding me that we should get the answer now.

[[[Q20 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Fearn:]]] In your view, what is the nature of the current problems with respect to youth unemployment across Europe? Are the key concerns related to the numbers, who is affected, and where are they located across Europe?

[[[Dr Copeland]]]: I may overlap between questions 2 and 3 here, so do excuse me, but I see them as linked. I think it is important to note that youth unemployment is not a recent problem or a recent phenomenon. Back in 1994 the European Commission noted that youth unemployment across the EU stood at 20%, so that is quite high. Of course, in the early 1990s we had the recession, but when you compare the EU to its then main competitors in the early 1990s, the USA and Japan, Europe has had a long-term youth unemployment problem. If we take the current situation in the UK where youth unemployment is at approximately 20%, and we look back at the 20-year period, we will see that 10 years prior to 2008 it was still at 10%, so it is still considerably higher than the then level of general unemployment. Why exactly is this the case? I am of the persuasion that that 10%, that kind of drag on unemployment, is a complex problem. It is for numerous variables to explain this situation, so it is not just a case of individuals with poor training skills. There may also be some social issues involved in that problem. The reasons are clearly not the same as in some other European countries. Our current level of youth unemployment, although it has increased, has not increased as much as other European countries. Our long-term rate of youth unemployment has not been as high as some European countries. When we look across the EU, we see that long term it is the Mediterranean countries that have had a problem here, and we include France within the discussion. These Mediterranean countries have had much higher levels of youth unemployment than the UK and this is because they have often operated dual labour markets, so younger generations find themselves on contracts that are less generous than older generations. It is much easier to dismiss a young person off these contracts, so younger generations get made redundant much more easily. They have this dual labour market system. We started from a situation before the crisis where youth unemployment was high already, and it has increased since 2008, but we think of the problem countries as being those in the Mediterranean because of the downturn. The problem in the UK is similar in the sense that youth unemployment has sky rocketed because there is a lack of jobs. We can talk all day about skills, and skills are fundamentally important, but if you train and retrain the UK’s young and there is no job waiting for them at the end, this is just a waste of money. If you look at northern European countries since 2008, the economies of the Scandinavian countries, Germany and Austria have boomed and their youth unemployment has fallen. I think that serves as a good indicator of the real problem. We have an issue of skills but we have an issue of a lack of jobs, so you have to take a much broader and more holistic perspective on the problem.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Is there not a mismatch? Not everybody who is unemployed can go into these jobs. There are an awful lot of employers looking for people but they cannot take them because they do not have the skills, so it is the mismatch between what the employers think these people are capable of and whether they are capable of being trained in a period of, say, three or four months.

[[[Dr Copeland]]]: I think that long term there is some mismatch, but I do not agree that there has been such a mismatch since 2008. In some instances there have been over 100 applications for one single job. That is not a mismatch of skills; that is a lack of jobs in the economy.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Can I follow that one through? We all know the story about the 5,000 people who applied to Rolls-Royce in Derby to get apprenticeships. It is not that they could not get jobs elsewhere but they have targeted Rolls-Royce because they know that they are going to get terrific training and great skills. That does not mean that all those 5,000 people are not going to get jobs elsewhere. They have just all focused on Rolls-Royce.

[[[Dr Copeland]]]: I still think those numbers are ridiculously high: 5,000 applications for one job.

[[[The Chairman:]]] That is what we have been told.

[[[Professor Sloman]]]: Apprenticeships are something I know a great deal about. That 5,000 is right because it is a very well known, attractive scheme and you would get that. A well structured apprenticeship scheme wherever will get eight or nine applicants, and probably more, for every position. One of the things that concerns me, and I want to put this on the record—I do not know whether it is permissible to produce written material afterwards but I would certainly be keen to do so on this point—

[[[The Chairman:]]] Yes, please.

[[[Professor Sloman]]]: What concerns me is that we are using loose vocabulary to define a problem. On Monday last week the Government announced their new policies on apprenticeships, or at least half of them, and that word is now losing its meaning. The word “apprentice” no longer means what it is considered to be in popular parlance. My father was an apprentice. He was a coachbuilder apprentice for five years. He started off on very limited pay, went through and left with a transferable skill that could be taken anywhere else. Now, the term “apprenticeship” is being used to describe a job with training in a framework defined by the employer. I used to run the graduate investment banking training scheme for NatWest Markets. I could easily, on that definition, call it an apprenticeship and increase the figures. We are setting a target, arbitrarily, for the number of apprenticeships, believing that we are solving the problem, or, bluntly, pretending that we are solving the problem. The most depressing thing is that the announcement last Monday, which was one of the most significant and important announcements in skills training in Britain, passed without any public debate or any mention in the newspapers. It was not mentioned on the news, it did not feature in the serious papers, and yet it is the most profound change in our attitude to skills training in Britain.

[[[Professor Maguire]]]: I think there are two causes of youth unemployment. It is either down to structural changes or a labour queue hypothesis. Structural changes to the youth labour market were most dramatic in this country in the late 1980s and 1990s when the manufacturing sector diminished, and therefore the traditional youth labour market that existed for school leavers was decimated. That damage to the youth labour market has never been repaired because that infrastructure does not exist. After that we went towards encouraging increasing numbers of young people to remain in full-time education as an alternative to finding work. I think we are picking up the consequences of those policies now. We are talking about a broad spectrum of 16 to 24 year-olds, including graduates and young people, who are leaving learning without basically literacy and numeracy, so we cannot group them all together. They have very specific needs and very different skill levels. I think we have to be quite honest here and say that we have not had a real commitment to placing young people in employment for many years, particularly the younger groups. The focus has been on increasing rates in full-time learning, and it is only when young people have emerged from that and that has coincided with a recession that we are suddenly screaming about youth unemployment. I think we have to be honest and say that that has not been a policy priority in this country and in many other countries, unlike Germany, which has always sustained a healthy apprenticeship programme that is well supported and as such has never experienced high levels of youth unemployment since the war.

[[[The Chairman:]]] That is very useful indeed and very sobering. 

[[[Q21 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Earl of ]]]

[[[Liverpool]]]

[[[:]]] I refer to an earlier point made by Dr Copeland. I believe you said that there is a severe shortage of jobs available. This comes back to the confused mixed messages we are getting within this Select Committee. Mr Wells from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills told us something very different last week. He said, “One of the things I should say is that our labour market is sufficiently flexible that there are jobs for everybody in the sense that there is a very dynamic and diverse range. It is actually quite difficult to regard someone as unemployable because the range of jobs in the UK is quite great”. How do we square this circle?

[[[Dr Copeland]]]: In the UK we have issue with skills, and retraining is necessary. I strongly believe, however, that since 2008, if you look at the statistics, there has absolutely been a shortage of jobs. For example, research published in April 2013 by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills was rather critical of the lack of lending for small and medium-sized enterprises since 2008. I wonder whether anybody has actually spoken to anyone between 16 and 24 years-old and asked them about their experiences of employment or trying to get a job, whether they are 18 or after university. I have very first-hand experience of graduates trying to get a job within the sector that I am employed in and I can tell you they face much more difficulty now than they did five years ago. In any kind of analysis of youth unemployment, we can look at the statistics but we also need qualitative accounts of individual experiences, and there is a north-south divide. It is much easier to find a job in the south-east then it is up north. Spend a day in Manchester or Sheffield and you will soon see that the disparities are huge and that if you are a young person in those cities you face much more difficulty than you do in somewhere like London.

[[[Professor Sloman]]]: Can I add something on that? It is not simply a north-south divide. It is also a rural-city divide as well. I live in rural Norfolk. I do not know who your expert witness from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills was but I would very much welcome him to visit north Norfolk. First of all, young people are now entirely dependent on getting to work by some sort of transport, which is enormously difficult anyway. The key thing for them is passing their driving test and having someone who has the money to give them a car, because there is no transport.

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] And pay for the insurance.

[[[Professor Sloman]]]: And pay for the insurance, absolutely right. Yes, that is the big thing. In our little market town, there is a computer shop and I have got to know the fine young woman who is working there. She has a 2:1 degree in criminology and wanted to work with young offenders, and if there is one thing we are not short of it is young offenders. There is plenty of material there for her to work with. She has a record of applying for 20, 30, 40 jobs. Famously she tells the story of applying for one job at Aviva Norwich Union at 6 o’clock one evening and getting an automatic response back at 8 am the following morning from the computer telling her she was not good enough. She has been in touch with the probation service in Norfolk to try to get voluntary work in that area and she says that the problem has been that they are so overwhelmed with young people trying to get job experiences of any sort that the probation service is unable to cope with sorting between people who have some particular interest, a law background or interest in working with young people, and decent young people who are just desperate to get anything on their CV. That is the situation that we are facing, and I firmly believe that it is a structural issue that is a reflection of the world economy and certain jobs going. It applies throughout the whole of Europe. It is more acute in places like Greece and Spain, we know that, and it is less acute in the Netherlands, Austria and Germany, we know that, but it is certainly, most disturbingly for us, a problem that is not moving at all in Britain. However you define it, and I do not have the expertise of my two colleagues, the significant thing about the figure of 958,000 unemployed which Sue referred to is that quarter on quarter it has shifted by 1,000 in 958,000. The 1,000 improvement was entirely in female unemployment. Male unemployment went up in that 16 to 24 category. That is correct, is it not?

[[[Professor Maguire]]]: Yes, but there is a hidden issue around that. It looks as though we have a particular problem with male youth unemployment but that is because we have 355,000 young women between the ages of 16 and 24 who are classified as NEET inactive, so they do not actually appear on the unemployment statistics at all, compared to a figure of 130,000 males. I find it very disturbing that a third of a million young women between the ages of 16 and 24 have been written off already and do not even appear on the unemployment statistics because they are classified as inactive, therefore they are not even picked up by the agencies and are eligible for the Work Programme or the youth contract. I find that quite disturbing.

[[[The Chairman:]]] It is indeed. A lot of what we have unearthed today seems to be disturbing, but we have to crack on a bit I am afraid.

[[[Q22 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] I wanted to follow up on that, but we are moving on. Looking for help from history, if we can, how does what we face now compare with historical experience, either in boom or bust times? Are there lessons that we ought to be able to learn from either good or bad times? When we are trying to look with our telescopes towards the future, is there anything that we can discern coming up in as a result of experience we have had in the past?

[[[Professor Maguire]]]: I think it is probably best to look back to the late 1970s and early 1980s when the huge structural changes occurred to the youth labour market. The intervention then was the youth training scheme, which we will all remember, probably, for its label of slave labour, offering young people pittance wages and employers exploiting them for six months, and things like that. I had the opportunity to look at the evaluation of the youth training scheme a few months ago, and I think that if we had that amount of money and that amount of commitment now we would be rubbing our hands together with glee because it looks like a great programme compared to the opportunities and interventions that are being created for young people currently.What we need to learn from the 1980s experience is that we had young people who were subject to long-term unemployment and the effects of that on their re-engagement and ability to find a job were long lasting. The idea of a scarring effect was born from that experience. If learn anything from that it would be that we should be intervening sooner rather than later, that those interventions should be employment training and education, not just one or the other, and that we should stop blaming young people for this problem. It is society’s problem and we should embrace it and not blame young people because they cannot find jobs. It is impossible for some young people to find jobs.

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] Could you flesh out very briefly the youth training scheme? You say that it was much abused at the time but that actually we would love to have it now if we could. What were the key elements in it?

[[[Professor Maguire]]]: It was a point I made earlier: that at that time we were still tuned into the requirement that young people should find work rather than keeping them in learning, and therefore we understood employers’ needs much more, how they might use young people and in what kind of capacity. We had a much better grip of where young people fitted into the labour market. I am not certain that we would know that now. We know where they go to learn and we know what qualifications fit together, but I am certainly not convinced that we know where young people fit into the labour market in this country. I think we need some intelligence as a base in order to develop policy from that.

[[[Professor Sloman]]]: May I build on that a little? I agree with a lot of what Sue was saying, but I think that we are in a different situation from the situation historically because of structural changes in employment, particularly as they affect young people, and the sort of skills that people need at work are changing. This is one of the reasons, Lord Wilson, why so many young people who do find first jobs find them in either the retail sector or the hospitality sector where the skills needs are pretty easily recognisable, if I can put it that way without diminishing the high quality of training that goes on. I do not think we are going to find a solution in the current cocktail of policies or the traditional cocktail of policies. One thing is certain now: we have far too many schemes. A Select Committee of the House of Commons looking at Jobcentre Plus had evidence from an expert witness who said that they had counted 48 separate schemes in the UK affecting youth unemployment. I read the minutes today and I can reference it. The Local Government Association has identified 35 separate schemes. I do not think there is going to be a solution on schemes. I think we need more radical solutions now. We need to understand, and we can, what drives employers’ training. I am quite happy to say a little more about that. I know a little about what determines that decision to train. I advocate in fact a change in the Companies Act legislation. I do not think we will solve this problem without requiring companies to accept wider social obligations. That is pretty radical but that is where I am coming from.

[[[Q23 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] You have rejected a couple of cocktails. Your cocktail is a sort of single drink, the Companies Act?

[[[Professor Sloman]]]: No, it is not. I have a cocktail of four I can offer you. Very quickly, they are a change in the Companies Act, more devolution to local government because of the triple schemes, a change to the role of the UKCES towards honest reporting, and some sort of charter.

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] Sorry, CES?

[[[Professor Sloman]]]: The UK Commission for Employment and Skills, which has become the scheme promoter. I think we need more honest reporting. We need it to have the sort of role that the financial one has, an Office for Budget Responsibility-type role. Finally, there should be a charter. I will put these in writing.

[[[The Chairman:]]] That would be wonderful. I was about to ask you that and I wondered whether I had the nerve to do so.

[[[Professor Sloman]]]: That was garbled. I apologise.

[[[The Chairman:]]] No, that is really helpful. Lord Wilson, do you have a supplementary question?

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] I have, but do you want to say anything on the earlier point, Dr Copeland?

[[[Dr Copeland]]]: Yes, building on what my two colleagues have said. I will be brief. Sue was talking about the 1980s, but if we look at the 1990s as well we will see that the trends in statistics show some kind of hangover of youth unemployment that lasts for about eight to 10 years, so it can take a good decade for this to actually come down. The interesting thing about earlier peaks in youth unemployment and the current situation is that then we did not have welfare to work, which we do now, which I think has been successful in some respects in getting some individuals back into the labour market. The problem I have when looking at youth unemployment and this idea that it will take about eight to 10 years for youth unemployment to come back down to its pre-recession level is the social consequences of that. We know that when individuals are outside the labour market for a long period, whether they be youth unemployed or general unemployed, they often need much more than something like A4e to get them back into work. There was discussion in the media last week that they could develop physical or mental health issues that cannot be tackled in the more conventional sense and they often require more social intervention. Thinking about this long term, we need to broaden the way that we look at getting people back into work. 

[[[Baroness Hooper:]]] May I pick up a point made by Professor Sloman when he said that we have far too many schemes? We are looking at EU action to tackle unemployment and we are talking about far too many schemes in the UK. If you look around the European Union as a whole, how many does that add up to and how are we finding out what is best practice in relation to what is going on in other countries?

[[[Professor Sloman]]]: As I understand the European youth guarantee and what they call the youth employment initiative, it is meant to be an umbrella commitment with local interpretation. That is probably the correct approach there, given the multitude of schemes that exist. As you can see, I am much more of a commentator than an academic, coming from a practitioner background. The problem is that we cannot say, “Would we not like to be like Germany was 50 years ago today?”, and build on that. Germany has achieved what it has through a variety of circumstances and accidents. Other countries have achieved what they have or what they have failed to achieve through a variety of schemes, but I think it comes down to something pretty basic, and this is where the 48 or the 35 schemes confuse. There are three things. You can act on the supply side, which is that you can try to get more young people to have better skills to begin with, and that is a wide gamut: it is maths and English, very specific skills, communication skills and technology skills. You can act on the demand side by subsidising employers in some way or another to create more jobs, and the Opposition are talking about using public procurement. You can do something on job matching, which is trying to ensure that there is a better match between the market, that the careers service works more effectively, that they get more careers advice, that you get businesses going into schools, and so on, so the market for clearing becomes more efficient. When it comes down to it, those are the three things that you are basically doing, and you can put in the schemes on all that. Where we have suffered is that we insist on overselling whatever the latest scheme is. They have stopped doing it now but I used to read the Business, Innovation and Skills regular update of the schemes, and in one month I counted the word “celebration” used 38 times: “We have celebrated the success of this scheme, we have celebrated the launch”. We have nothing to celebrate.

[[[The Chairman:]]] I think you have made that quite clear. It is a rather confused basket that we are looking at. We have to crack on because we have a lot to get through.

[[[Q24 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Cotter:]]] Thank you very much for your robust contributions. They are very welcome. There are far too many schemes. What do you think about the evidence from the Government suggesting that the position in the UK is rather better than the rest of Europe? Are the Government talking about our actions or the level of unemployment? You are saying a lot about the array of different initiatives. What do you think about this evidence from the Government that we are much better positioned? If so, in what way?

[[[Professor Maguire]]]: I do not think we should be celebrating the fact that we have 1.09 million young people who are classified as NEET and another percentage who we do not even know where they are. In particular, the latter is very worrying. Yes, we are not as bad as Greece and Italy but we have an unacceptable level of youth unemployment and we need some action. We particularly need to tackle the younger age group, between the ages of 16 and 18, where the cuts in services mean that the entitlement to careers guidance and access to support for those young people who are NEET is of grave concern and hence why we have this growing unknown population. We need early intervention to curb a worrying trend of protracted lengths of youth unemployment. I do not think we have much to celebrate. We have a lot to act on.

[[[Professor Sloman]]]: All I would add is that we are mid-table in most of the OECD rankings, which if you are a Norwich City supporter is pretty good going but it is not good news at all. What is worrying is that our situation is deteriorating and the raw figures are not shifting month on month. I keep coming back to that. Whatever we are doing, we are not moving that problem. Youth unemployment now is up there with the care of the elderly or affordable housing in the south-east, which is seen as a critical social problem affecting our development as a society that shows no sign of shifting.

[[[Lord Cotter:]]] I think the overselling of interventions is emerging. I have a strong feeling about the political overselling of things and you seem to be saying the same sort of thing. The youth guarantee scheme has one or two different points and a stable situation. Thank you very much for that. I do not know whether to ask you any more, but I think you have answered with what you have said up to now that perhaps we are overselling things and we need to be more stable and consider the points you are making.

[[[Professor Sloman]]]: We need to get a better information base too about what we are concerned about. Apprenticeships are a good example to take. The number of apprenticeships is going up, but do apprenticeships mean what they used to mean, and all those sorts of things. These become propaganda figures if we do not watch it.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Dr Copeland, were you about to say something?

[[[Dr Copeland]]]: No. For issues of time, I agree with what they—

[[[The Chairman:]]] No, come on.

[[[Dr Copeland]]]: I would like to reiterate the point about the Government saying that the UK position is rather better than the rest of Europe. Youth unemployment in Greece is 65%, so if you compare the UK situation of course it is much better but it is certainly not much better than other northern European countries, echoing the point made by Professor Sloman.

[[[Q25 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Earl of ]]]

[[[Liverpool]]]

[[[:]]] Could you let us know your view on the effectiveness of the actions that have been taken at the EU level so far, such as the youth employment programme and the youth employment initiatives? Are there other ways in which the EU might take more effective action? Before you answer that, could I say that I have read Dr Copeland’s very helpful report that you gave us before the meeting and, reading the last paragraph, I think you are probably going to say something about supporting entrepreneurships.

[[[Dr Copeland]]]: In answer to the first part of the question about how effective have actions been so far at EU level, such as the youth employment programme and youth employment initiatives, I think it is too early to tell. These initiatives have only come forward in the last couple of years. I daresay that in some member states they have not even been acted upon, so it is still too early to make a judgment on the outcomes of EU activity, but I reiterate the point that the EU does not give a policy prescription here for what member states do with regard to youth policy. It very much supports, whether it be by funding or the sharing of best practice, what is going on in that member state. Any EU initiative is then only as good as what is happening at each member state level and the activity and impetus at each member state level. I would say something else about EU activity since 2010. There is an awful of grumbling, particularly in the UK, about how much money the EU wastes—whether that is true or not is of course debatable—particularly when we think about funds for the common agricultural policy. Here we have an example of the EU ring-fencing €6 billion to do something to specifically help its vulnerable. I think the EU is doing something absolutely right here and is not wasting money. Again, member states can do with that at local level how they see fit as long it fits within the parameters of what is prescribed. Are there other ways in which the EU might take more effective action? This is a tricky one because the EU is constrained in what it can do for EU youth policy. We can come up with all sorts of amazing ideas of what the €6 billion could do, but according to the treaty it can only spend the money on education and training. Articles 50 and 126 of the treaty specify that the EU can play a co-ordinating role for youth and education. With the recent initiatives, the Commission and the EU itself has very much fitted in with that legal framework, so we struggle when we want to go beyond it. One idea that I thought would fit in with that framework and could complement some of the activities at EU level is building on some of the initiatives that the EU has done in the structural funds with regard to hub activities, specifically focusing on the EU’s young and helping them to set up their own businesses. That is one thing the EU could do and should do more. We have seen that lending to small and medium-sized enterprises has contracted massively. That is where a lot of jobs and growth will come from in the economy, and there are a considerable number of young people out there who may have ideas and may want to set up their own business, but the resources are quite limited. You could package that in terms of training and so forth. That is one possibility.

[[[Earl of ]]]

[[[Liverpool]]]

[[[:]]] Are you saying that that is not currently possible within the remit of what the European Union is saying it is trying to do with education and training?

[[[Dr Copeland]]]: I believe that within the education and training remit, the recent initiatives of the EU are not doing that to tackle this youth unemployment problem. In the past the structural funds have funded particular regional activities for these hubs, which are usually located close to universities to set up entrepreneurial activities, but I believe that it has not targeted it towards the current set of problems.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Following on directly from Lord Liverpool’s question, we have known about this €6 billion up to 2016 and then €8 billion to 2020 for a very long time, at least it seems a very long time, but we have had very little information about how much of it has been spent, what has been done with it and what the results are.

[[[Professor Sloman]]]: Can I try to clarify a bit and test my understanding? In preparation for this, I tried to dig a little deeper from my position. As I understand it—and I know you have had evidence from the department—they have to present an implementation plan by Christmas. This is the key thing. They are very helpful at the Commission. They have sent me all the documents on the implementation plan, the templates that you have to put your material in, and it covers a wide variety of headings. I am interested from a professional point of view now in how much variance there will be if they publish those implementation plans, different approaches being used across Europe. It is too early to judge the effectiveness of that. If I can pick up the Earl of Liverpool’s question, one thing I would like to see that could be done at European level—and I defer to my professional colleagues on all this—is some sort of protection for the young employee in charter terms. One of the effects of these famous 48, 35 or however many schemes is that there is plenty of evidence now of small-scale abuse, and when there is it is quite serious and disturbing. We have a labour market for young people where employers can take advantage, and there is anecdotal evidence and precise evidence. Let me give you just two examples. Jobs have been advertised on the Government’s National Apprenticeship Service website at below the minimum wage. This is well documented and I will put it in my evidence. Another employer, whose name you will all recognise, advertised on the National Apprenticeship Service for a 37 hour a week trainee unpaid. I think we are at the stage where generally we ought to be thinking about some sort of charter or protection for young workers.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Yes. I am sure you are right. Do you feel that the response at UK level, such as the youth contract and payment by results in the welfare to work area, is pointing in the same direction as EU initiatives, as other member states’ initiatives?

[[[Professor Maguire]]]: I do not think they are, no. The youth guarantee is giving an offer of a job or training place within six months and the €6 billion has to be applauded as a step in the right direction for tackling youth unemployment. Whether that is enough is debatable. I would bring the Committee back to a point I made earlier, which is that you can only give somebody an offer of a job or a training place or an education place if you know they exist, so I think we have to get a handle on the population and be in touch with the whole population in order to implement that policy. In my view, the offer of a job or training is not enough. We have to support and protect young people to make sure that those transitions are sustained, and I think that is where we move on to look at the youth contract in this country. I am involved in the evaluation of the youth contract for 16 and 17 year-olds and it is not just about engaging young people; it is about supporting their transitions into a successful outcome and for six months beyond that so that they are sustained in that outcome, because we know that particularly among the vulnerable groups within the NEET population there is a high churn, that they are prone to drop out. There will be churn, so we need more than an offer. We need sustained intervention and I think the youth contract and the principles that underpin that have got that right.

[[[Q26 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Freeman:]]] We know that dealing with youth unemployment is a matter for member states, essentially, with Brussels holding the purse strings, or at least holding substantial reserves of money that might be deployed in this field. Do you think there is any initiative that we can take in the United Kingdom to encourage Brussels to circulate to all member states best and successful practice in this field? For example, in the United Kingdom, to my own practical knowledge, we are looking at success by charities in trying to provide life skills to the 14 to 16 year-olds and then comparing that with whether they become NEETs in due course. I am very attracted to the idea in Germany of employers receiving a state subsidy so long as there is shown to be success in making sure that the young people employed by companies with state subsidy end up in full-time employment. My question is very simple. Do you think that we should be recommending to the UK Government, and through the UK Government to Brussels, to circulate best practice in all nations?

[[[The Chairman:]]] I see two nodding heads. Dr Copeland, you are the odd man out.

[[[Dr Copeland]]]: The circulation of best practices has long been a banner for EU level activity, whether it be in youth policy or elsewhere, but we think more about the employment strategy, for example, where the more active labour market policies that we have in place at UK level came from other European countries. I believe that active labour market policies, or flexicurity as it was termed then, originate from Denmark and Austria and there was that sharing of best practice at EU level. My understanding of EU-level activity and the sharing of best practice is that some platforms for this are already in existence. The Europe 2020 youth on the move initiative, for example, has an annual conference that brings together representatives from the different member states, where different cohorts of the EU’s young will talk about their experiences but different charities and organisations go along and share their experiences and best practices. I believe that in 2011 the UK declined to send representation to the conference in Poland at the time.

[[[Lord Freeman:]]] Why?

[[[Dr Copeland]]]: You would have to ask the Government.

[[[Lord Freeman:]]] You must have some inkling.

[[[Dr Copeland]]]: Euroscepticism, I should imagine. That would be my gut instinct. Since the coalition Government have taken office, they have withdrawn from some of the softer EU governance processes, whether it be in Europe 2020 and the youth on the move initiative or refusing to set a level of unemployment in the employment strategy of Europe 2020. The reason may be more complex than the one that I suggested, but there definitely are platforms for the sharing of best practice at EU level, and our Government have been rather reluctant more recently to engage in those platforms.

[[[Professor Maguire]]]: To be fair, I represented the UK at a policy exchange in 2011 in Wroclaw in Poland. It was a ministerial conference about policy exchange, and I went and talked at EU level about the implementation of the education maintenance allowance so that other countries could learn from that experience. It may be limited but it has existed. Having said that, it was a bit ironic because the EMA had just been withdrawn in England and I had to stand up and say that, but it was about the policy design and its impact, and other member states were very interested in using financial incentives. There is a missing link in that there does not seem to be any follow-up to see how much progress has been made and whether anyone has moved forward. There was lots of talk about different policies, but I have not heard anything from that meeting in 2011 about whether anyone has taken anything further or implemented it.

[[[Dr Copeland]]]: I think there is a separate issue, which is that the Government more recently have seemed reluctant to send official representation to these meetings of exchange of best practice, for example.

[[[Professor Sloman]]]: Can I add something on this question? One of the queries I have is how the Government feel about this European youth guarantee. You have had the witnesses, I have not, but from the information I have had I do not get the impression that they are feeling very positive about it. It seems to me that this is quite a well designed platform for sharing good practice, the structure and the way it is implemented. I want to make one other small point on the sharing of best practice that has been a concern of mine for some time, having been a training manager. A lot of the implementation is done at the micro level. The policy and the sharing are at the macro level and it comes down to the training managers and so on. We have initiative fatigue and permanent attempts to try to get training managers of organisations to come along to the conferences, to attend these launches and so on. There is also fatigue in the system now when it comes to sharing good practice, and technology is not helping. 

[[[Q27 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[The Chairman:]]] Do you really think that this fatigue, as you call it, is actually preventing best practice being taken up, because there is a lot of it around?

[[[Professor Sloman]]]: Yes, I think there is. You are absolutely right. We have got to the situation now where employers are trying to avoid being engaged in many of these initiatives because they have seen so many come and go.

[[[The Chairman:]]] They have just had too many of them.

[[[Professor Sloman]]]: I do not know whether you are familiar with train to gain. There was a sudden knock on the door on train to gain. There was a knock on the door on the pledge, so you would sign the skills pledge and then that disappeared, then there were foundation degrees, and so it goes on and on. I was a training manager and I learnt a way of coping with that. Our chief executive would be buttonholed by someone who mattered who said, “You must sign up to whatever it is”. He would ask the person down the line to come and see me. It would mean some sort of change that we probably would not want to make anyway and probably would not be acceptable by the time it had gone back up. If I am bluntly honest, the best I could hope for is that it would be forgotten about. It was quite often as crude as that with the training and enterprise councils, the sector skills.Since I have depressed you, however, there is some very positive good practice out here. You mentioned the charity sector, which is doing some outstanding work in this area, as indeed are various religious bodies in that broad area, the churches of various sorts, but some of our sector skills councils are also taking the agenda forward very capably. I am very impressed with Cogent, which is the sector skills council for the chemicals industries. They are doing various good things, but they have built up that relationship of trust over years with the employers, the trade unions and the employees in their sectors, rather than changing the goalposts and the name and suddenly deciding that we have the great revealed truth, “This is what we need to do”.

[[[The Chairman:]]] And have another logo.

[[[Professor Sloman]]]: Let us have another logo, another campaign.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Before we leave that, Professor Maguire and Dr Copeland, what do you think about this best practice? How can we unpick it or at least make it move?

[[[Professor Maguire]]]: I would reiterate what I have said. There are meetings. Perhaps we do not have the official representation, but I think that we should have more follow-up and more action following it. It is all right having a conference to share good practice, but what happens after that? We have a lot of intelligence in this country, for example about the NEET population, its definitions and different segments, and we have a lot to share there across Europe. I think we have a lot to give, and that should be actively encouraged.

[[[Dr Copeland]]]: We talk about the sharing of best practice. We look for short-term immediate results, but all the research on EU-level sharing of best practice talks of a much longer-term impact. The sharing of best practice does not manifest itself within say six or 12 months. It can take four, five, sometimes even 10 years. If we think how employment policy has changed across the EU over the last 15 years, it changed in different countries at different times, albeit all moving towards the active labour market policies, but that sharing of best practice took longer than a couple of years. I just err on the side of caution that with the sharing of best practice we are not looking for immediate tangible results. We need to think slightly more long term.

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] Could we get Professor Sloman to give us a list of these things that have worked? I would be terribly keen to see examples of things that actually have been positive.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Yes, that is a good point.

[[[Professor Sloman]]]: Yes, of course.

[[[Q28 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Haskel:]]] We have had quite a lot of discussion about the supply side and the demand side. You have raised it. You have told us about job matching. But most of the discussion has in fact been about what the EU and the Government can do. What can employers do? You have told us about the sector skills councils. I think most of them have been abandoned, mainly due to arguments over poaching, on my experience. Employers have a great interest in this because they are saying that they want to bring back the shoe business to Norfolk, as you were saying, but they do not have any people to make the shoes. Are they going to get robots instead of humans to sew the shoes?

[[[Professor Sloman]]]: Incidentally, just for the record, it was the industrial training boards that were abolished, not the sector skills councils. The sector skills councils are still very much there and some of them are very effective indeed.

[[[Lord Haskel:]]] That is right, yes. I mean the sector training boards.

[[[Professor Sloman]]]: Incidentally, Lord Haskel, might I say that in the new apprenticeship arrangements White Paper that was published on Monday last week, the sector skills councils were not mentioned at all. It was direct to employers. The answer, of course, is that employers can do an enormous amount. People learn their skills at work. Communication and team-building skills are learnt at work and people learn their skills through having a decent developmental manager who will point out what is going wrong, assist them and spend a bit of time with them. That sort of thing is resource intensive and any particular training scheme is also resource intensive. The problem we have as far as the employer is concerned is that skills development is a third-order decision. The first-order decision is what business are you in, so the question is how you compete, how you deliver the service. The second-order decision is how you organise the work, how the work should be organised. Skills are the third-order decision. This is a simplification, I know, but I believe it to be fundamentally correct. Once you decide how you are going to compete, it is the work organisation, and skills come third. It takes an enormous amount of energy and effort to think outside that model and it takes resources. Lord Wilson talked about my cocktail. The first element in my cocktail would be a change in the Companies Act legislation to ensure that employers meet the social obligation for the development of our workforce in future. That is very controversial, but I do not think we will find a solution within our existing framework while the level of overall demand, and in particular the structural demand as it affects young people, is at the level it is. We will continue to live with a 20% unemployment rate and run the risk of some social disruption. So I think employers need to be fundamentally obliged to do it. That is not popular but that is what I think.

[[[The Chairman:]]] I think a lot of good employers have a very highly developed sense of social responsibility and outreach in the areas from which they operate.

[[[Professor Sloman]]]: Yes, they have. That is absolutely right.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Again it could be the sharing of best practice and more publicity being given to people like that. We have run out of time, unfortunately, but Dr Copeland and Professor Maguire, would you like to add anything to what Professor Sloman has just said?

[[[Q29 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] Before we get to that, could I ask one urgent question? Given that we read in the paper that some major employers are already busy recruiting in Bulgaria and Romania, how do we balance this?

[[[The Chairman:]]] Yes, indeed.

[[[Professor Maguire]]]: I think we have to come back to the policy obsession that there has been over the last 10 to 15 years about retaining young people in education. We have not really engaged with employers about young people to the degree that we should have, and I think we need to be honest about that and to start acknowledging that with employers. I did some research about 10 years ago in Leicester and employers were saying, “We cannot get our hands on young people because they all stay on at school”. We have to be honest and say, “We need your support now. We have a youth unemployment problem. How can we work with you to sort this out?”. We have to be honest and say that we have not done that to a satisfactory degree in recent years.

[[[Dr Copeland]]]: What I wanted to say has been covered by Martyn and Sue.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Thank you all very much indeed. It has been a riveting session. I know I could have gone on for another couple of hours. There are lots of things to ask, particularly on this last point, but I am not going to develop it, and on the point that 50% of all children should go to university and the question of what skills they get at university. All that is part of it, but it is a diversion. We have a very serious position facing us, but I am old enough to remember a very serious position in the 1950s and 1960s, and these things do come round. They always said that recessions showed the brightest ones who had the emotional intelligence to do something about it rather than think that they were going to be making shoes for the rest of their lives and not realising that things like Crocs and trainers got in the way. Thank you very much indeed. You have given up valuable time, but I can assure you it has been very valuable to us.&#xa0;
