defaultSummary
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultA.
default              
defaultLevel Crossings represent a substantial safety risk.
default&#xa0;
defaultB.
default              
defaultBTP works with other agencies to enforce the law around Level Crossings. In particular 
defaultthere is a close and growing partnership between Network Rail and BTP in this area.
default&#xa0;
defaultC.
default              
defaultThe law on Level Crossings is in need of reform and consolidation, and needs to be clearer.
default&#xa0;
defaultD.
default              
defaultEach Level Crossing is different and the mitigation of risk requires a m
defaultulti agency approach.
default&#xa0;
defaultE.
default              
default              
defaultBTP is committed to playing its part in promoting safety at crossings.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultGeneral
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default1.
default              
defaultLevel Crossings are a nineteenth century solution to a nineteenth century problem.  Ideally they would have no place in a modern high speed 
defaultrailway.  The railway industry (particularly Network Rail) is left with the task of managing, what will always be, an unsatisfactory interface between road vehicles and the railway network.
default&#xa0;
default2.
default              
defaultBritish Transport Police (BTP) is the national police service 
defaultfor the railway, including the London Underground.  We have the responsibility for the enforcement of the criminal law and the investigation of offences committed on the railway networks.  The Force exists in its current form under the provisions of the Ra
defaultilways and Transport Safety Act 2003.   Previously the Force operated under the British Transport Commission Act 1949.  Railway police officers have been dealing with incidents on Level Crossings since the mid nineteenth century.
default&#xa0;
default3.
default              
defaultOther agencies, includ
defaulting Her Majesty’s Inspectors in the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) and the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) have a role in investigating incidents at Level Crossings.  BTP seek to work in partnership with these agencies and with Network Rail to e
defaultnforce the law and to promote safety.
default&#xa0;
default4.
default              
defaultDespite the best efforts of Network Rail Level Crossings remain a potential source of a significant railway accident.  History has shown that a collision on a Level Crossing can be catastrophic.  Numerous accidents
default have occurred at these locations.  In modern times we seek to draw lessons from events such as Hixon (1968), Lockington (1986),  Ufton Nevet (2004) and Little Conard (2010)  (1). 
defaultHowever 
defaultnumerous smaller incidents occur every 
defaultmonth
default on Level Crossings, som
defaulte resulting in loss of life and or derailment (2).
default&#xa0;
default5.
default              
defaultThere 
defaultare 
defaultmany different types of Level Crossing.  These vary from crossings on ‘A’ roads through to ‘user worked’ easement crossings between fields.   Each type poses its own issues.  There are often 
defaultdifferent names for the same type of crossing.  The total number of Level Crossings is not clear but is given by Network Rail as being around 6,500.(3).  The ORR estimate that the total number (Network Rail plus others) is around 8,000 (4)  At times the id
defaultentification of individual crossings is difficult and we have been working with Network 
defaultRail to ensure that we have a common understanding of the identity, location and access arrangements for each crossing.  Level Crossings bisect all types of railway lin
defaulte from the West Coast mainline through to freight only single track lines.
default&#xa0;
default6.
default              
defaultSafety at Level Crossings is a worldwide problem.  The recent incident in Canada (18
defaultth
default September 2013) which killed six people is a reminder of the international nature of this 
defaultissue. There were nine accidental fatalities at Level Crossings on the Network Rail system in 2012/13 (5).
default&#xa0;
default7.
default              
defaultBritish Transport Police works closely with Network Rail, both to improve safety at crossings and to enforce legislation where possible.  Network
default Rail has, over the last two years, funded fifteen Mobile Safety Vehicles for BTP use.  These state of the art vehicles are deployed to pubic road crossing throughout Great Britain to detect offenders. (6). Their use is accompanied by local publicity desig
defaultned to raise awareness of the dangers of misusing Level Crossings.  Wherever possible BTP participates in community safety events around the country 
defaultto promote the safety message. 
default Offenders detected using the Mobile Safety Vehicles are, subject to certain
default conditions, offered the option of attending a training course on the dangers of Level Crossing misuse as an alternative to a penalty.  This is a relatively new project so the data set is small – however the available evidence suggests that there is a very
default low re-offending rate by drivers who attend one of these courses. 
default&#xa0;
default8.
default              
defaultI
defaultn recent months BTP and Network Rail have been seeking to improve the flow of information regarding patterns of crossing misuse to ensure that BTP assets can be deployed in the most e
defaultffective way.   Engagement continues to take place with ORR.
default&#xa0;
default9.
default              
defaultBTP sits on various groups with Network Rail, including its strategy group on this subject.  At a Headquarters level BTP meets with Network Rail at least every six weeks to keep abreast of de
defaultvelopments.  BTP is worki
defaultng with Network Rail around 
defaulttheir plan to install fixed detection cameras at high risk locations.
default&#xa0;
default10.
default              
defaultBTP ran an operation to co-inside with the last International Level Crossing awareness day 
defaultin 
defaultMay in 2013 (5).  This day is co-o
defaultrdinated by the International Union of Railways (UIC) who estimate that 359 people were killed at Level Crossings throughout the European Union in 2010. (
default7
default).  
default&#xa0;
default11.
default              
defaultBy far the majority of incidents at Level Crossings can be attributed to user misuse.  Howe
defaultver each incident much be approached carefully to ensure that the collection of evidence takes place systematically and impartially.  BTP Crime Scene Examiners have particular skills in this process and where road vehicles are involved the expertise of loc
defaultal force Roads Policing speci
defaultalists is also used 
defaultto examine the vehicle etc.  In some cases it becomes clear that Network Rail and/or their staff may have caused the incident.  The tragic incident at Moreton-on-Lugg (2010) provides an example of this and r
defaultesulted in the conviction of Network Rail and one of their employees for serious Health and Safety offences.  The investigation of 
defaultLevel Crossing
default incidents is complicated, time consuming and expensive.  It is essential that each investigation is led entire
defaultly by the evidence and not based on assumptions of cause.  In the event of fatalities BTP will always investigate in combination with other agencies and on behalf of HM Coroner (in England and Wales). 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQ1default              defaultAre Current Safety Measures at Level Crossings defaultAdequate?  How Should They Be Improved?default&#xa0;defaultA1
default              
defaultOther organisations are much better placed than BTP to comment on the technical aspects of Level Crossing Safety.
default              
defaultWhat is clear however is that there is no ‘one size fits all’ solution to the question of improvin
defaultg Level Crossing safety.  Each crossing presents 
defaultindividual challenges.  Road layout, user profile, time of day and the nature of the railway being crossed all influence how crossing
defaults
default are used.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe way in which crossings are used can cha
defaultnge.  An obvious example is the 
defaultuse of User Worked Crossing
defaults
default in rural areas during harvest time.  New developments of houses o
defaultr
default shops can change the pattern of use dramatically.  This is not a new issue (
default8
default) but one that requires constant monitoring.  For t
defaulthis reason it is pleasing to see that Network Rail have appoint
defaulted
default local Level Crossing Managers.  We look forward to working with these managers to ensure that policing activity is based on accurate and up to date assessments of misuse.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQ2default              default              defaultIn Addition tdefaulto Bridges and Underpasses What Other Cost Effective Measures Can Be Introduced to Replace Or Improve Safety at Level Crossings?default&#xa0;defaultA2
default              
defaultSee A1 Above.  BTP would support further research should this thought to be necessary.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQ3default              defaultHow Should Expenditure On Improvdefaulting Safety At Level Crossings Be Prioritised in Relation To Other Demands On The Rail Budget?default&#xa0;
defaultA3
default              
defaultThis is largely a question for other respondents.    But in general terms the fact that Level Crossings represent such a major risk to the safety of the railw
defaultay is likely to be a major factor in determining priorities.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe policing of Level Crossings represents a sig
defaultnificant and growing commitment 
defaultfor BTP.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQ4default              default              defaultIs Network Rail Giving Sufficient Priority to Improving Safety At Level Crossings?default&#xa0;defaultA4
default              
defaultIn recent 
defaultyears Network Rail’s commitment to this subject has been unquestionable.  The company has pursued the improvement of safety in this context with passion and dedication.  This comment is made from the point of view of a close partner with visibility only of
default central efforts around a few work streams.   There is nothing to suggest that this energy is not operating throughout the whole Level Crossings project.  Network Rail has appointed the parent of a victim of an accident at a Level Crossing as their Level C
defaultrossings ‘Champion’.  This was a brave move and a bold statement of commitment.  Nobody who has listened to her lecture on the subject of Level Crossing safety can be left in any doubt that there is still much to be done or that this work is of the greates
defaultt importance.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQ5default              defaultIs Government Policy and Regulatory Action By The Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) in Relation to Safety at Level Crossings Adequate?  What More Should The Government and ORR Do?default&#xa0;
defaultA5
default              
defaultBTP is not in a position to assist with this question. 
default The Force works closely with ORR, particularly in the aftermath of incidents.  In this context the working relationship between ORR and BTP is good and highly valued.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQ6default              defaultHow Should Legislation Governing Level Crossings Be Updated?default&#xa0;defaultA6
default              
defaultBTP awaits the pub
defaultlication of the Law Commission’s
default defaultreport on Level Crossings.  We submit that the Law Commission’s comments in Part One of their consultation paper on this subject (2010) provides a good summary of the current legal position,
default (9)
default viz:
default&#xa0;
default              
default“
defaultThe legislation gove
defaultrning level crossings is complex and antiquated, much of it dating back to the nineteenth century when the main railways were constructed. The provisions relevant to level crossings are difficult to access. This arises partly because they are spread across
default legislation relating to a number of different subject areas – railways, highways/roads, health and safety, planning and criminal law. Furthermore, the provisions are contained in a combination of public general Acts, private Acts, bye-laws, and subordinat
defaulte legislation in the form of Orders and Regulations, many of which have been amended heavily in recent years.
default3 
defaultSome of the Acts have been partially repealed and some of their provisions have become spent or obsolete, causing confusion as to which 
defaultprovisions still apply and which are redundant. Many of the Acts of the Victorian era contain terminology that is no longer in use such as “turnpike roads” and “statute labour roads”. Such terminology is unhelpful when trying to interpret the law in a mode
defaultrn context. There has been no attempt at consolidating the legislation in this area.” (P1 Para 1.2)
default&#xa0;
defaultOne particular legislative anomaly is currently cau
defaultsing considerable difficulty in 
defaultrespect of enforcement of Road Traffic Act provisions at Level Crossings
default.  Recent work revealed that the Chief Constable of British Transport Police probably does not have powers under s172 Road Traffic Act 1988 to require the registered keeper of a motor vehicle to supply the details of the driver of the vehicle at the time o
defaultf a suspected offence.  The problem is a technical one that arises from the construction of this section.  The Department for Transport (DfT) are aware of the problem and are working on a solution.  In the meantime the co-operation of geographic police for
defaultces is being employed via the good offices of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO).  What is disheartening is that this lacuna was first identified over thirty years ago and was corrected by the British Railways Act 1986.  However the principal 
defaultlegislation at the time, the Road Traffic Act 1972, was replaced shortly afterwards by the Road Traffic Act 1988 and it appears that the changes brought about by the 1986 Act have been lost.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultThe legislation on railway trespass is also unclear.  The princ
defaultipal piece of legislation creating an offence of criminal trespass on railways is s55 British Transport Commission Act 1949.  This provision largely recreates the offences that previously existed in the Acts of Parliament that governed the individual railw
defaultay companies.  What is uncertain is whether or not it is possible for the offence to be committed on a level crossing when it is ‘closed’ for the passage of a train.  This issue is acute at crossings without physical barriers.  Pedestrians passing in front
default of trains at crossings are a serious problem.  S55 requires that a  trespass warning notice is displayed at the nearest passenger station – not at Level Crossings.  The relevance of this requirement is hard to see and is itself an anachronism.   The Law C
defaultommission consultation discusses this offence at useful length (Part 13 2010).  It notes: that  “ A particular feature of the section 55 offence is its obscurity”  (
default10
default)  We therefore agree that this area of law should be subject to review with the intentio
defaultn of making the offence clear, both generally and specifically in relation to Level Crossings.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultThe rai
defaultlway industry and occasionally 
defaultthe Force are called to deal with gates that have been left open at User Worked Crossings.  The law covering this problem
default is to be found in the Railway Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 and in the Railway Clauses Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1845.  These Acts create a penalty for failing to close a gate.  To enforce this the individual who fails to close the gate has to be iden
defaulttified.  We would suggest that consideration is given to the creation of a duty on the landowner to ensure that gates are shut. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultA case could be made for Level Crossing offences to attract higher penalties than those for equivalent offences on other road
defaults (failure to comply with a road traffic signal for example).   
defaultThis would require a detailed assessment of the potential for a deterrent effect if such a change were not seen to be punitive.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQ7default              default       How Should Public Awareness of Safety at Level Crossings Be Improved?default&#xa0;defaultA7
default              
defaultThis is an area that would benefit from continued specialised research.  There could be possible opportunities to increase the amount time given to Level Crossings in initial 
defaultdriver training and testing, both for new drivers and for specialist driving qualifications (Good Vehicles etc).
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is a fundamental problem that road vehicle drivers will take risks at Level        Crossings when they would hesitate to do so at other 
defaultpoints of traffic control.  The ‘human factors’ aspects of this behaviour may benefit from further research.
