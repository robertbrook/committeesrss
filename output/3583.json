"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence from Mike Rawson (HSR 003)\n&#xa0;              \n              \n              \n              \n  \n             \nSUMMARY\n&#xa0;\n8   The 3 hour journey \ntarget\n – London - Scotland\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe objectives are clear, the solution\n offered by HS2,\n is wrong. A new North – South Railway \nmust double \ncapacity on the East &amp; West Coast routes whilst offering \ndirect \nservices to the continent \nfrom The Midlands and The North of E\nngland to encourage the switch from the plane to the train to reduce carbon emissions.\nThe new railway must take the rare opportunity to \nconstruct\n ‘\nthrough London’ \nservices to connect the north and the south of \nthe country\n. \nIn the heart of the capitol i\nt must \nprovid\ne\n excellent connectivity \nwith CROSSRAIL \nservices to\n \nHeathrow Airport, The City and Canary Wharf \nas well as to\n London Underground services.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe design of the route means ALL trains from London will call at Birmingham\n,\n making the route between the capitol and Leeds illogical\n,\n and the journey \nbetween\n Leeds \nand\n the continent, absurd.\nIt is planned for HS2 trains to depart from Leeds, travel south west to Birmingham, continue past Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, \ntravel \nthrough Hillingdon, Ruislip and Acton in West London, enter a \nVictorian tunnel around North London to Stratford in East London\n,\n before joining HS1 tracks to Folkestone and the Channel Tunnel!\nLittle wonder the airlines are unconcerned by HS2 – the train offers no serious threat to the seventy minute flight from Leeds\n/ Bradford to Paris.\nIt should be remembered a part of the justification of the cost of HS2 is the reduction in carbon emissions. As the route of HS2 will ensure no reduction in flights to the near continent the claim is spurious.\n&#xa0;\nThe Prime Minister insis\nts there is absolutely no alternative to HS2. With all due respect to Mr Cameron, he is wrong!\n    \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nStarting in the very heart of the capitol (possibly at the new £1bn Tottenham Court Road CROSSRAIL Station) \nfour tracks, \nin tunnels for eight miles beneath North London, follow the traditional transport \ncorr\nidor\n of the M1 Motorway.\nNear Junction 19\n,\n the tracks \ndiverge\n,\n \nwith one route following the M6 to Birmingham and Manchester whilst the other route follows the M1 to East Midlands Parkway and Leeds.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nA \ntriangle \ndesign, where the tracks diverge, enables \nsuperb connectivity between towns and cities in The Midlands and The North of England.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAs the railway is below ground in London it allows for a spur to Kings Cross/St Pancras as well as a short link, \nfro\nm \nnorth of Kings Cross station, to HS1 tracks \nproviding \nattractive \n‘through’ \nservices from \nThe North to the Continent.\nA connection with LONDON OVERGROUND services at Finchley Road contributes to a reduction in potential overcrowding in the central London \nstatio\nn whilst \nprovid\ning\n passengers with \nnumerous\n onward journey \noptions.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe trains are generally restricted to 140mph, except where straight sections of track permit a higher speed, but are capable of speeds of\n 200mph when operating on the continent. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n225mph (the projected speed of HS2) is a little less than four miles per minute. \n140mph (on average the speed of EAST &amp; WEST COAST 2 t\nrains) is a little less than two and half miles per minute.\nThe time difference for a 100 mile journey is \nten minutes!\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nUnlike France, Spain and China\n,\n our towns and cities are relatively close together\n and 225mph trains are neither necessary nor justifie\nd.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIt is effectively \nTWO \nRailways, with the section between London and Junction 19\n in Leicestershire\n, running parallel.\nThe design permits \ntwenty four trains per hour\n \n(twelve between London &amp; Manchester\n via Birmingham\n and twelve between London\n &amp; Leeds via East Midlands Parkway)\n \nwhen running five minutes apart.\nHS2, by comparison, permits\n \ntwelve trains per hour \n(six \nbetween \nLondon \n&amp; Manchester via\n Birmingham\n and six between London &amp; Leeds via \nBirmingham\n)\n.\nPut another way, assuming a loading of 800 per train, HS2 will carry 9\n,\n600 passengers per hour at peak operation.\nEast &amp; West Coast 2 will carry almost 20\n,\n000!\nIf, as govern\nment claims, capacity is the major issue when it comes to investing in the future of our railways, HS2 comes a poor second!\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n \n&#xa0;\n"
