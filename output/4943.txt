[[[Written evidence from the Police and Crime Commissioner for Gwent [CST0062]]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;Thank you for your recent letters concerning crime statistics, particularly relating toGwent Police.&#xa0;Your Committee may wish to note that my wife and I booked a holiday in August 2013 and consequently I was out of the country from 18 November 2013 for five days.&#xa0;Your kind invitation to attend your Committee hearing was received some two/threeweeks prior to my proposed attendance.&#xa0;I am sure that you will appreciate that there is a huge difference between "failing to turn up" (as reported in our local media) and actually being out of the country.&#xa0;In response to your specific questions:&#xa0;1. The report that I jointly commissioned with the new Chief Constable was a snapshot of one week in July 2013.&#xa0;The report deliberately concentrated on those incidents that were "questionable". I was not surprised that a high proportion, according to the counting rules, should have been recorded. This does not overly concern me as officers were acting in the interests of members of the public.&#xa0;Finally the report gave me reassurance that behaviours that had been brought about by the previous obsession with reducing recorded crime had been addressed.&#xa0;2. I am content that the crime statistics in Gwent are recorded within the Home Office Counting Rules, and you will have heard our Chief Constable confirm to your Committee his commitment to ensuring an ethical approach to crime recording.&#xa0;3. I fully stand by my comments made in April 2013. Your Committee may wish to note that I have never used the term "manipulation" in relation to crime recording. It is my view that the imposition of daily ceilings on the number of crimes allowed to be recorded each day had a hugely negative impact on how officers dealt with victims of crime.&#xa0;Gwent Police showed a reduction of 20% in recorded crime. The public did not believe the figures and neither did the officers.&#xa0;Performance dials on computer screens and cheap and tacky banners "celebrating" success were viewed by many officers as unprofessional and totally misleading.&#xa0;It is important to note that during six months of "electioneering" and five months of attending mainly public meetings, the feedback was consistent- officers were more concerned about whether an incident should be recorded as a crime than actually providing a service to the victim.&#xa0;4. My Deputy attends the Data Quality Assurance Board which will be taking forward and monitoring an action plan resulting from the recommendations in the Crime Recording Report.&#xa0;The Chief Constable and I will continue to monitor crime recording practices by undertaking further reviews to ensure the public of Gwent can have confidence in the recorded crime levels.&#xa0;Additionally Gwent Police will be the subject of an inspection by HMIC in 2014.&#xa0;In conclusion I wish you and your Committee members best wishes for 2014.&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;
