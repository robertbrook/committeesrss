"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Simon Lay (CYS0117)&#xa0;\nSummary&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis submission considers cycle safety with regards to compliance of road traffic laws at road junctions and the role of the police in maintaining or enhancing safety.\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis submission includes data and conclusions drawn from a\n previously unreported \nindependent study of cycle and motor vehicle behaviour at traffic light controlled junctions in Greater Manchester.\n&#xa0;\n- This submission includes evidence witnessed in relation\n to cycle related policing behaviour in Greater Manchester and London.\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis submission is by Mr Simon \nLay\n a resident of Trafford borough in Greater Manchester, a cyclist and a car driver who commutes by bicycle as well as engaging in cycling for fitness a\nnd leisure. Mr \nLay\n  regularly commutes along routes which were assessed in the recent (ongoing) Greater Manchester Police (GMP) operation \"Grimaldi\". Mr \nLay\n cycles throughout the year and at a wide range of times of day including rush hour and quieter peri\nods. Mr \nLay\n contributes to the Trafford Cycle Forum, a cycle user group organised by Trafford Council to consider cycle related matters.\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBased on personal experience and evidence gathered through information provided by GMP and independent surveys of traf\nfic behaviour, the following summary conclusions have been reached:\n&#xa0;\ni.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is evidence of a deep rooted and institutionalised \"anti-cycle\" attitude within GMP (and other police forces).\nii.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe current policing tactics stated as being pro-safety are based on a\n principle of victim blaming and make little or no attempt to combat dangerous practices by motor vehicle users.\niii.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPolicing action to date has largely been based on poor background statistics and invalid suppositions which the police actions inherently reinf\norce due to the poorly designed nature of the police action.\niv.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCurrent policing tactics serve to alienate cyclists and do little if anything to contribute to an enhanced safety environment for vulnerable road users, ultimately counteracting positive efforts \nby local authorities and others\n to promote and encourage cycling\n.\nv.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe knowledge of law relating to cycling and the asymmetrical relationship between cycles and motor vehicles is very poor within the police.\nvi.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTraining and a change in police tactics driven fo\nr the highest levels is necessary to engage cyclists, improve safety for all vulnerable road users.\nvii.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf policing tactics remain as they are, they form a significant barrier to increasing cycling as a mode of transport.\n&#xa0;\n1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIntroduction&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0; \nGreater \nManchester ha\ns a number of commercial centres located in the various metropolitan boroughs arranged radially around the main business hub within the City Centre. A significant number of business commuters move to and from the City Centre by bicycle, particularly from t\nhe a South and West with those commuting routes joining the main A34 \"Oxford Rd\" into the centre. \n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0; \nCycle flow along the A34 is further increased during term times by the high student population which includes cycle users in a greater proporti\non than the general population. The high student numbers travelling from the South and West towards the main University campuses (located just South of the City Centre) also leads to a very high number of busses along the A34 route.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0; \nThe countryside to the\n South and West of Manchester (where it meets Cheshire) is a major hot spot for sporting cyclists as well as families cycling for leisure. As the home of British Cycling, Manchester has a number of very positive, pro cycling factors. Residents of the city \nare proud of its cycling facilities and the international success and notoriety this has brought. The city was fortunate to turn this positive legacy into a forward looking plan winning significant funding from Central Government for the VeloCity initiativ\ne which intends to \nachieve a 300% increase in \ncycling across Greater Manchester by 20\n25\n. Cycling in Manchester has increased in recent years and is set to continue to increase in the future.\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n&#xa0; \nAs a cyclist who habitually obeys traffic laws and seeks to act \nin a manner which is considerate and safe, Mr \nLay\n was concerned that some cyclists and drivers appear to routinely act dangerously and that there is an apparent belief amongst many drivers that cyclists are a law breaking nuisance that the police fail to a\nct against and a corresponding belief amongst cyclists that drivers are dangerous law breakers out to kill cyclists that the police fail to act against.  With this in mind Mr \nLay\n and others undertook a study of traffic behaviour at a number of junctions al\nong a primary cycle commuting route that links the borough of Trafford to the City Centre. \n&#xa0;\n1.5\n&#xa0; \nThe study by Mr \nLay\n included junctions that featured in the GMP operation Grimaldi exercise providing useful data for consideration alongside that policing effort.\n&#xa0;\n1.6\n&#xa0; \nWhilst conducting the study, Mr \nLay\n was also able to witness policing tactics by GMP and consider the conclusions drawn by operation Grimaldi, many of which are not substantiated by the observations made during the study.\n&#xa0;2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA Study Of Cycle And Motor Vehicle Behaviour At Road Junctions Controlled By Traffic Lights or The Red Light Jumping (RLJ) Study&#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0; \nThe study monitored 3 different locations leading to and along the A34 corridor in Manchester. During the study, the following was observed at each change of\n the traffic lights during peak traffic periods.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nA.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAncillary observations.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0; \nThe study \nrecorded over \n400 \ndata points. The number of motor vehicles and cycles was not specifically tracked as the objective of the study was to observe the behaviour of those at the front of a traffic queue when the lights change; those with the opportunity to ju\nmp the lights.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0; \nThe study was able to establish that the \"jumping\" of lights on amber and red is an opportunistic offence determined by the perception of personal injury risk and the perceived chance of being caught. It was possible to observe that in \ngeneral:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n&#xa0; \nIt was clearly observed \n(fig 1) \nthat when presented with the opportunity to jump a light\n (ie being at the front of a traffic queue) many drivers will jump a light. At peak times at junctions which have no monitoring by cameras and have good visibility for drivers, it was observed that up to 90% of \nthe time, \ndrivers would commit an offence and\n either pass through a signal on amber when they could and should have stopped or pass through a red light. The corresponding figure for cyclists was less than half that observed for drivers.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFig 1:&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n&#xa0; \nAll of the junctions observed in the RLJ Study feat\nure a cycle lane leading to the junction and an ASL. Cyclists are therefore able to pass down a queue of traffic and at almost every light change cyclists have the opportunity to be at the front of the queue and make a decision to jump the lights or not. F\nor drivers, only one or two vehicles are in a position to make a decision to jump the lights or not as the rest if the traffic is held back by the queue.\n&#xa0;\n2.6\n&#xa0; \nThere was a clear trend observed that if one driver jumped a light on amber, the following driver was\n highly likely to jump the subsequent red light by \"tailgating\" the vehicle in front. This effect was not observed with cycles, and instead cyclists appear to make a personal choice.\n It was not unusual that in the cases when a cyclist did commit an offence\n that they might pass by other cyclists who had stopped. \nThis reflects the principle that cyclists actions are governed by personal risk of injury, whilst the drivers take the view that a driver ahead of them is unlikely to jump a light if there is a likel\nihood of being caught.\n&#xa0;\n2.7\n&#xa0; \nBy a significant margin the primary motor vehicle observed to jump a light was taxis (both private hire and taxi cabs), followed by busses and then private vehicles and trades vans. \n&#xa0;\n2.8\n&#xa0; \nAt almost every light change during rush hour, v\nehicles blocked at least one ASL on a junction.\n&#xa0;\n2.9\n&#xa0; \nDuring the study GMP vehicles were witnessed jumping amber lights and blocking ASLs.\n&#xa0;\n2.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA number of drivers jumping lights or blocking ASLs were noted to be using mobile phones.\n&#xa0;\n2.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOver \n400\n motor vehicles were observed committing an offence during the study. On no occasion was any police action witnessed to have been taken against any of the drivers despite there being occasions where GMP officers were in a position to witness the offence.\n&#xa0;\n2.12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere was no discernible demographic pattern amongst those cyclists who jumped lights. Lycra clad middle aged men, young men with beards, teenagers, young ladies, elderly women, \nold men, white European, Afro-Caribbean or Asian cyclists were all equally lik\nely to be one of the people who jumped lights. \n&#xa0;\n2.13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere was a slight trend towards young women seeking to \"get ahead\" of the lights by setting off once they could see the perpendicular traffic had stopped. This may be due to publicity surrounding the worryi\nngly disproportionate number of female cyclists killed or injured and the suggestion that this may be due to a typically slower starting speed by some cyclists.\n&#xa0;\n2.14\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe road layout \n(fig 2) \nhad a significant impact on whether cyclists jumped a light or not:\n&#xa0;\na.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nC\nyclists were unlikely to jump a light and take a risk when the junction was wide.\n&#xa0;\nb.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCyclists were more likely to jump a light in an asymmetrical junction where motor vehicle traffic was prevented on one or more axes of the junction.\n However, cycles typicall\ny \n“\njumped\n”\n \nthe lights when a 4 way pedestrian crossing had stopped all motor traffic.\n&#xa0;\n2.15\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRoad layout was less significant as a factor to \ndrivers deciding to jump or not (fig 2). Instead, the likelihood of jumping was roughly the same for all junction configu\nrations.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.16\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThroughout the study, the overwhelming majority of cyclists were observed to fully comply with traffic signals. The overwhelming majority of cyclists were clearly aware of their surroundings and took preventative action to avoid collisions wi\nth drivers that were acting in a hazardous manner. The majority of cyclists wore helmets, had lights on their cycles when necessary and many had added high-visibility clothing or features to their attire. No cyclists were seen using a phone whilst cycling \nand very few wore headphones.\n&#xa0;\n3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRLJ Study Conclusions and Comparison with GMP Findings&#xa0;\n3.1\n&#xa0; \nContrary to the subjective and poorly sampled opinions reached by GMP during operation Grimaldi:\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is absolutely no evidence of a \"culture of cyclists treating red \nlights as a give way\"\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCyclists are well aware of the laws of the road\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCyclists are generally aware of the hazards around them and constantly make hazard assessments and adjust their position on the road accordingly\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nVery few cyclists ride on the pavement, \nand no cyclists were observed to ride solely on the pavement\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCyclists wear a wide range of clothing with many having some hi-visibility feature in their attire\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0; \nThe RLJ Study did corroborate the finding from operation Grimaldi that some cyclists seek to \"g\net ahead\" of the traffic and cross the stop line for this purpose only. This was observed in female cyclists more than male, but the division by sex was not fully recorded.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n&#xa0; \nUnfortunately the operation Grimaldi did not draw any data from law abiding cyclis\nts, the GMP drew conclusions only from the set of individuals that they had stopped. This sadly reinforced the view that the police already have of cyclists being law breakers. This would be akin to conducting a crime survey in a prison and assuming that t\nhe results apply across the surrounding area.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n&#xa0; \nIt is certainly true that many cyclists feel that the operation Grimaldi was heavy handed, anti-cyclist and asymmetrically failed to focus on the main causes of injury to cyclists (violations by motor vehicles\n).\n&#xa0;\n3.5\n&#xa0; \nThere is a strong sense that the police are willing to expend time and effort to apprehend victims of road traffic accidents by using minor offences to entrap them and force education upon them, but that the police are unwilling to apply any action aga\ninst motorists committing similar minor offences that have potentially major consequences for vulnerable road users such as:\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBlocking ASLs\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBeing distracted by a mobile device wilts driving\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFailing to have full control of a vehicle due to driving whilst sm\noking, drinking / eating, reading or personal grooming\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nJumping amber traffic signals\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBlocking cycle paths\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCutting in front of cyclists in a dangerous manner\n&#xa0;\n3.6\n&#xa0; \nCyclists do believe that other road users should look out for them, but there is no evidence that \nthey correspondingly believe that this relieves them of a duty of personal care. In fact, evidence from the RLJ study is almost wholly to the contrary.  In general cyclists do believe that the responsibility of care should asymmetrically be placed on motor\nists as they have the ability to kill and maim a cyclist, whilst in practice the responsibility of care is actually exercised by cyclists because there is little or no enforcement of dangerous driving practices and that if cyclists did not take care, then \nmany more \"near misses\" would be KSI statistics.\n&#xa0;\n3.7\n&#xa0; \nSadly there is little or no evidence of any positive safety effect from operation Grimaldi and other similar police operations. There has been no reported reduction in KSIs and sadly the only cyclist death \nrecorded in Greater Manchester occurred after the commencement of operation Grimaldi.\n&#xa0;\n3.8\n&#xa0; \nGrimaldi and similar operations have dr\niven a rift between cyclists and the police. The reported outcomes of such operations have focused on victim blaming and served to reinforce myths and prejudice against cyclists which are contrary to prior studies of cycling behaviour in the UK and oversea\ns. The efforts put into publicity of the penalty notices issued to cyclists only serves to counteract the positive efforts by local authorities to promote cycling and in some instances where GMP have sought to extend operation Grimaldi they have been asked\n to modify the \noperation to make it less anti-cycling or politely asked not to bring the operation into some boroughs.\n&#xa0;\n3.9\n&#xa0; \nThere was an inherent premise within operation Grimaldi that cyclists acting in a dangerous manner was the cause of accident or injury. \nHowever, in establishing Grimaldi the GMP did not first ascertain that cyclists were at fault. Instead it seems that as cyclists are easier to stop, less numerous and generally a compliant group of individuals, a decision was taken to focus on cyclist beha\nviour rather than driver behaviour. Any non cyclist offences recorded were incidental to the operation, not a targeted element.\n&#xa0;\n3.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt was also noted that when ticketing cyclists for offences, an education course was offered in lieu of a fine. However, driver\ns were simply fined for offences they committed. This implies that GMP do not feel that drivers need any further education in road safety which could be argued to be manifestly untrue given that the drivers were stopped for offences that represented unsafe\n actions. \n&#xa0;\n3.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt was concluded by GMP that few cyclists are trained in safety, which is not \nsupported by other evidence such as that from British Cycling\n. The majority of cyclists who commute by cycle are also drivers who have received at least the same road\n safety training as other drivers. If drivers who cycle require further education, then it is equally if not more true that drivers who do not cycle require further instruction in road safety for vulnerable users.\n&#xa0;\n3.12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is a fundament lack of understandin\ng by GMP of the asymmetrical nature of risk and traffic offences and how this impacts on the safety of vulnerable users on roads when interacting with motor vehicles. Offences by drivers which are typically viewed as minor or inconsequential such as the bl\nocking of cycle routes, illegal parking, jumping amber traffic lights and blocking ASLs have major implications for the safety of cyclists. Conversely, cycling offences viewed as \"minor\" such as inadequate lights or a failure to adopt advisory measures suc\nh as helmets or to not use headphones are not shown to have a correspondingly major impact on risk to cyclists. All the hi-viz and lights in the world won't help a cyclist if drivers are distracted from watching the road or the driver does not look properl\ny. \n&#xa0;\n3.13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA failure of the police to adequately enforce amber lights at junctions and the abuse of ASLs by drivers are perhaps amongst the most prevalent driving practices that are in fact offences unenforced by the police. A driver should slow and prepare to s\ntop as they approach a traffic light so that they can stop if the light goes to amber and so that they do not block an ASL With the exception of a minutia of cases, a driver who jumps an amber light or blocks an ASL was, by definition driving too fast or w\nithout paying due attention to the road conditions. \n&#xa0;\n3.14\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is difficult to catch drivers who jump amber lights or who block ASLs, it is however simple to stop cyclists without lights or who jumped lights. This practical reality lies behind the tactics of ope\nration Grimaldi and similar operations by other forces. This is lazy policing and a poor expenditure of public money.\n&#xa0;\n3.15\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBy failing to properly address the main hazards to cyclists and instead blaming cyclists, the victims in nearly all cycle / motor vehicle\n accidents, is poor use of public money and does not contribute to a safer environment. This approach also reinforces the false impression in the eyes of some drivers that cyclists are inherently at fault and leads to a negative and even a hostile attitude\n towards cyclists.\n&#xa0;\n3.16\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is perhaps significant that the only death of a cyclist on the Greater Manchester roads, that of Jaye Bloomfield occurred during the operation Grimaldi. A solitary and grim reminder that cyclists can be victims no matter how they dre\nss and no matter how safe their bike if drivers act in a dangerous manner.\n&#xa0;\n4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConclusions &amp; Recommendations&#xa0;\n4.1\n&#xa0; \nIt is hard to distinguish individual anti-cycle programmes by GMP from a deep rooted, institutionalised anti-cycling philosophy in the police. On the\n bias that high profile operations such as Grimaldi originate at senior level within the police or are overseen by high ranking officers without questioning the validity or fairness of the action can only suggest an anti-cycling policy embedded deep enough\n that it is no longer possible for the police to recognise their own failings. If this is not corrected, it will hamper growth in cycling and lead to injury and death on our roads.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n&#xa0; \nThe police should play a key role in changing poor habits of drivers and i\nn creating a positive attitude to cycling. This is possible and in the short term, the police have one of the most significant contributions to make to increasing the numbers of journeys by cycles. However, currently they are failing in this role.\n&#xa0;\n4.3\n&#xa0; \nThe fol\nlowing recommendations are considered necessary to overcome the failings identified above:\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe police need to be trained to understand the asymmetrical relationship between cycles and motor vehicles and to understand that motoring offences routinely ignor\ned by the police are a significant risk to cyclists.\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe police need to respond better to complaints of poor driving. At the moment, the standards of evidence expected are such that evidence from cyclists is routinely ignored and bad drivers are not \npunished or even questioned.\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA root and branch review of police attitudes to cycling is required and an action plan put in place to match the efforts being made \nby national government, local government and others \nto promote cycling at national and local l\nevel as a mode of transport.\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRoad safety training within the driving test should include a period spent \nspecifically considering the needs of \nvulnerable road user\ns, (both first hand and indirectly) \nand cycle \nawareness \ntraining should feature within the dr\niving test.\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAll road users issued a FPN for a minor road traffic offence should have to attend a safety course which highlights the risk \nthey can pose \nto vulnerable road users. \n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe police should adopt a strong policy of addressing all driving offences t\nhat put vulnerable road users at risk, no matter how minor individual officers or the wider force policy considers such offences.\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMore efforts should be made to understand why some cyclists jump lights\n. Where cyclists are seen to jump lights but there is no evidence of this creating a hazard to vehicles or pedestrians then greater consideration should be given to experimental, simple infrastructure changes such as allowing cycles to cross on a 4 way ped\nestrian green and allowing cycles to filter left on red. Alternatively, a high number of cyclists crossing the stop line to get ahead of traffic should be taken as an indication of a need to amend the infrastructure \nas a protective measure, to reduce the r\nisk to cyclists. This may include larger ASL spaces, advanced \"go\" lights for cycles and similar measures.\n&#xa0;\n4.4\n&#xa0; \nWhilst there is much focus on cycle infrastructure and grand plans for the future, if the police continue to \nfail to use their powers within the law\n as it currently stands and continue to \nfail to reprimand drivers for the types of traffic offenses that create a hazard to cyclists and other vulnerable users, then the police will instead continue to reinforce an anti-cycling, pro-driver climate.\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
