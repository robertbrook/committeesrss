default&#xa0;
default1.default defaultAre crimes being recorded by the police when they should be? Are crimes being categorised defaultcorrectly?default&#xa0;defaultAn interesting opening question as nothing is ever straight forward particularly given the subjective judgements when interpreting the counting rules
default.  Influencing factors, in no particular order include, but are not restricted to:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe raison d’être of NCRS is to promote greater consistency between police forces 
defaultin the recording of crime and to ensure a more victim focused approach.  
defaultInterpretation of NCRS and the counting rules
default is however subjective and the topic of much debate and 
defaultdiscussion nationally on many occasions.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe general principles of the NCRS rightly focus on a victim centric crime recording process.  In other words if a victim makes an allegation that amounts to an offence in law which is contained within the 
defaultnotifiab
defaultle
default crime series
default,
default then such a crime should be recorded unless there is evidence to contradict that which is alleged.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the current financial climate
default,
default the cost of any “back office” support function has to be balanced against operational
default requirements.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe guiding principal is compliance with national standards however internal checks and balances vary between forces and 
defaulta consequence of Performance Targets is the adoption of a innovat
defaultive
default approach
defaultes
default to crime recording together with an element of manipula
defaulttion / manoeuvring of crime statistics.  
defaultWithin 
defaultSussex
default risk based NSIR/NCRS auditing enable early remedial intervention, where necessary, to ensure practices and procedures are fit for purpose.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultAn
default outside audit pressure 
defaultenhances the
default focus on the integrit
defaulty of crime recording.  HMIC do a valuable job in this respect and the upcoming audit plan seems to focus on meaningful reviews including outcomes.  It would be of benefit for the numbers of records audited to be increased to allow a 'substantial' benchmark
default for future audits.  The current numbers do not allow a reasonable conclusion to be drawn on the figures provided
default, nor by their own understanding, legitimate comparison between forces.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe advent of the PCCs has also had a positive impact in this area.  A
defaults they are electable positions and therefore accountable for the pledges they have made there is a keener sense that the crime data should be more ethical and correct.  It is 
defaultmore significant when a
default force shows a reduction in crime, 
defaultand
default they are audited by
default an external agency
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe victim based approach means evaluation 
defaultof 
defaultwhether to
default record as a
default crime or not should be based on the initial information provided
default.
default  
defaultWe are oft
defaulten being reminded that HOCR and NCRS is fit for purpose but there are always numerous 'slight' changes being made and various offences being moved between sections.  This will make any future comparisons difficult if not impossible.  Next year will see a h
defaultuge change in the way that forces record outcomes which may well add
default,
default inadvertently
default,
default another performance indicator between forces.  To ensure that crime data will be appropriately comparable over the foreseeable future and allow forces to go forward in the
default knowledge that the playing field will not be changed there should (in my view) be no further large scale changes to HOCR.
default&#xa0;
defaultSussex Police has moved a long way from red/green targets to developing performance products that really help to understand the busi
defaultness.  
defaultThis contributes to achieving
default ethical recording.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWhilst it is clear that all forces have issues around the same sort of i
defaultncident
defaults
default (ABH v Common Assault, Criminal Damage v Burglary and mobile phone theft) I still feel that a reasonable amount of confidence can remain in the crime statistics.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultNo, t

defaultshould be

defaultT
defaulthe results of the HMIC inspection of all forces will provide an indication as to whether or not the recorded crime statistics can be accredited - however that will 
defaultbe indicative for the future of the audit
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe move to the ONS seemed a step forward and will allow the data to be maintained by a department that is free from any internal or external pressures. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultCombination with the British Crime Survey results
default should provide the desired information.
