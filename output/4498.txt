[[[Highway Code in regards to cycling]]]https://www.gov.uk/highway-code&#xa0;In May 2013 the CTC voted for my motion seeking changes to the Highway Code, to improve safety and benefit cyclists (vote 2665 for, 7 against, referhttp://www.ctc.org.uk/sites/default/files/ersvotingreport2013.pdfhttp://www.ctc.org.uk/file/Public/agmagenda.pdf

[[[ ]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;Suggestions for change;&#xa0;

[[[Introduction]]]

[[[https://www.gov.uk/highway-code/introduction]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The 

[[[Introduction to the Highway Code]]] includes: “Although failure to comply with the other rules of The Highway Code will not, in itself, cause a person to be prosecuted, The Highway Code may be used in evidence in any court proceedings under the Traffic Acts (see The road user and the law) to establish liability. This includes rules which use advisory wording such as ‘should/should not’ or ‘do/do not’.” https://www.gov.uk/highway-code/introduction &#xa0;For cyclists this can create a problem in that the Code uses the word ‘should’ when applied to advice on what to wear, Rule 59, see below. For pedestrians the word ‘should’ is not used. &#xa0;Advice for pedestrians states;  (https://www.gov.uk/rules-pedestrians-1-to-35 )Rule 3

[[[Help other road users to see you.]]] Wear or carry something light-coloured, bright or fluorescent in poor daylight conditions. When it is dark, use reflective materials (e.g. armbands, sashes, waistcoats, jackets, footwear), which can be seen by drivers using headlights up to three times as far away as non-reflective materials.” &#xa0;In practice compensation is sometimes reduced for people cycling due to not wearing extra safety aids and pedestrians usually gain full compensation.&#xa0;To provide for fair compensation and support people’s right to wear their normal clothing, the following changes are suggested. &#xa0;Adding a sentence to the ‘

[[[Introduction]]]’,“However, liability should not be based on wearing extra safety aids in the case of pedestrians and cyclists.” and revising Rule 59 as below.&#xa0;

[[[Rule 59 ]]]https://www.gov.uk/rules-for-cyclists-59-to-82Current version shown in Italics&#xa0;Clothing. You should wearandrewording Rule 59, could provide the framework for social equality.Clothing.&#xa0;The advice to wear a helmet was added to the Code in 1993 when evidence was still being collected and it was premature. In 2013 there is evidence for and against promoting their use, from both safety and social perspectives. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Rule 163]]] – suggested changeshttps://www.gov.uk/using-the-road-159-to-203&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;‘pass vulnerable road users with extra care and generous clearance’&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Rule 213]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[– ]]]suggested changeshttps://www.gov.uk/road-users-requiring-extra-care-204-to-225/motorcyclists-and-cyclists-211-to-213

[[[&#xa0;]]]Take extra care passing cyclists, preferably leave 1.5m or more but at least a minimum passing distance of one metre between the motor vehicle and a bicyclist for speeds up to 30 mph. At higher speeds more space should be provided and sufficient to prevent contact with the person operating the bicycle if the person were to fall into the driver’s lane of traffic. Pass with care and not at excessive speed.&#xa0;

[[[Rule 2]]]

[[[39]]]Parking (239 to 247) https://www.gov.uk/waiting-and-parking/parking-239-to-247includes;‘you 

[[[MUST]]] ensure you do not hit anyone when you open your door. Check for cyclists or other traffic’ &#xa0;A separate rule rather than including in ‘Parking’ would give more emphasis, ‘General rules section could be used. People opening doors and causing accidents result in deaths and serious injury to cyclists. &#xa0;New Rule – suggested wording;

[[[Opening doors ]]]

[[[safely]]]A person 

[[[MUST NOT]]] cause a hazard to any person or vehicle by opening a door of a vehicle, leaving a door of a vehicle open, or getting off, or out of, a vehicle. Check for cyclists or other trafficMaximum penalty— 6 penalty points&#xa0;Plus an enlarged picture illustrating the dangers of opening a car door could be providedA link to rule 239 could be added.&#xa0;

[[[Tailgating]]] HGV type vehicles are required to leave at least a 2 seconds gap from the vehicle in front on all types of roads. Note, this allows for a better view on the inside area where cyclists are likely to be.The above suggestions for the Introduction, rules 59, 163, 213 and 239 plus new Rules could result in fewer accidents. A number of other measures could be introduced as part of a road safety bill, see below, Appendix A. 

[[[Part 2]]]

[[[Design standards for cycling infrastructure ]]]The UK provides design guidelines and DfT issue guidance. These do not generally result in high quality consistent standards for infrastructure and in some cases engineers will not provide cycling facilities at all or provide sub guidelines recommendations or not follow the guidelines. A new approach is needed based on standards that form the minimum requirement for cycling infrastructure. One standard already in use in Victoria, Australia, ‘Design standards for bicycle facilities’, they provide  'Cycle Notes', a series of 21 information bulletins on design standards for cycling infrastructure.http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/Home/Moreinfoandservices/Bicycles/StrategicDirectionsForCycling/BicycleFacilityDesignStandards.htmThe detail design of infrastructure for cycling is an important safety aspect and guidelines are not adequate to meet the needs required. The aim is for the ‘standards’ to direct the design engineers to what is required for best practice and reduce their design time and costs. The Netherlands also provide high design standards and a UK ‘Design standards’ would need to apply best practice such as CROW when possible, for more information refer http://www.cycling-embassy.org.uk/wiki/dutch-cycle-infrastructure . &#xa0;

[[[Part 3]]]

[[[General road safety improvements and consequ]]]

[[[ences for cycling]]]If Parliament passed a Cycling Promotion and Road Safety Bill, (see Appendix A for details) this would show that Parliament was sending a strong message to improve safety for cycling. In Wales they had a consultation on cycling and this may help to improve safety, see; http://wales.gov.uk/consultations/transport/activetravelbill/?lang=en&#xa0;Roads in UK cities have developed over centuries and were not designed for large HGV type vehicles. Delivery of goods to inner cities should be limited to using vehicles of about 2m wide and 8m long as a general rule for a maximum size. One examples of a vehicles near to being suitable is the MWB Hi-Roof Van at 1.9m wide and 5.7m long can carry 1300 kg.  http://www.rabbitsvehiclehire.co.uk/vehicle/mwb-hi-roof-van/ &#xa0;This would provide for more passing clearance for cyclists and reduce the risk when turning. It would also benefit general traffic flow. If some larger vehicles gained permission then some restrictions on not delivering during peak traffic hours could be required. &#xa0;

[[[Part 4]]]

[[[O]]]

[[[verseeing changes without undue delays]]]A ‘Cycling Minister’ with just cycling to focus on may be the best approach and reporting to the Cabinet. Funding for urban areas and rural locations, e.g. e.g. designing safer junctions and provisions for crossing ‘A’ roads would require a higher level of short term funding. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Part 5]]]

[[[Measuring results and effects]]]The short and long term effects would need evaluating. Measuring passing clearances to see if on average a lower proportion of drivers pass too close. If a change in driving culture occurs with more consideration given to cyclists would need assessing. Accident data for all road users can be evaluated against the trends. &#xa0;

[[[Appendix A]]]

[[[Proposed, Cycling Promotion and Road Safety Bill]]]

[[[Aims -]]]1 Promote a cycling consciousness that reflects in safer driver’s behaviour. 2 To reduce conflicts between all road users and improve road safety.3 Develop quality cycling infrastructure and junction designs/provisions.4 Improve cycling networks across England and Wales.5 Create jobs and encourage extra visitors.6 Increase the combined use of cycling and public transport.7 Reduce traffic pollution by more people cycling and reduced speed limits.8 Improve health by more people cycling more often.9 Improve cycling safety by ‘Safety in Numbers’ 

[[[Contents]]]

[[[1]]]

[[[Standard of cycling infrastructure]]]1.1 A revised standard for cycling provisions and infrastructure shall be provided.1.2 Cycling infrastructure and provisions shall be maintained and repaired so that they are safe and fit for purpose.

[[[2]]]

[[[Making the road environment more suitable for cycling]]]To reduce cyclists feeling squeezed or threatened by motorised traffic, the following provisions shall be introduced;2.1 No overtaking of cyclists shall be permitted at the pedestrian refuge or crossing or for a distance of 10m either side of the refuge or crossing.2.2 Separate bypass cycle lane shall be provided at refuges if possible.

[[[3]]]

[[[Passing clearance and speed restriction for motor vehicles passing cyclists.]]]3.1 Refer proposed Highway Code changes above.3.2 On narrow roads, 5 m or less in width, the permitted maximum motor vehicle speed is 20 mph when passing cyclists. 

[[[4]]]

[[[Ma]]]

[[[ximum Speed limits]]]4.1To reduce deaths and serious injuries and improve road safety for all road users the following speed limits shall apply unless signed otherwise. Motorways refer present Code‘A’ roads dual carriageways 60 or 70 mph, depending on risk level and if provided with separate cycle paths.‘A’ roads dual carriageways 60 mph, if not provided with separate cycle paths.‘A’ roads single carriageways 60 mph, if provided with separate cycle paths. ‘A’ roads single carriageways 50 mph, if not provided with separate cycle paths. Rural roads with centre lines and a minimum width of 6m and good sight lines, 50 mph. Rural roads without centre lines 40 mph.Urban roads 40 mph, 30 mph, 25 mph and 20 mph limits to suit the situation. &#xa0;Notes4AThe 25 mph limit compared with the 30 mph roughly halves the fatality risk, see pages 12 Fig 4, 13 Fig 5, (40 km/hr v 50km/hr).http://www.monash.edu.au/miri/research/reports/muarc276.pdf Probability of death reduces from about 0.65 at 30 mph (50 km/hr) to 0.3 at 25 mph (40 km/hr). http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/road_traffic/world_report/speed_en.pdfMany roads in urban areas are suited to 25 mph limits rather than 30 mph limits. &#xa0;4BThe GB accident data for 2011 shows 979 deaths in non-built up areas compared with 816 for built up areas. Most deaths occurred on ‘A’ roads. For cycling ‘A’ roads pose a high risk and changes are needed urgently. The above suggestions could help lower the number killed and relate directly to the provision of cycling infrastructure.

[[[5]]]

[[[Junction layout and design]]]5.1 Road junctions need to be rated for risk to cyclists, starting with ‘A’ roads. Staggered junctions are often used by cyclists to cross major roads and many improvements are required.

[[[6]]]

[[[Funding of cycling infrastructure and general provision for cycling]]]6.1 Long term funding at a rate of £10 per person (index linked) or three percent of the transport budget to be provided for cycling facilities. Short term extra funding to assist.

[[[7]]]

[[[Lower drink drive limit]]]7.1 To reduce the permitted blood alcohol level for drivers from 80 mg per 100 ml of blood to 50 mg.7.2 Zero blood alcohol limits for young drivers. &#xa0;Note7Ahttp://www.nice.org.uk/media/3FE/1A/Blo ... Review.pdfThere is strong evidence that someone’s ability to drive is affected if they have any alcohol in their blood. Drivers with a BAC of between 0.02 and 0.05 have at least a three times greater risk of dying in a vehicle crash. This risk increases to at least six times with a BAC between 0.05 and 0.08.&#xa0;7Bhttp://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/conten ... 1.full.pdf (USA report)Studies show a 3 to 17 fold increased risk of a fatal MVC with BAC &lt; 0.08 g/dl compared to sober drivers.(17 factor for 16-20 age group).

[[[8]]]Amended the arrangements for changing the clocks in the winter and summer.referhttp://www.publications.parliament.uk/p ... 65/665.pdf page 10.The Department has strong evidence that more than80 fewer people would be killed each year on Great Britain’s roads if the Governmentamended the arrangements for changing the clocks in the winter and summer.

[[[Notes]]]

[[[ on costs;]]]

[[[Congestion]]]The Department for Transport's (DfT's) estimated that the cost of congestion to business is set to rise by £10-12 billion over the period from 2003 to 2025 (expressed in 2002 prices). Adding in the value of the lost time experienced by other travellers raises this figure to £23-24 billion per annum.[2] Cutting congestion in towns and cities by more people cycling, assume 33% more, could result in more than £0.5 billion in savings as a guide estimate.http://www.publications.parliament.uk/p ... /87204.htm

[[[Health]]]“Take obesity: it already costs our NHS a staggering £4 billion a year. But within four years, that figure’s expected to rise to £6.3 billion.” David Cameron, 16 May 2011.Obesity cost approximately £66 per person and expected to increase to about £100 per year.  Potential savings by more cycling could be approximately £1 billion per year. http://fullfact.org/factchecks/NHS_refo ... ealth-2732

[[[Tourism]]]Internationally, 12 % of Germans cycle to work, 27% Netherlands, 18% Denmark, 80+milion people in the USA have bicycles. The UK cycling to work rate is about 1%-2% but in some cities is much higher. The UK travel credit £19 billion compares with a debit of £32 billion. Loss approximately, £13 billion per year, average approximately £200+ per person. Providing more and better cycling facilities and improved road safety measures would result in more visitors and more people cycling within the UK. Potentially from a transfer of 0.5% (1 in 200) in extra visitors to the UK and a reduced level of travellers overseas, a net benefit to the UK could be approximately £255 million per year. Annual saving for UK, approximately £255 million per year.

[[[Fuel ]]]

[[[and accident savings]]]Many motor vehicle journeys are less than 3 miles and by more people cycling, savings could be made of potentially £1 billion per year. A depressingly high proportion of short trips are made by car, 23% under a mile, 33% 1 – 2 miles, and 79% 2 – 5 miles. Refer http://www.sustrans.org.uk/assets/files ... s%2016.pdf 

[[[ ]]]Reduced accidents to cyclists and all road users could potentially save £1 billion per year. http://www.roadsafe.com/news/article.aspx?article=1317

[[[Job creation]]]http://www.bikeleague.org/resources/rep ... _Dec20.pdfThe link provides estimates of 14 jobs per million dollar spent - about 20 per million pounds. Tourism jobs would add to these numbers. Estimating at 25 jobs per million pounds and £10 per person would result in 15000 extra jobs being created. 

[[[Summary of costs]]]Potential savings from a ‘Cycling Promotion and Road Safety Bill’ could be more than £3 billion per year compared with an estimated cost of £0.6 billion per year. Over a 10 year period a net return of £24 billion appears possible.
