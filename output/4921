default are 
defaultnow 
defaultfrequently confronted with arguments based on the EU 
defaultCharter and 
defaulttherefore 
defaulthave no choice but to 
defaultwork with

defaultAlthough it is stated time and again that 
defaultthe Charter

defaultnonetheless, this swiftly accumulating 
defaultcase law 
defaultis a bold testament to 
defaultthe difference 
defaultthat

default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis written evidence considers 3 particular issues, namely:
defaultA. 
defaultDoes the UK/Pol
defaultand Protocol function as an opt-
defaultout 
defaultfrom
default the EU Charter?
defaultB. 
defaultThe application of the Charter in and to the UK
defaultC.
default 
defaultThe extent to which the Charter is being applied horizontally between private individuals and bodies
default&#xa0;
defaultEach of these issues raises complex, technical and tricky issues of law, where there are sometimes no clear answers.
default However, a very terse summary of my conclusions would be the following:
defaultA. 
defaultThe
default Protocol does not generally function as an opt-out
defaultB. The application of the Charter is quite complicated, but recent CJEU 
defaultcaselaw
default has given a very broad interpretation of when the Charter is applicable in member states
defaultC. The Charter has been
default,
default and will continue to be
default,
default applied horizontally between private parties both by the European Court and the national courts, although we must take care to define what we mean by ‘operate horizontally,’ as this is not necessarily the same as giving rise to directly enforceable rights.

default1. defaultIntroductiondefaultIn 
defaultR (AB) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
default [2013] 
defaultMostyn
default J stated
default (
defaultpara
default. 10 of the judgment) –
default‘ . . . I was sure that the British government . . . had secured at the negotiations of the Lisbon Treaty an opt-out from the incorporation of the Charter into EU law and thereby via operation of the European Communities Act 1972 directly into our domestic law.’
default However 
defaultMostyn
default J continued at paragraph 14 to state that, as a result of the judgement of the European Court of Justice in 
defaultN. S. v Secretary of State for the Home Department
default [2011] ‘Notwithstanding the endeavours of our political representatives at Lisbon it would seem that the much wider Charter of Rights is now part of our domestic law.’ 
default   This 
defaultparticular statement 
defaulthas 
defaulthelped to reignite
default the
default debate as to whether Protocol 
defaultNo
default 30 on the a
defaultpplication of the Charter of Fundamental Rights to Poland and to the 
defaultUK 
defaultfunctions to exclude the application of the EU Charter within the UK.
default   
defaultMostyn
default J’s comments were themse
defaultlves surprising to those 
defaultof us 
defaultwho
default never believed that the UK had secured an opt-out from the operations of the Charter. 
defaultFor example, the House of Commons Select Committee on European Scrutiny
default,
default Third Report
default 2007
default,
default stated clearly at paragraph 38:
default 
default‘
defaultIt is clear that the Government accepts that the Charter will be legally binding, and it has stated that the Protocol is
default 
defaultnot an opt-out. Since the Protocol is to operate subject to the UK's obligations under the Treaties, it still seems doubtful
default 
defaultto us that the Protocol has the effect that the courts of this country will not be bound by interpretations of measures of
default 
defaultUnion law given by the ECJ and based on the Charter.
default’ 
defaultIn the 2012 case of 
defaultRugby Football Union v Consolidated Information Services 
defaultthe UK Supreme Court confirmed at 
defaultparas
default. 26-28 that the Charter 
defaulttakes 
defaulteffect in national law, ‘
defaultbinding member states wh
defaulten they are implementing EU law’
default.
default  
default 
default 
defaultFurther, if the Protocol were to operate as an effective opt-out then this would cast doubt 
defaulton 
defaultthe wording of various recitals of the Preamble to the Protocol which seem to assume 
defaultthe applicability of the Charter in the UK
default,
default and give the impression that the Protocol is a clarifying exercise 
defaulteg
default (bold highlighting added)
default:
default‘WHEREAS the aforementioned Article 6 requires the Charter to be applied and interpreted by the courts of Poland and of the United Kingdom strictly in accordance with the explanations referred to in that Article, . . .
defaultWHEREAS the Charter reaffirms the rights, freedoms and principles recognised in the Union and makes those rights more visible, but does not create new rights or 
defaultprinciples, . . .
defaultNOTING the wish of Poland and the United Kingdom to 
defaultclarify defaultcertain aspects of the application of the Charter,
defaultDESIROUS therefore of 
defaultclarifyingdefault the application of the Charter in relation to the laws and administrative action of Poland and of the United Kingdom and of its 
defaultjusticiability
default within Polan
defaultd and within the United Kingdom . . .’
default   Such an interpretation is confirmed b
defaulty the judgment of the European C
defaultourt of Justice 
default(CJEU) 
defaultin the 2011 
defaultNS
default case, in which the Advocate General held (at 
defaultpara
default 167): ‘the question whether Protocol No 30 is to be regarded as a general opt-out from the Charter of Fundamental Rights for the United Kingdom and the Republic of Poland can be easily answered in the negative,
default’ and the 
defaultCJ
defaultEU
default held (at 
defaultpara
default 119): ‘ ... Protocol (No 30) does not call into question the applicability of the Charter in the United Kingdom or in Poland, a position which is confirmed by the recitals in the preamble to that protocol.’
default   
defaultHowever, even if the Protocol does not operate as an opt-out overall, this does not mean that it may have no impact whatever on the application of the Charter within the UK. In particular, the wording of Art 1(2) of the Protocol may have lessened the application of Title IV (Solidarity) provisions within the UK. So i
defaultt 
defaultis necessary 
defaultto consider each of the provisions of Protocol no 30 in turn. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.default 
defaultArticle 1 (1)default Protocoldefault‘
defaultThe Charter does not extend the ability of the Court of Justice of the European Union, or any court or tribunal of Poland or of the United Kingdom, to find that the laws, regulations or administrative provisions, practices or action of Poland or of the United Kingdom are inconsistent with the fundamental rights, freedoms and principles that it reaffirms.
default’
defaultThe crucial words 
defaultare 
default‘does not extend the ability.’ According to Art 1(1) 
defaultProtocol, 
defaultthe Charter provides no new competences for the EU but it does not limit any existing EU competences. 
defaultThis position is also substantiated by Article 51(2) Charter which states:
default‘The Charter does not extend the field of application of Union law beyond the powers of the Union or establish any new power or task for the Union, or modify powers and tasks as defined in the Treaties.’
defaultThe 
defaultCJEU
default 
defaulthas long had the power to find national laws 
defaultthat 
defaultfall within the scope of EU law inconsistent with EU fundamental rights law. 
defaultIn the
defaultse circumstances, Article 1(1) Protocol does not exempt the 
defaultUK 
defaultfrom the obligation to comply with the Charter or prevent a 
defaultUK 
defaultcourt from ensuring compliance with
default the Charter
default.
defaultA final point to be made here is that Art 1(2) Protocol, d
defaulti
defaults
defaultc
defaultussed 
defaultimmediately 
defaultbelow, would appear to be redundant, if 
defaultArt 1(1) had in fact succee
defaultd
defaulted in creating a general opt
default–out.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3default. defaultArticle 1(2) defaultProtocoldefault:default‘In particular, and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in Title IV of the Charter creates 
defaultjusticiable
default rights applicable to Poland or the United Kingdom except in so far as Poland or the United Kingdom has provided for such rights in its national law.’
defaultTitle IV of the
default Charter concern rights of Solidarity
default and 
defaultcovers 
defaultArts 27-38 Charter. 
defaultIt contains
default,
default for example
default,
default Art 30 ‘Protection in the event of unjustified dismissal’ and Art 
default28 on 
defaultthe right to collective bargaining, ‘including strike action’. These rights were of particular concern to the UK 
default(
defaultthere is no explicit right to strike under UK 
defaultdomestic 
defaultlaw
default)
default. 
defaultIf any part of Protocol 30 is 
defaultcapable
default of functioning as an ‘opt-out’ then it is
default,
default surely, Art 1(2). But can it function in this way?
default&#xa0;
default3.default1default 
defaultNo clear CJEU authority yet on status of Art 1(2) Protocol
defaultTo date, there is no clear authority on the status of Art 1(2) from the CJEU. In the 
defaultNS 
defaultcase, the CJEU held that ‘Since the rights referred to in the cases in the main proceedings do not form part of Title IV of the Charter, there is no need to rule on the interpretation of Article 1(2) of Protocol (No 30).’
default   However, Advocate General 
defaultTrstenjak
default, in 
defaultNS
default, while remarking that Title IV was not at issue in the 
defaultNS
default case, did consider what might be the implications for Art 1(2) Protocol, noting (in 
defaultpara
default 173 of her Opinion) that: 
default‘With the statement that Title IV of the Charter of Fundamental Rights does not create 
defaultjusticiable
default rights applicable to Poland or the United Kingdom, Article 1(2) of Protocol No 30 first reaffirms the principle, set out in Article 51(1) of the Charter, that the Charter does not create 
defaultjusticiable
default rights as between private individuals.
default   However, Article 1(2) of Protocol No 30 also appears to rule out new EU rights and entitlements being derived from Articles 27 to 38 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, on which those entitled could rely against the United Kingdom or against Poland.’ 
default   With respect, the first sentence of 
defaultpara
default 173 of her 
defaultOpinion 
defaultis puzzling, given that Art 51(1) Charter is not limited to claims between private individuals. However, the second part of 
defaultpara
default 173 seems to me to be a more accurate statement of the law, although must be regarded in English legal terms as merely ‘obiter’ given that those rights were not at issue in the 
defaultNS 
defaultcase itself.
default&#xa0;
default3.default2default 
defaultThe distinction between rights and princi
defaultples
defaultArt 1(2) should be read in line with Art 52(5) of the Charter itself, which states:
defaultArt 52(5) 
default‘The provisions of this Charter which contain principles may be implemented by legislative and executive acts taken by institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union, and by acts of Member States when they are implementing Union law, in the exercise of their respective powers. They shall be judicially 
defaultcognizable
default only in the interpretation of such acts and in the ruling on their legality.’ 
defaultIn this way, those rights 
defaultdesignated 
default‘principles’ are deemed incapable of creating directly enforceable rights. 
defaultIt is often suggested that
default ‘principles’ refer to economic, social and cultural rights, and Art 52(5) reflects the desire of 
defaultat least some of 
defaultthe Charter’s drafters 
defaultto ensure that socio-economic rights would not be directly in enforceable in courts. 
default   
defaultMany commentators on
default the Protocol have suggested that Art 1(2) merely confirms the distinction between rights and principles in Art 52(5). The problem, however, is that Article 52(5) does not clearly distinguish which provisions are to be interpreted as ‘ri
defaultghts’ and which as ‘principles’
default, although in fact only three provisions in the Charter explicitly use the word ‘principle’ – Art 23 (principle of equality between men and women); Art 37 (sustainable development) and Art 47 (proportionality and legality of criminal offences). The 
defaultOfficial 
defaultExplanations 
defaultto the Charter 
defaultare not of great help, especially as they note that some Articles may contain both rights and principles – 
defaulteg
default Arts 23, 33 and 34. Theref
defaulto
defaultre, it 
defaultcannot 
defaultbe said with certainty that Title IV contains only principles. So the distinction be
defaulttw
defaulteen rights and principles does not work as an adequate explan
defaulta
defaulttion of Art 1(2) Protocol, although it does appear to confirm that those provisions in Title IV 
defaultthat 
defaultare 
defaultprinciples
default,
default are not 
defaultjusticiable
default. But this would be the case anyway under the Charter. 
default&#xa0;
default3.2default 
defaultDoes Art 1(2) render Title IV 
defaultrightsdefault non 
defaultjusticiable
default?
defaultHowever, 
defaultan important question is whether 
defaultArt 1(2) 
defaultmight 
defaultreach beyond Art 52(5) Charter and succeed in establ
defaultishing that even provisions of Title IV which are classified
default 
defaultas 
defaultrights
default are not 
defaultjusticiable
default 
defaultunless the UK has provided for them in national law
default?
default For example, the 
defaultArt 28 right of collective barga
defaultining and strike action 
defaultpresents itself as a right not a principle, but it could be argued that the effect of Art 1(2) Protocol is to ensure that it
default i
defaults not 
defaultjusticiable
default. 
defaultHowever, Ar
defaultt
default 28 
defaultCharter 
defaultitself provides that workers have these rights ‘in accordance with Union law and national laws and practices’. UK law only permits strikes under limited conditions, 
defaultand 
defaultthere is no ‘
defaultright
default to strike’ as such. So it would appear that
default,
default even according to the provisions of the Charter itself, the right must be grounded in national law and practices
default, 
defaultso Art 1(2) adds little in this case
default. 
default&#xa0;
default3.3default 
defaultGeneral Principles of law operate in any case
defaultIn any case, the possibility for Art 1(2) to function as an effective opt-out for the UK from socio-economic rights is further limited by the fact that, even were 
defaultall of 
defaultTitle IV itself to be
default unenforceable in the UK
default, the UK would be still bound by EU fundamental rights law in these areas. This is because, according to Art 6(3) TEU, 
default‘
defaultFundamental rights, as guaranteed by the ECHR and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, shall constitute general principles of the Union’s law
default’ and the Protocol does not apply to general principles of law.

default in which
default it was held that respect for fundamental rights forms part of the general principles of law protected by the Court. 
default&#xa0;
default3.4default 
defaultBut do Charter rights extend beyond general principles of law?
defaultArt 1(2) 
defaultProtocol 
defaultwould only be of significance if the rights in the Charter went beyond those recognised as general principles of law. But, although as 
defaultMostyn
default J rightly pointed out in the 
defaultAB
default case, the Charter extends well beyond those ECHR rights enforced through the UK Human Rights Act, it is still the case that the Charter draws on those rights that were already recognised in EU law, as the official Explanations make clear. The Explanations set out the source
defaults
default for all of the Charter rights. In the case of the T
defaulti
defaulttle IV rights, many of these are sourced from 
defaultthe Council of Europe European Social Charter and the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers. The European Social Charter is a treaty which is 
defaultbinding
default on those that have ratified it 
default(which includes the UK). 
defaultIn contrast, the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers is not 
defaultbinding
default but a political declaration only
default, although many of its obligations have been enforced by other texts, such as EU 
defaultdirectives
default.
default 
default   
defaultHowever, neither the European Social Charter, nor the Community Charter might be seen as binding in the sense of ‘directly effective’, 
defaultor directly enforceable in a court of law, 
defaultso unless a further source for the right in question could be 
defaultfound  –
default for example in an EU directive, or a judgement of the
default CJEU
default, then an attempt to render these rights directly effective in national law, could be seen as going further than existing practice and introducing new rights in the UK.
default An example here might be the right to a placement service in Art 29 Charter, which is expressed as a right, not a principle, 
defaultand 
defaulthas a prior source in the European Social Charter and the Community Charter
default. In such as case, Art 1(2) Protocol might operate in what has been described as a ‘belt and braces’ fashion, to ensure that Art 29 cannot be directly effective in the UK.

default&#xa0;
defaultThis provision does not appear to offer very much new. It seems merely to underline Art 52(6) 
defaultCharter 
defaultwhich states: 
default‘Full account shall be taken of national laws and practices as specified in this Charter’.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4. ConclusiondefaultThe Protocol, with the possible exception of Art 1(2), and that to a limited extent only, does not function as an opt-out.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultB. THE APPLICATION OF THE CHARTER IN AND TO THE UKdefault&#xa0;default1.default 
defaultGiven that Protocol 30 does not function as an opt-out for the UK (except 
defaultperhaps 
defaultto a limited extent for Art 1(2) Protocol) it will be crucial to know 
defaultexactly 
defaultwhen the Charter applies in the UK.
default   
defaultThe Charter is not an instrument of limitless general review – Article 51(1) of the Charter specifies that it is ‘addressed to the institutions… of the Union… and to the 
defaultMember States only when they are implementing Union law’
default (italics added).
default This, in turn, begs the question of what exactly is covered by member states in the act of implementing EU law.
default&#xa0;
default2.default 
defaultThe meaning ofdefault ‘implementing Union law’defaultThe term ‘implementing’ might seem to imply some sort of delimitation of the Charter, rendering it applicable only in situations where
default,
default for example, 
defaultthe UK 
defaultis implementing an EU directive. 
defaultIndeed the use of ‘implementing’ in Article 51(1) may suggest the intention of its drafters to reduce the 
defaultCJEU’s 
defaultscope of review of national measures on fundamental rights grounds, from the 
defaultexpansive
default reading given by the Court in its pre-Lisbon case law. 
defaultIndeed, t
defaulthe Convention 
defaultdrafting the Charter actually 
defaultrejected a
defaultn earlier
default 
defaultPraesidium
default drafting proposal 
defaultdesigned to bind Member States ‘
defaultwhen acting within the scope of Union law
default’
default.
default 
default    
defaultHowever, this situation is further complicated by the Charter’s
default Official Explanations
default, whi
defaultch indicate
default that the Charter is ‘binding on Member States when they act 
defaultin the scope
default of Union law’
default and cite previous 
defaultcaselaw
default of the CJEU to that effect. 
default   
defaultThis phraseology is certainly broader tha
defaultn that of ‘implementing’ EU law.
default In 
defaultR (
defaultZagorski
default) v Secretary of State for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills 
default[2010] 
defaultparas
default 66-71, the English High Court held that a member State derogating from EU law was acting within the scope of EU law for the purposes of the Charter. In 
defaultN.S.
default, 
defaultthe CJEU 
defaultheld that, in deciding an asylum application on whether an applicant should be returned to Greece under EU Regulation 343/2003, the EU was implementing EU law, and fell within the scope of the Charter. 
default&#xa0;
default2.1default The CJEU 
defaultÅkerberg
default 
defaultFransson
default 
defaultruling of 2013
defaultWhile there were some attempts for a narrower understanding of the phrase ‘implementing Union law’ (
defaultfor example 
defaultAG Cruz 
defaultVillalón
default in 
defaultFransson
default, 
defaultsee further below) 
defaultthe 
defaultCJ
defaultEU
default itself in 
defaultthe highly important 2013 
defaultÅkerberg
default 
defaultFransson
default 
defaultcase 
defaultpreferred a wider reading of the
default phrase
default, holding at 
defaultpara
default 21 that ‘
defaultthe fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter must therefore be complied with where national legislation falls within the scope of European Union law
default’.
default   
defaultThe breadth 
defaultand implications 
defaultof this ruling can be seen more clearly if we look more closely at the facts of 
defaultÅkerberg
default 
defaultFransson
default 
defaultitself, which concerned tax law
default. 
default   
defaultIn 
defaultÅkerberg
default 
defaultFransson
default, the Swedish referring court asked the CJEU whether the principle of double jeopardy, in Art 50 Charter, was relevant to the case at hand and could be used to set aside domestic law. 
defaultFransson
default had 
defaultprovided false information to the revenue authorities, 
defaultand had already 
defaultincur
defaultred
default an administrative penalty, but could additionally face criminal prosecution for the same misconduct. The Swedish court was uncertain whether the Charter applied, as it was unclear whether the Swedish dual system of tax penalties fell within the ‘implementation of Union law,’ as required by Art. 
default51(1) Charter.
default However, EU law 
defaultwas 
defaultat least 
defaultof 
defaultsome relevance 
defaultin
default 
defaultthat Directive 2006/112
default entitles States to ‘impose other obligations 
defaultwhich they deem necessary to ensure the correct collection of VAT and to prevent evasion.’ 
defaultWas this sufficient to bring the Swedish tax law within the scope of the Charter?
default    
defaultAdvocate General Cruz 
defaultVillalón
default 
defaultthought not. He had suggested that the 
defaultcontrolling
default consideration
default 
defaultshould be whether the EU had 
defaulta ‘specific interest’ 
defaultin centralizing
default human 
defaultrights review of 
defaultthe 
defaultmeasures. 
defaultHe argued that 
defaultargued that ‘[t]he mere fact that such an exercise of public authority has its ultimate origin in Union law is not of itself sufficient for a finding that there is a situation involving the implementation of Union law’ 
defaultand he 
defaultconsidered 
defaultthe link between the EU legislation and the Swedish measures too tenuous. 
default   
defaultThe CJEU
default decided the issue differently
default. It ignored the AG’s 
defaultargument requiring a specific 
defaultEU
default interest, and
default instead re
defaultpeated
default its former 
defaultcaselaw
default, 
defaultrequiring 
defaultdomestic acts 
defaultto 
defaultcomply with EU law when they fall within the scope 
defaultof EU law
default. 
defaultIt highlighted that 
defaultprovisions of EU law require member states to 
defaultcollect VAT and
default prevent VAT evasion
default,
default and noted that any shortcoming in the domestic collecti
defaulton of VAT affects the EU budget, and so, even if 
defaultthe Swedish legislation was not designed to transpose Directive 2006/112, its application penalise
defaultd
default the
default infringement of that directive
default and, 
defaulta
defaults a result, the Charter applied.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.2default 
defaultThe Response
default to the CJEU ruling in 
defaultÅkerberg
default 
defaultFransson
default   
defaultPerhaps understandably, 
defaultÅkerberg
default 
defaultFransson
default 
defaulthas
default not been universally welcomed
default, given that it allows a broad interpretation of the CJEU’s competences, thus enabling EU fundamental rights to apply in a potentially wide range of cases that appear to go beyond the literal wording of Art 51. Interestingly, 
defaultÅkerberg
default 
defaultFransson
default 
defaulthas also been subject to criticism by the German 
defaultConstitutional Court. 
defaultIn a 
default2013 
defaultjudgment (24.
default April 2013 1 
defaultBvR
default 1215/07) concerning a counter-terrorism database, the 
defaultGerman Court 
defaultinsisted that the case 
defaultbefore it 
defaultwas clearly outside the scope of the Ch
defaultarter, as it pursued national 
defaultobjectives with only a possible ‘indirect’ effect on the functioning of legal relationships under EU law. Such a statement would 
defaultsurely 
defaultbe superfluous if the German Court were not wary of the possibility of a wide reading of the scope of the Charter by the CJEU. The 
defaultGerman Court 
defaultcontinued:
default‘
defaultThe Senate acts on the assumption that the statements in the ECJ’s 
default(
defaultÅkerberg
default) 
defaultdecision are based on the distinctive features of the law on
default VAT
default, and express no general view.’
default 
default(Press release no. 31/2013 of 24 April 2013, 
default1 
defaultBvR
default 1215/07
default)
default.
default 
defaultThis looks like quite a clear warning to the CJEU
default, and an attempt to confine the implications of 
defaultÅkerberg
default to tax law – an approach not adopted however 
defaultb
defaulty the CJEU itself
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.3default 
defaultThe breadth of the CJEU understanding of ‘the scope of EU law’
defaultIndeed, the wide reading of the scope of the Charter in 
defaultÅkerberg
default does not signify a new approach for the CJEU. It has been interpreting the scope of EU law in fundamental rights matters widely for a number of years. As well as the cases cited in the
default Official E
defaultxplanations, and by the CJEU in the 
defaultÅkerberg
default case, an earlier case on fundamental rights nicely illustrates this. In the 
defaultMary Carpenter
default 
default[2002] 
defaultcase, which predates
default the 
defaultbinding
default Charter, Mrs Carpenter, a 
defaultFilippino
default national, challenged her proposed 
defaultdeportation
default from the UK 
default(
defaultthe 
defaultofficial 
defaultgrounds 
defaultfor her deportation were
default certain violations of immigration law on her part
default)
default. 
defaultThis looked to be a purely domestic case, turning on national immigration law. However, 
defaultCarpenter
default argued that she derived EU law rights through her husband, a British national. Spouses of European nationals 
defaultnormally 
defaultderive EU rights only when they move to another country, not in the country of origin, and so 
defaultit might 
defaulthave 
defaultbeen 
defaultassumed 
defaultthat 
defaultthis was purely internal situation. However, the Court found in her favour. It stated that, 
defaultfirst,
default Mr Carpenter was engaged in 
defaultproviding services to other Member States’ nationals as a ‘significan
defaultt proportion of his business’. Yet, t
defaulthe link between Mrs Carpenter’s situation and EU law was extremely tenuous. Neither she nor her husband had moved to another EU state. Nevertheless, EU law applied and human rights standards were invoked.

defaultThe shape of things to come?default defaultA ‘federalizing’ EU Charter of Rights?defaultCases such as 
defaultCarpenter
default and 
defaultÅkerberg
default 
defaultillustrate the wide potential reach of EU law. Do they set the outer limit for the scope of EU law
default,
default or is there room for even wider interpretations? Here it is 
defaultworth 
defaultconsider
defaulting
default the recent 2011 
defaultRuiz 
defaultZambrano
default 
defaultcase
default,
default 
defaultin which p
defaulterhaps one of the most far reaching suggestions regarding the 
defaultpotential 
defaultscope of EU 
defaultfundamental rights 
defaultlaw was made by AG 
defaultSharpston
default.
default The main issue for determination by the 
defaultCJEU 
defaultwas whether Mr Ruiz 
defaultZambrano
default, a Colombian national, could claim a right of residence in Belgium under EU law following the birth of his children (who were EU citizens) in 2003 and 2005, notwithstanding that his EU citizen children had yet to exercise their right of free movement within the Union, which would normally be a requirement for trigg
defaultering the application of EU law
default.
default   Although most of the discussion in this case turned on EU citizenship, AG 
defaultSharpston
default, in her Opinion, considered the role of fundamental rights in EU law, arguing that their

default 
defaultAG 
defaultSharpston
default did, however, acknowledge that, this was likely to be too bold a step for the Court to take unilaterally at present, but she nonetheless suggested that the Court should consider that the evolution of EU fundamental rights law in the context of the now binding nature of the Charter, and proposed EU accession to the ECHR, might require a more robust scrutiny of fundamental rights. The Court in 
defaultRuiz 
defaultZambrano
default,
default however, did not discuss th
defaultis point
default. 
default   Interestingly, AG 
defaultS
defaultharpston
default also stated that:
default ‘[m]
defaultaking
default the application of EU fundamental rights dependent solely on the existence of exclusive or shared EU competence would involve introducing an overtly federal element into the structure of the EU’s legal and political system. Simply put, a change of the kind would be analogous to that experienced in US constitutional law after the decision in 
defaultGitlow
default v New York
default . . . A change of that kind would alter, in legal and political terms, the very nature of fundamental rights under EU law. It therefore requires both an evolution in the case-law and an unequivocal political statement from the constituent powers of the EU (its Member States), pointing at a new role for fundamental rights in the EU.’

default      AG 
defaultSharpston’s
default reference to US jurisprudence 
defaultmay 
defaultexplain why most national governments were keen to have Art 51(1) inserted in
default the Charter in the first place, namely to avoid a ‘federalizing’ movement in the field of fundamental rights, comparable to that exercised by 
defaultthe US Supreme Court 
defaultwhich, in the earlier 20
defaultth
default century, incorporated
default the 
defaultUS 
defaultfederal Bill of Rights 
defaultand applied them to the states 
defaultthrough 
defaulta very wide 
defaultinterpretation of the 
default14
defaultth
default 
defaultAmendment 
defaultof 
defaultthe US Constitution. 
defaultFor example, 
defaultin the 1925 case of 
defaultGitlow
default v New York
default, 
defaultmentioned by AG 
defaultSharpston
default in her Opinion, 
defaultthe US Supreme Court 
defaultheld that the 
defaultFirst
default 
defaultAmendment
default of the US Federal Bill of Rights may also apply to the States 
defaultth
defaultrough the 
defaultoperation of the 14
defaultth
default 
defaultAmendment (which specifically applies to the states). Since then, the US Supreme Court has applied the federal bill of rights (and its expansive interp
defaultr
defaultetations of those rights) to 
defaultState 
defaultlaws 
defaulteven when the States 
defaultare 
defaultact
defaulting
default within their own sphere of competence.
default 
defaultIn this way
default, the US Supreme Court has 
defaultcreated 
defaulta unified constitutional order 
defaultof 
defaultfundamental rights.
default 
default   It seems clear however, that, at present at least, 
defaultthe Charter 
defaultdoes not permit 
defaultthe 
defaultCJEU 
defaultto 
defaultemulate 
defaultthe US Supreme Court, 
defaultand identify

default    Therefore, h
defaultowever 
defaultwide
default the scope of EU law, there will 
defaultcontinue to 
defaultbe domestic situations in which it cannot be applied. For example, the Supreme Court in 
defaultR (on the application of Chester) v Secretary of State of for Justice; 
defaultMcGeoch
default (AP) v The Lord
default 
defaultPresident of the Council and another
default [2013] UKSC 63 unanimously dismissed two prisoners’ claims that the UK government’s refusal to allow them to vote whilst in prison breached their EU rights
default, on the basis that the case did not fall within the scope of EU law
default.

default&#xa0;
default4default. defaultWho is pdefaultrotected by the EU Charter?default Thedefault defaultPersonaldefault scope of application of the CharterdefaultIn addition to the material scope of EU law – namely, the EU must be acting within the scope of EU law according to 
defaultÅkerberg
default and Art 51 Charter, the applicant must also be able to show that they, personally, are protected by the Charter – or at least this seems to be the import of the UK 
defaultZagorski
default case, discussed below. This point may not be automatically obvious, so it deserves a little further exploration. 
default   
defaultArt 51 Charter states on whom the Charter imposes obligations, but it does not state who 
defaultmay benefit
default from the Charter’s rights. Instead, the EU Charter appears to deal with this
default question on a case-by-case basis. Each provision 
defaultstates 
defaultwho is protected in relation
default 
defaultto the right
default at issue, and this differs from right to right
default. Sometimes protection is given 
defaultonly to EU 
defaultcitizens.
default However
default, 
defaultsome 
defaultrights
default 
defaultand freedoms are 
defaultdesigned 
defaultto be universal and to protect 'everyone', 
defaultmost 
defaultparticular
defaultly
default the rights
default located in 
defaultthe first two Chapters (Dignity, Freedoms).
default 
default   
defaultSo, for example, 
defaultArticle 4 Charter prohibits all forms of torture and inhuman or degrading
default 
defaulttreatment or punishment. 
defaultThis appears to apply universally. 
defaultBut it is not as universal as first impressions suggest. F
defaultirst
default, we must read Art
default 4 Charter in conjunction with
default Article 51, so that 
defaultArt
default 4 offers protection 
defaultonly if EU or 
defaultnational
default 
defaultauthorities torture people 'when implementing Union law'.
default However, even in the event that the national aut
defaulth
defaultorit
defaulti
defaultes do fall within the scope of Art 51, 
defaultit is not the case that 
default‘everyone’ 
defaultwill 
defaultbe
default able to benefit from this right.
default The
default 2010 UK
default 
defaultZagorski
default case adds a further twist to this situation. 
default&#xa0;
default4.1default The relevance of the 
defaultZagorski
default case 
defaultIn this
default case, the 
defaultapplicant, 
defaultZagorski
default, wa
defaults in custody 
defaultin the US 
defaultfacing execution for the killing of two men in 1983. 
defaultHe 
defaultsought judicial review of the decision by 
defaultUK 
defaultBusiness Secretary 
defaultnot to ban the export of sodium 
defaultthiopental 
default(a drug used for lethal injections) 
defaultto the United States
default.
default This case raised several 
defaultquestions 
defaultregarding 
defaultthe applicability of European human rights standards. From the outset, the Court acknowledged that the 
defaultECHR 
defaultwas not applicable as Article 1 of the Convention requires 
defaultstates to secure the rights of ‘
defaultever
defaultyone within their 
defaultjurisdiction’
default.
default A
defaults 
defaultZagorski
default was in the US and under the effective control of US authorities he could not claim protection under the European Convention.
default 
default   
defaultBut
default 
defaultZagorski
default 
defaultalso 
defaultclaimed a breach of Art
default 4 Charter
default,
default 
defaultand claimed that the Charter wa
defaults not jurisdictionally bound in the 
defaultsame 
defaultway 
defaultas the Convention
default. 
defaultHowever, i
defaultn 
defaultZagorski
default, Lloyd Jones J held that the Charter also had a restricted personal scope, in that it would only apply to persons within the jurisdiction of the UK, and not to the 
defaultapplicant
defaults, who were prisoners on death row i
defaultn Tennessee. The judge relied upon Art
default 52(3) (which requires
default Charter rights to have the same meaning as equivalent ECHR rights
default -
default holding that this
default 
defaultapplied not only to the meaning of the 
defaultrights, but also to their scope)
default as the basis for
default reading into Arts
default 2 and 4 of the Charter jurisdictional limitat
defaultions equivalent to those in Art
default 1 ECHR.
default 
default   The judge 
defaultalso noted that Art 52(3) further provides that the 
defaultEU may provide more extensive protection but 
defaulti
defaultt is not 
defaultcompletely 
defaultclear 
defaultto me 
defaulton what grounds th
defaulte judge concluded that the EU
default did not seek to provide more extensive protection in this area.
default Lloyd Jones J did suggest 
defaultthat protection without territorial limits 
defaultas 
defaultpropo
defaultsed by the applicants would be ‘radical’ because it would mean that the ‘
defaultCharter would confer such rights on anyone, anywhere in the world, regardless of whether they 
defaulthave any connection with the EU’
default. 
defaultHowever, perhaps 
defaultthe judge’s supposition here 
defaultgoes too far, because as discussed above, 
defaultthe Charter 
defaultalways 
defaultrequire
defaults
default a connection with EU law for its rights to be engaged. The UK would simply be prohibited, when acting under EU law, from engaging in action which violated the rights of any individual regardless of where they are on the globe.
default Understood this way
default, the applicant’s proposal is less radical. 
defaultHowever, the judge may have come to a 
defaultsensible 
defaultconclusion – if the EU seeks to provide further protection than the ECHR, then it is arguable that such action should be taken by EU institutions and not by the UK
default courts
default.
default  So it is clear that the requirement for some sort of personal connection lessens the potential scope of the Charter in the UK, although the Charter itself sets no territorial limits in the way that the ECHR does, and Art 52(3) may be used in future to secure a broader personal scope for it.
default&#xa0;
default5. ConclusiondefaultThe potential application of the Charter in the UK is pretty broad, following the generous interpretation given by the CJEU in 
defaultÅkerberg
default 
defaultof 
defaultArt 51 Charter
default. However, at present, despite the considerations of AG 
defaultSharpston
default in her 
defaultRuiz 
defaultZambrano
default Opinion, there does not seem to be a danger of the Charter operating as a federalizing instrument similar to the approach taken by the US Supreme Court to the US federal Bill of Rights. However, there is room for a wide interpretation of the Charter’s personal scope, notwithstanding the UK 
defaultZagorski
default authority, given that there is, unlike in the case of the ECHR, no territorial limit to its personal scope, and Art 52(3) permits a broader interpretation of the Charter, going beyond that of the ECHR comparable rights.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultC. TO WHAT EXTENT defaultIS defaultTHE CHARTER BEING APPLIED HORIZONTALLY BETWEEN PRIVATE INDIVIDUdefaultALS AND BODIESdefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default1. Horizontal effect of fundamental rightsdefaultThe notion of horizontal effect is 
defaultclearly 
defaultcontroversial when applied 
defaultto 
defaultfundamental rights. Rights are traditionally justified as 
defaultindividual 
defaultprotections against the
default 
defaultstate
default, but if applied 
defaultinstead 
defaultas obligations on citizens then they are liable to appear as intrusions into private liberty. However, against this
default,
default it may be argued that some private 
defaultentities 
defaultare just as capable as the state of wielding power in a way affecting the rights of citizens
default,
default and so horizontal effect of fundamental rights provides protection against this. 
default    Notwithstanding this, the majority of EU member states do not recognise direct horizontal effect of fundamental rights under national constitutional law. Further, given that 
defaultArticle
default 51
default(1) limits the legal effect of Charter rights to EU
default institutions and bodies, and to Member States only when implementing Union law, this 
defaultraises the issue of 
defaultwhether 
defaultrecognising horizontal direct effect of 
defaultCharter rights 
defaultundermines the intent 
defaultof the 
defaultdrafters of the Charter. 
default   I now consider t
defaulthese issues in the light of relevant 
defaultcaselaw
default.
default&#xa0;
default2. defaultKucukdevecidefault defaultThe 
defaultCJEU 
defaultKucukdeveci
default judgment of 
default2010
default 
defaultis a very important authority, and 
defaultsuggests that 
defaultboth general principles of EU law and
default provisions of the Charter are capable of affecting legal relations between private parties. 
default   
defaultFor clarity’s sake, the facts are worth summarising. 
defaultMs 
defaultKücükdeveci
default had been employed in Germany by 
defaultSwedex
default for ten years, when, age
defaultd
default 28, she was dismissed by that company, with one month’s notice. In accordance with German legislation, in calculating her notice period, no account was taken of any employment prior to age 25. She challenged her dismissal, claiming that German law discriminated on grounds of age and itself violated EU law, and, in particular, Directive 78/2000, whose implementation period had expired prior to her dismissal. However, given that 
defaultSwedex
default was a private party, the general prohibition on horizontal direct effect of directives would normally have prevented her reliance on the Directive. In spite of this, the CJEU 
defaultheld 
defaultthat non-discrimination on grounds of age was a general principle of EU law which was given specific expression in the Directive.  Indeed, in 
defaultMangold
default in 
default2005, the Court had already recognized the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of age as a new general principle of EU law.
default Article 21(1) of the Charter also provides that 
default‘ .
default . . discrimination based on ... age ... shall be prohibited’. The Court in 
defaultKücükdeveci
default concluded that the principle, as given expression by the Directive, precluded the German national legislation.
default 
default  
defaultKücükdeveci
default illustrates that general principles of EU law (and their realization as EU fundamental rights) can have horizontal direct effect. This development is very important, given that general principles and fundamental rights usually protect individuals from public 
defaultauthorities
default not private parties. Given the significance of such a holding, it might have been thought desirable that the CJEU set out the reasons for the extending the reach of general principles of law into the private sphere. However, 
defaultKücükdeveci
default provides no such clear reasoning. In 
defaultMangold
default 
defaultand 
defaultKücükdeveci
default 
defaultthe Court looked to member state constitutional traditions and international law as a 
defaultsource for the principle of non-
defaultdiscrimination on grounds 
defaultof age. Yet the horizontal application of the equality principle is not the norm at the national and international level, 
defaultand very few EU member States even explicitly recognize such a general principle.
default Nor does the Court’s citation of the Charter provide any support for horizontal application because the scope of the Charter is, as already discussed, in Art 51 CFR, limited to EU bodies and member States.
default&#xa0;
default2.1default   The holding in 
defaultKücükdeveci
default 
defaultprovokes speculation as to which other general principles the Court might consider to have horizontal effect.
default 
defaultIn 
defaultthe 
default2009 
defaultAudiolux
default case, the CJEU held that a principle must have a ‘constitutional status,’ to qualify as a general principle of 
defaultEU law. 
defaultO
defaultbvious candidates for principles of constitutional status are those set out in the Charter, although the field is not limited to the Charter. Therefore, although according to Art 51 CFR, the Charter may not extend EU competences, it may nonetheless be utilized to enable the faster transposition of EU law into domestic law, 
defaultand bind
default private parties.
default&#xa0;
default3. default defaultConfirmation by Advocate General of CJEU that wording of Art 51(1) Charter does not rule of out horizontal effect – defaultAMSdefault casedefaultA recent case that tackles the horizontal effect of the Charter head on is 
defaultAssociation de 
defaultMédiation
default 
defaultSociale
default&#xa0;
default [
default2013]
default. 
default 
defaultIn this case, 
defaultAG 
defaultCruz 
defaultVillalon
default 
defaulthad to determine 
defaultwhether 
defaultArticle 27 
defaultCharter, which sets out 
defaultthe workers’ right to information and consultation within the undertaking
default,
default and 
defaultis 
defaultimplemented through 
defaultDirective 2002/14
default,
default 
defaultcould 
defaultbe applied in a legal dispute between two private parties
default. In so doing, 
defaultthe Advocate Gen
defaulteral emphasized that Article 51
default(1) Charter 
defaultdoes not exclude
default effects on private parties by not mentioning them (
defaultpara
default 29)
default (italics added)
default. 
defaultAfter 
defaultdiscussing some 
defaultdifferent 
defaultinterpretations 
defaultof horizontal effect, the Advocate General found that the potential for horizontal effect differed from right to right (
defaultpara
default 38). 
defaultGiven that 
defaultArticle 27 itself refers in its title to the right having to be granted ‘within the undertaking’ (
defaultparas
default 39-40) 
defaultthis would seem to imply some at least 
defaultlegal obligations for companies (
defaultpara
default 40)
default.
default 
defaultThe Advocate General 
defaulttherefore concluded
default 
defaultthat Art
default 27 can be relied upon in principle in legal proc
defaulteedings between private parties
default.
default&#xa0;
default4. What is meant by horizontal effect of fundamental rights?defaultBut how are we to understand the effect of a 
defaultfundamental right 
defaultbeing applied horizontally, agai
defaultnst a private party? Is this an
default example of a directly enforceable right? And if so, does it open the door to the
default direct enforcement
default of socio-economic rights against (both state and) private parties – for example, the right to fair and just working conditions in Art 31 Charter. This is where the position becomes very complicated. 
default   Notably
default, many 
defaultcommentators
default use the term ‘
defaulthorizontal direct effect
default’
default of the Charter to 
defaultcapture 
defaultany 
defaultoccasion o
defaultn which a Charter norm is invoked in litigation between two private parties. 
defaultHowever, when considering these examples, 
defaultfurther
default situations in fact need to be 
defaultdistinguished
default, such as the following
default considered below.
default&#xa0;
default4.1default 
defaultStrict direct horizontal effect between private parties
defaultDirect horizontal effect 
defaultin the strict sense 
defaultis at issue where the litigation concerns only the private law relations between two 
defaultprivate parties, 
defaultand there is no act of the State whose fundamental rights-conformity could be at issue. 
defaultFor example, in the case of an employment 
defaultlaw dispute
default,
default 
defaultan employee 
defaultmight attempt to invoke
default Artic
defaultle 31 Charter directly,
default 
defaultarguing that it 
defaultrequired
default 
defaulthis employer to 
defaultprovide 
defaulta particular working condition for which there is no basis in national law and no EU 
defaultspecific provision (for example a directive) 
defaultrequiring such a condition to be
default implemented
default. Here, 
defaultit would appear that strict horizontal effect 
defaultwould conflict with Article 51(1). Article 51
default(1) would be 
defaultredundant 
defaultif 
defaultnational courts 
defaultcould directly apply Charter 
defaultrights, in such a case where there exists 
defaultno 
defaultconnection 
defaultto 
defaultany 
defaultother
default 
defaultEU 
defaultlaw being implemented
default,
default and thus,
default falling entirely within the scope of national law
default. 
defaultThis would be the sort of federalising of EU fundamental rights law discussed above. 
defaultIn such a case, 
defaultthe Charter is 
defaultsimply inapplicable.
default&#xa0;
default4.2default 
defaultHorizontal effect within the scope of EU law
defaultThe case 
defaultis 
defaultdifferent 
defaultif 
default– sticking with Art 31 
defaultCharter 
default- 
defaultthere 
defaultexists
default 
defaulta
defaultn EU 
defaultdirective requiring the working condition to be enshrined in national law
default,
default 
defaultwhich has not been complied with by the national 
defaultlegislator. 
defaultGiven the scope of the 
defaultÅkerberg
default 
defaultFransson
default ruling, it is arguable that such a situation falls within 
defaultArticle 51
default(1) because of the directive, and that the 
defaultnational
default courts must then 
defaultinterpret 
defaultnational 
defaultlaw in the light of the Charter right invoked, 
defaultif it 
defaultis unconditional and sufficientl
defaulty precise to have direct effect.
default   
defaultRelated to this are the 
defaultMangold
default, 
defaultKücükdeveci
default 
defaultand 
defaultDominguez
default 
defaultcases.
default These cases share a common factual situation
default:
default the existence of a 
defaultnational 
defaultprovision controlling 
defaultthe relationship between two private parties, whose conformity with the Charter was
default at issue
default. Therefore, they do not present an issue of direct horizontal effect
default 
defaultin its strictest sense
default, as discussed above
default. In 
defaultMangold
default 
defaultand 
defaultKücükdeveci
default, scrutiny 
defaultof the national law at issue 
defaultled the 
defaultCJEU 
defaultto find 
defaultit 
defaultin conflict with the 
defaultEU 
defaultage discrimination 
defaultprohibition
default,
default and to require 
defaultthe 
defaultsetting aside 
defaultof national law 
defaultas a consequence of the principle of 
defaultEU supremacy which had what in these circumstances EU law deems an ‘exclusionary effect
default.
default’ Nevertheless
default, in both 
defaultthese 
defaultcases, 
defaultsetting aside 
defaulta discriminatory national 
defaultprovision 
defaultacts 
defaultto the detriment of the 
defaultprivate
default 
defaultemployer, 
defaultalthough strictly speaking this is not the same as holding 
defaultthat the employer was made an addressee of a fundamental right. 
default   
defaultDominguez
default 
defaultis a further interesting case to consider here.
default  
defaultIn 
defaultDominguez
default, the 
defaultissue 
defaultwas whether the 
defaultKücükdeveci
default 
defaultapproach could 
defaultbe 
defaultapplied in 
defaultthe context of the right to paid annual leave, 
defaulton the basis that national law wa
defaults contrary to Directive 2003/88
default,
default and that this directive 
defaultsimply gave concrete effect to 
defaultArticle 31
default(2). 
defaultThe CJEU in that case did not mention Article 31
default(2), but did 
defaulthowever 
defaultrefuse to 
defaultgrant 
defaulthorizontal direct effect to the directive
default. However,
default AG 
defaultTrstenjak
default 
defaultdid consider the issue and argued 
defaultthat a
defaultn application of the 
defaultKücükdeveci
default 
defaultapproach 
defaultwould be
default inappropriate
default, as 
defaultshe found the social right in Article 31(2) to be of 
defaulta 
defaultfundamentally different character 
defaultto the equality rights, including the right not to be disc
defaultriminated against in Article 21
default(2)
default at issue in 
defaultKücükdeveci
default.
default This was because, unlike 
defaultt
defaulthe equality right in Article 21
default,
default the social right to annual paid leave 
defaultcannot function in a freestanding way, but 
defaultrequires 
defaultfurther 
defaultlegislative
default action. Directive 2003/88 could only be construed as
default one possible 
defaultimplementation 
defaultof Article 31
default(2)
default and therefore 
defaultit would be 
defaultmisplaced 
defaultto 
defaulttranspose 
defaultthe 
defaultspecific 
defaultcontent of the directive to the level of primary law 
defaultby importing it into Article 31
default(2).
default To put it differently
default, whereas the prohibition of discrimination on account of age was unconditional and sufficiently precise to produce direct effect in 
defaultMangold
default 
defaultand 
defaultKücükdeveci
default, the right to paid annual leave does not 
defaultsatisfy 
defaultthese 
defaultconditions.
default 
defaultThe CJEU 
defaultleft it to the national court and legislature to 
defaultremedy 
defaultthis
default situation
default, without granting horizontal effect to the Charter right
default.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default5. UK defaultcaselawdefault: defaultBenkharbouchedefault defaultSo much for the CJEU authorities.
default There is also recent UK 
defaultcaselaw
default on this area, namely 
defaultthe important 
defaultBenkharbouche
default defaultcase of 2013.
default I
defaultn 
defaultBenkharbouche
default, 
defaultservants employed 
defaultat the Sudanese 
defaultand Libyan 
defaultembassies in Lond
defaulton 
defaultbrought a number of claims in the Employment Tribunal, including unfair dismissal, race discrimination and breaches 
defaultof the 
defaultEU 
defaultWorking Time Directive. However, t
defaultheir claims were dismissed under the State Immunity Act 1978 (SIA).
default 
defaultThe c
defaultlai
defaultmants appealed, arguing that this
default decision breached their rights of access to a court or tribunal under Article 6 ECHR and Article 47 Charter. 
default   The E
defaultmployment 
defaultA
defaultppeal 
defaultT
defaultribunal
default held that it was bound by 
defaultEU law to 
defaultdisapply
default domestic law.
default 
defaultWhile the Human Rights Act (
defaultHRA
default)
default could not be used to 
defaultdisapply
default the provisions of the SIA, the 
defaultEU 
defaultCharter 
defaultapplies 
defaultin UK law and, following the CJEU’s decision in 
defaultKucukdeveci
default, such rights can be enforced directly against private individuals. Therefore, the EAT was bound to 
defaultdisapply
default the provisions of the SIA by reference to the Charter.
default   
defaultThe 
defaultUK 
defaultcourt (
defaultLangstaff
default P) stressed that the
default obligation to 
defaultdisapply
default the SIA was 
defaultrestricted 
defaultto issues 
defaultfalling within 
defaultthe material scope of EU law. 
defaultOn that basis, 
defaultthe 
defaultclaims relating to discrimination, harassment and breaches of the 
defaultEU 
defaultWorking Time Regulations were 
defaultviable 
defaultbut their claims for unfair dismissal and minimum wage
default were not actionable
default.
default 
default   
defaultBenkharbouche
default appears to be 
defaultthe first 
defaultcase in which 
defaultEU Charter 
defaultr
defaultights 
defaulthave been actionable 
defaultin a 
defaultUK 
defaultdispute between private parties (
defaultin the slightly strange situation in which 
defaultalthough the embassies are state institutions, as an employment dispute the matter is 
defaulttreated as 
defaultone of private law). 
default    The position may be stated bluntly: although 
defaultthe HRA 
defaultdoes not require 
defaultthe disapplication of any 
defaultstatute 
defaultby any
default UK court
default, EU law 
defaultdoes require
default it
default, even in some cases concerning private parties.
default 
default&#xa0;
default6. ConclusiondefaultBoth the CJEU and UK authorities have considerable implications for the application of the Charter between private parties. While they indicate that they the Charter may be applied in a number of different ways horizontally, not all of them corresponding to the direct enforceability of Charter rights, they do indicat
defaulte that the Charter has consider
defaultable potential to operate in the private sphere.
