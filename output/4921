Written evidence [bold]from [bold]Sionaidh[bold] Douglas-Scott[bold], [bold]Professor of European and Human Rights Law,[bold] [bold]University of Oxford[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Summary of evidence[bold]It is undeniable that both the CJEU and n
[normal]atio
[normal]nal courts
[normal] are 
[normal]now 
[normal]frequently confronted with arguments based on the EU 
[normal]Charter and 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]have no choice but to 
[normal]work with 
[normal]fundamental rights aspects of EU law. 
[normal]Although it is stated time and again that 
[normal]the Charter 
[normal]has 
[normal]created no new rights, 
[normal]nonetheless, this swiftly accumulating 
[normal]case law 
[normal]is a bold testament to 
[normal]the difference 
[normal]that 
[normal]a written
[normal] Bill of Rights can make.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This written evidence considers 3 particular issues, namely:
[normal]A. 
[normal]Does the UK/Pol
[normal]and Protocol function as an opt-
[normal]out 
[normal]from
[normal] the EU Charter?
[normal]B. 
[normal]The application of the Charter in and to the UK
[normal]C.
[normal] 
[normal]The extent to which the Charter is being applied horizontally between private individuals and bodies
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Each of these issues raises complex, technical and tricky issues of law, where there are sometimes no clear answers.
[normal] However, a very terse summary of my conclusions would be the following:
[normal]A. 
[normal]The
[normal] Protocol does not generally function as an opt-out
[normal]B. The application of the Charter is quite complicated, but recent CJEU 
[normal]caselaw
[normal] has given a very broad interpretation of when the Charter is applicable in member states
[normal]C. The Charter has been
[normal],
[normal] and will continue to be
[normal],
[normal] applied horizontally between private parties both by the European Court and the national courts, although we must take care to define what we mean by ‘operate horizontally,’ as this is not necessarily the same as giving rise to directly enforceable rights.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]A[bold]. DOES THE UK/POLAND PROTOCOL FUNCTION AS AN OPT OUT?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1. [bold]Introduction[bold]In 
[normal]R (AB) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
[normal] [2013] 
[normal]Mostyn
[normal] J stated
[normal] (
[normal]para
[normal]. 10 of the judgment) –
[normal]‘ . . . I was sure that the British government . . . had secured at the negotiations of the Lisbon Treaty an opt-out from the incorporation of the Charter into EU law and thereby via operation of the European Communities Act 1972 directly into our domestic law.’
[normal] However 
[normal]Mostyn
[normal] J continued at paragraph 14 to state that, as a result of the judgement of the European Court of Justice in 
[normal]N. S. v Secretary of State for the Home Department
[normal] [2011] ‘Notwithstanding the endeavours of our political representatives at Lisbon it would seem that the much wider Charter of Rights is now part of our domestic law.’ 
[normal]   This 
[normal]particular statement 
[normal]has 
[normal]helped to reignite
[normal] the
[normal] debate as to whether Protocol 
[normal]No
[normal] 30 on the a
[normal]pplication of the Charter of Fundamental Rights to Poland and to the 
[normal]UK 
[normal]functions to exclude the application of the EU Charter within the UK.
[normal]   
[normal]Mostyn
[normal] J’s comments were themse
[normal]lves surprising to those 
[normal]of us 
[normal]who
[normal] never believed that the UK had secured an opt-out from the operations of the Charter. 
[normal]For example, the House of Commons Select Committee on European Scrutiny
[normal],
[normal] Third Report
[normal] 2007
[normal],
[normal] stated clearly at paragraph 38:
[normal] 
[normal]‘
[normal]It is clear that the Government accepts that the Charter will be legally binding, and it has stated that the Protocol is
[normal] 
[normal]not an opt-out. Since the Protocol is to operate subject to the UK's obligations under the Treaties, it still seems doubtful
[normal] 
[normal]to us that the Protocol has the effect that the courts of this country will not be bound by interpretations of measures of
[normal] 
[normal]Union law given by the ECJ and based on the Charter.
[normal]’ 
[normal]In the 2012 case of 
[normal]Rugby Football Union v Consolidated Information Services 
[normal]the UK Supreme Court confirmed at 
[normal]paras
[normal]. 26-28 that the Charter 
[normal]takes 
[normal]effect in national law, ‘
[normal]binding member states wh
[normal]en they are implementing EU law’
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]Further, if the Protocol were to operate as an effective opt-out then this would cast doubt 
[normal]on 
[normal]the wording of various recitals of the Preamble to the Protocol which seem to assume 
[normal]the applicability of the Charter in the UK
[normal],
[normal] and give the impression that the Protocol is a clarifying exercise 
[normal]eg
[normal] (bold highlighting added)
[normal]:
[normal]‘WHEREAS the aforementioned Article 6 requires the Charter to be applied and interpreted by the courts of Poland and of the United Kingdom strictly in accordance with the explanations referred to in that Article, . . .
[normal]WHEREAS the Charter reaffirms the rights, freedoms and principles recognised in the Union and makes those rights more visible, but does not create new rights or 
[normal]principles, . . .
[normal]NOTING the wish of Poland and the United Kingdom to 
[normal]clarify [bold]certain aspects of the application of the Charter,
[normal]DESIROUS therefore of 
[normal]clarifying[bold] the application of the Charter in relation to the laws and administrative action of Poland and of the United Kingdom and of its 
[normal]justiciability
[normal] within Polan
[normal]d and within the United Kingdom . . .’
[normal]   Such an interpretation is confirmed b
[normal]y the judgment of the European C
[normal]ourt of Justice 
[normal](CJEU) 
[normal]in the 2011 
[normal]NS
[normal] case, in which the Advocate General held (at 
[normal]para
[normal] 167): ‘the question whether Protocol No 30 is to be regarded as a general opt-out from the Charter of Fundamental Rights for the United Kingdom and the Republic of Poland can be easily answered in the negative,
[normal]’ and the 
[normal]CJ
[normal]EU
[normal] held (at 
[normal]para
[normal] 119): ‘ ... Protocol (No 30) does not call into question the applicability of the Charter in the United Kingdom or in Poland, a position which is confirmed by the recitals in the preamble to that protocol.’
[normal]   
[normal]However, even if the Protocol does not operate as an opt-out overall, this does not mean that it may have no impact whatever on the application of the Charter within the UK. In particular, the wording of Art 1(2) of the Protocol may have lessened the application of Title IV (Solidarity) provisions within the UK. So i
[normal]t 
[normal]is necessary 
[normal]to consider each of the provisions of Protocol no 30 in turn. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.[bold] 
[normal]Article 1 (1)[bold] Protocol[bold]‘
[normal]The Charter does not extend the ability of the Court of Justice of the European Union, or any court or tribunal of Poland or of the United Kingdom, to find that the laws, regulations or administrative provisions, practices or action of Poland or of the United Kingdom are inconsistent with the fundamental rights, freedoms and principles that it reaffirms.
[normal]’
[normal]The crucial words 
[normal]are 
[normal]‘does not extend the ability.’ According to Art 1(1) 
[normal]Protocol, 
[normal]the Charter provides no new competences for the EU but it does not limit any existing EU competences. 
[normal]This position is also substantiated by Article 51(2) Charter which states:
[normal]‘The Charter does not extend the field of application of Union law beyond the powers of the Union or establish any new power or task for the Union, or modify powers and tasks as defined in the Treaties.’
[normal]The 
[normal]CJEU
[normal] 
[normal]has long had the power to find national laws 
[normal]that 
[normal]fall within the scope of EU law inconsistent with EU fundamental rights law. 
[normal]In the
[normal]se circumstances, Article 1(1) Protocol does not exempt the 
[normal]UK 
[normal]from the obligation to comply with the Charter or prevent a 
[normal]UK 
[normal]court from ensuring compliance with
[normal] the Charter
[normal].
[normal]A final point to be made here is that Art 1(2) Protocol, d
[normal]i
[normal]s
[normal]c
[normal]ussed 
[normal]immediately 
[normal]below, would appear to be redundant, if 
[normal]Art 1(1) had in fact succee
[normal]d
[normal]ed in creating a general opt
[normal]–out.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3[bold]. [bold]Article 1(2) [bold]Protocol[bold]:[bold]‘In particular, and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in Title IV of the Charter creates 
[normal]justiciable
[normal] rights applicable to Poland or the United Kingdom except in so far as Poland or the United Kingdom has provided for such rights in its national law.’
[normal]Title IV of the
[normal] Charter concern rights of Solidarity
[normal] and 
[normal]covers 
[normal]Arts 27-38 Charter. 
[normal]It contains
[normal],
[normal] for example
[normal],
[normal] Art 30 ‘Protection in the event of unjustified dismissal’ and Art 
[normal]28 on 
[normal]the right to collective bargaining, ‘including strike action’. These rights were of particular concern to the UK 
[normal](
[normal]there is no explicit right to strike under UK 
[normal]domestic 
[normal]law
[normal])
[normal]. 
[normal]If any part of Protocol 30 is 
[normal]capable
[normal] of functioning as an ‘opt-out’ then it is
[normal],
[normal] surely, Art 1(2). But can it function in this way?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.[bold]1[bold] 
[normal]No clear CJEU authority yet on status of Art 1(2) Protocol
[normal]To date, there is no clear authority on the status of Art 1(2) from the CJEU. In the 
[normal]NS 
[normal]case, the CJEU held that ‘Since the rights referred to in the cases in the main proceedings do not form part of Title IV of the Charter, there is no need to rule on the interpretation of Article 1(2) of Protocol (No 30).’
[normal]   However, Advocate General 
[normal]Trstenjak
[normal], in 
[normal]NS
[normal], while remarking that Title IV was not at issue in the 
[normal]NS
[normal] case, did consider what might be the implications for Art 1(2) Protocol, noting (in 
[normal]para
[normal] 173 of her Opinion) that: 
[normal]‘With the statement that Title IV of the Charter of Fundamental Rights does not create 
[normal]justiciable
[normal] rights applicable to Poland or the United Kingdom, Article 1(2) of Protocol No 30 first reaffirms the principle, set out in Article 51(1) of the Charter, that the Charter does not create 
[normal]justiciable
[normal] rights as between private individuals.
[normal]   However, Article 1(2) of Protocol No 30 also appears to rule out new EU rights and entitlements being derived from Articles 27 to 38 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, on which those entitled could rely against the United Kingdom or against Poland.’ 
[normal]   With respect, the first sentence of 
[normal]para
[normal] 173 of her 
[normal]Opinion 
[normal]is puzzling, given that Art 51(1) Charter is not limited to claims between private individuals. However, the second part of 
[normal]para
[normal] 173 seems to me to be a more accurate statement of the law, although must be regarded in English legal terms as merely ‘obiter’ given that those rights were not at issue in the 
[normal]NS 
[normal]case itself.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.[bold]2[bold] 
[normal]The distinction between rights and princi
[normal]ples
[normal]Art 1(2) should be read in line with Art 52(5) of the Charter itself, which states:
[normal]Art 52(5) 
[normal]‘The provisions of this Charter which contain principles may be implemented by legislative and executive acts taken by institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union, and by acts of Member States when they are implementing Union law, in the exercise of their respective powers. They shall be judicially 
[normal]cognizable
[normal] only in the interpretation of such acts and in the ruling on their legality.’ 
[normal]In this way, those rights 
[normal]designated 
[normal]‘principles’ are deemed incapable of creating directly enforceable rights. 
[normal]It is often suggested that
[normal] ‘principles’ refer to economic, social and cultural rights, and Art 52(5) reflects the desire of 
[normal]at least some of 
[normal]the Charter’s drafters 
[normal]to ensure that socio-economic rights would not be directly in enforceable in courts. 
[normal]   
[normal]Many commentators on
[normal] the Protocol have suggested that Art 1(2) merely confirms the distinction between rights and principles in Art 52(5). The problem, however, is that Article 52(5) does not clearly distinguish which provisions are to be interpreted as ‘ri
[normal]ghts’ and which as ‘principles’
[normal], although in fact only three provisions in the Charter explicitly use the word ‘principle’ – Art 23 (principle of equality between men and women); Art 37 (sustainable development) and Art 47 (proportionality and legality of criminal offences). The 
[normal]Official 
[normal]Explanations 
[normal]to the Charter 
[normal]are not of great help, especially as they note that some Articles may contain both rights and principles – 
[normal]eg
[normal] Arts 23, 33 and 34. Theref
[normal]o
[normal]re, it 
[normal]cannot 
[normal]be said with certainty that Title IV contains only principles. So the distinction be
[normal]tw
[normal]een rights and principles does not work as an adequate explan
[normal]a
[normal]tion of Art 1(2) Protocol, although it does appear to confirm that those provisions in Title IV 
[normal]that 
[normal]are 
[normal]principles
[normal],
[normal] are not 
[normal]justiciable
[normal]. But this would be the case anyway under the Charter. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2[bold] 
[normal]Does Art 1(2) render Title IV 
[normal]rights[bold] non 
[normal]justiciable
[normal]?
[normal]However, 
[normal]an important question is whether 
[normal]Art 1(2) 
[normal]might 
[normal]reach beyond Art 52(5) Charter and succeed in establ
[normal]ishing that even provisions of Title IV which are classified
[normal] 
[normal]as 
[normal]rights
[normal] are not 
[normal]justiciable
[normal] 
[normal]unless the UK has provided for them in national law
[normal]?
[normal] For example, the 
[normal]Art 28 right of collective barga
[normal]ining and strike action 
[normal]presents itself as a right not a principle, but it could be argued that the effect of Art 1(2) Protocol is to ensure that it
[normal] i
[normal]s not 
[normal]justiciable
[normal]. 
[normal]However, Ar
[normal]t
[normal] 28 
[normal]Charter 
[normal]itself provides that workers have these rights ‘in accordance with Union law and national laws and practices’. UK law only permits strikes under limited conditions, 
[normal]and 
[normal]there is no ‘
[normal]right
[normal] to strike’ as such. So it would appear that
[normal],
[normal] even according to the provisions of the Charter itself, the right must be grounded in national law and practices
[normal], 
[normal]so Art 1(2) adds little in this case
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3[bold] 
[normal]General Principles of law operate in any case
[normal]In any case, the possibility for Art 1(2) to function as an effective opt-out for the UK from socio-economic rights is further limited by the fact that, even were 
[normal]all of 
[normal]Title IV itself to be
[normal] unenforceable in the UK
[normal], the UK would be still bound by EU fundamental rights law in these areas. This is because, according to Art 6(3) TEU, 
[normal]‘
[normal]Fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the ECHR and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, shall constitute general principles of the Union’s law
[normal]’ and the Protocol does not apply to general principles of law.
[normal]    Art
[normal] 6(3)
[normal] 
[normal]reflect
[normal]s
[normal] the earli
[normal]er 
[normal]caselaw
[normal] of the CJEU
[normal],
[normal] in which
[normal] it was held that respect for fundamental rights forms part of the general principles of law protected by the Court. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4[bold] 
[normal]But do Charter rights extend beyond general principles of law?
[normal]Art 1(2) 
[normal]Protocol 
[normal]would only be of significance if the rights in the Charter went beyond those recognised as general principles of law. But, although as 
[normal]Mostyn
[normal] J rightly pointed out in the 
[normal]AB
[normal] case, the Charter extends well beyond those ECHR rights enforced through the UK Human Rights Act, it is still the case that the Charter draws on those rights that were already recognised in EU law, as the official Explanations make clear. The Explanations set out the source
[normal]s
[normal] for all of the Charter rights. In the case of the T
[normal]i
[normal]tle IV rights, many of these are sourced from 
[normal]the Council of Europe European Social Charter and the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers. The European Social Charter is a treaty which is 
[normal]binding
[normal] on those that have ratified it 
[normal](which includes the UK). 
[normal]In contrast, the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers is not 
[normal]binding
[normal] but a political declaration only
[normal], although many of its obligations have been enforced by other texts, such as EU 
[normal]directives
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]   
[normal]However, neither the European Social Charter, nor the Community Charter might be seen as binding in the sense of ‘directly effective’, 
[normal]or directly enforceable in a court of law, 
[normal]so unless a further source for the right in question could be 
[normal]found  –
[normal] for example in an EU directive, or a judgement of the
[normal] CJEU
[normal], then an attempt to render these rights directly effective in national law, could be seen as going further than existing practice and introducing new rights in the UK.
[normal] An example here might be the right to a placement service in Art 29 Charter, which is expressed as a right, not a principle, 
[normal]and 
[normal]has a prior source in the European Social Charter and the Community Charter
[normal]. In such as case, Art 1(2) Protocol might operate in what has been described as a ‘belt and braces’ fashion, to ensure that Art 29 cannot be directly effective in the UK.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.[bold] 
[normal]Art 2 Protocol[bold] 
[normal]‘To the extent that a provision of the Charter refers to national laws and practices, it shall only apply to Poland or the United Kingdom to the extent that the rights or principles that it contains are recognised in the law or practices of Poland or of the United Kingdom.’
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This provision does not appear to offer very much new. It seems merely to underline Art 52(6) 
[normal]Charter 
[normal]which states: 
[normal]‘Full account shall be taken of national laws and practices as specified in this Charter’.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. Conclusion[bold]The Protocol, with the possible exception of Art 1(2), and that to a limited extent only, does not function as an opt-out.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]B. THE APPLICATION OF THE CHARTER IN AND TO THE UK[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.[bold] 
[normal]Given that Protocol 30 does not function as an opt-out for the UK (except 
[normal]perhaps 
[normal]to a limited extent for Art 1(2) Protocol) it will be crucial to know 
[normal]exactly 
[normal]when the Charter applies in the UK.
[normal]   
[normal]The Charter is not an instrument of limitless general review – Article 51(1) of the Charter specifies that it is ‘addressed to the institutions… of the Union… and to the 
[normal]Member States only when they are implementing Union law’
[normal] (italics added).
[normal] This, in turn, begs the question of what exactly is covered by member states in the act of implementing EU law.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.[bold] 
[normal]The meaning of[bold] ‘implementing Union law’[bold]The term ‘implementing’ might seem to imply some sort of delimitation of the Charter, rendering it applicable only in situations where
[normal],
[normal] for example, 
[normal]the UK 
[normal]is implementing an EU directive. 
[normal]Indeed the use of ‘implementing’ in Article 51(1) may suggest the intention of its drafters to reduce the 
[normal]CJEU’s 
[normal]scope of review of national measures on fundamental rights grounds, from the 
[normal]expansive
[normal] reading given by the Court in its pre-Lisbon case law. 
[normal]Indeed, t
[normal]he Convention 
[normal]drafting the Charter actually 
[normal]rejected a
[normal]n earlier
[normal] 
[normal]Praesidium
[normal] drafting proposal 
[normal]designed to bind Member States ‘
[normal]when acting within the scope of Union law
[normal]’
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]    
[normal]However, this situation is further complicated by the Charter’s
[normal] Official Explanations
[normal], whi
[normal]ch indicate
[normal] that the Charter is ‘binding on Member States when they act 
[normal]in the scope
[normal] of Union law’
[normal] and cite previous 
[normal]caselaw
[normal] of the CJEU to that effect. 
[normal]   
[normal]This phraseology is certainly broader tha
[normal]n that of ‘implementing’ EU law.
[normal] In 
[normal]R (
[normal]Zagorski
[normal]) v Secretary of State for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills 
[normal][2010] 
[normal]paras
[normal] 66-71, the English High Court held that a member State derogating from EU law was acting within the scope of EU law for the purposes of the Charter. In 
[normal]N.S.
[normal], 
[normal]the CJEU 
[normal]held that, in deciding an asylum application on whether an applicant should be returned to Greece under EU Regulation 343/2003, the EU was implementing EU law, and fell within the scope of the Charter. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1[bold] The CJEU 
[normal]Åkerberg
[normal] 
[normal]Fransson
[normal] 
[normal]ruling of 2013
[normal]While there were some attempts for a narrower understanding of the phrase ‘implementing Union law’ (
[normal]for example 
[normal]AG Cruz 
[normal]Villalón
[normal] in 
[normal]Fransson
[normal], 
[normal]see further below) 
[normal]the 
[normal]CJ
[normal]EU
[normal] itself in 
[normal]the highly important 2013 
[normal]Åkerberg
[normal] 
[normal]Fransson
[normal] 
[normal]case 
[normal]preferred a wider reading of the
[normal] phrase
[normal], holding at 
[normal]para
[normal] 21 that ‘
[normal]the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter must therefore be complied with where national legislation falls within the scope of European Union law
[normal]’.
[normal]   
[normal]The breadth 
[normal]and implications 
[normal]of this ruling can be seen more clearly if we look more closely at the facts of 
[normal]Åkerberg
[normal] 
[normal]Fransson
[normal] 
[normal]itself, which concerned tax law
[normal]. 
[normal]   
[normal]In 
[normal]Åkerberg
[normal] 
[normal]Fransson
[normal], the Swedish referring court asked the CJEU whether the principle of double jeopardy, in Art 50 Charter, was relevant to the case at hand and could be used to set aside domestic law. 
[normal]Fransson
[normal] had 
[normal]provided false information to the revenue authorities, 
[normal]and had already 
[normal]incur
[normal]red
[normal] an administrative penalty, but could additionally face criminal prosecution for the same misconduct. The Swedish court was uncertain whether the Charter applied, as it was unclear whether the Swedish dual system of tax penalties fell within the ‘implementation of Union law,’ as required by Art. 
[normal]51(1) Charter.
[normal] However, EU law 
[normal]was 
[normal]at least 
[normal]of 
[normal]some relevance 
[normal]in
[normal] 
[normal]that Directive 2006/112
[normal] entitles States to ‘impose other obligations 
[normal]which they deem necessary to ensure the correct collection of VAT and to prevent evasion.’ 
[normal]Was this sufficient to bring the Swedish tax law within the scope of the Charter?
[normal]    
[normal]Advocate General Cruz 
[normal]Villalón
[normal] 
[normal]thought not. He had suggested that the 
[normal]controlling
[normal] consideration
[normal] 
[normal]should be whether the EU had 
[normal]a ‘specific interest’ 
[normal]in centralizing
[normal] human 
[normal]rights review of 
[normal]the 
[normal]measures. 
[normal]He argued that 
[normal]argued that ‘[t]he mere fact that such an exercise of public authority has its ultimate origin in Union law is not of itself sufficient for a finding that there is a situation involving the implementation of Union law’ 
[normal]and he 
[normal]considered 
[normal]the link between the EU legislation and the Swedish measures too tenuous. 
[normal]   
[normal]The CJEU
[normal] decided the issue differently
[normal]. It ignored the AG’s 
[normal]argument requiring a specific 
[normal]EU
[normal] interest, and
[normal] instead re
[normal]peated
[normal] its former 
[normal]caselaw
[normal], 
[normal]requiring 
[normal]domestic acts 
[normal]to 
[normal]comply with EU law when they fall within the scope 
[normal]of EU law
[normal]. 
[normal]It highlighted that 
[normal]provisions of EU law require member states to 
[normal]collect VAT and
[normal] prevent VAT evasion
[normal],
[normal] and noted that any shortcoming in the domestic collecti
[normal]on of VAT affects the EU budget, and so, even if 
[normal]the Swedish legislation was not designed to transpose Directive 2006/112, its application penalise
[normal]d
[normal] the
[normal] infringement of that directive
[normal] and, 
[normal]a
[normal]s a result, the Charter applied.

[normal]2.2[bold] 
[normal]The Response
[normal] to the CJEU ruling in 
[normal]Åkerberg
[normal] 
[normal]Fransson
[normal]   
[normal]Perhaps understandably, 
[normal]Åkerberg
[normal] 
[normal]Fransson
[normal] 
[normal]has
[normal] not been universally welcomed
[normal], given that it allows a broad interpretation of the CJEU’s competences, thus enabling EU fundamental rights to apply in a potentially wide range of cases that appear to go beyond the literal wording of Art 51. Interestingly, 
[normal]Åkerberg
[normal] 
[normal]Fransson
[normal] 
[normal]has also been subject to criticism by the German 
[normal]Constitutional Court. 
[normal]In a

[normal]BvR
[normal] 1215/07) concerning a counter-terrorism database, the 
[normal]German Court 
[normal]insisted that the case 
[normal]before it 
[normal]was clearly outside the scope of the Ch
[normal]arter, as it pursued national 
[normal]objectives with only a possible ‘indirect’ effect on the functioning of legal relationships under EU law. Such a statement would 
[normal]surely 
[normal]be superfluous if the German Court were not wary of the possibility of a wide reading of the scope of the Charter by the CJEU. The 
[normal]German Court 
[normal]continued:
[normal]‘
[normal]The Senate acts on the assumption that the statements in the ECJ’s 
[normal](
[normal]Åkerberg
[normal]) 
[normal]decision are based on the distinctive features of the law on
[normal] VAT
[normal], and express no general view.’
[normal] 
[normal](Press release no. 31/2013 of 24 April 2013, 
[normal]1 
[normal]BvR
[normal] 1215/07
[normal])
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]This looks like quite a clear warning to the CJEU
[normal], and an attempt to confine the implications of 
[normal]Åkerberg
[normal] to tax law – an approach not adopted however 
[normal]b
[normal]y the CJEU itself
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3[bold] 
[normal]The breadth of the CJEU understanding of ‘the scope of EU law’
[normal]Indeed, the wide reading of the scope of the Charter in 
[normal]Åkerberg
[normal] does not signify a new approach for the CJEU. It has been interpreting the scope of EU law in fundamental rights matters widely for a number of years. As well as the cases cited in the
[normal] Official E
[normal]xplanations, and by the CJEU in the 
[normal]Åkerberg
[normal] case, an earlier case on fundamental rights nicely illustrates this. In the 
[normal]Mary Carpenter
[normal] 
[normal][2002] 
[normal]case, which predates
[normal] the 
[normal]binding
[normal] Charter, Mrs Carpenter, a 
[normal]Filippino
[normal] national, challenged her proposed 
[normal]deportation
[normal] from the UK 
[normal](
[normal]the 
[normal]official 
[normal]grounds 
[normal]for her deportation were
[normal] certain violations of immigration law on her part
[normal])
[normal]. 
[normal]This looked to be a purely domestic case, turning on national immigration law. However, 
[normal]Carpenter
[normal] argued that she derived EU law rights through her husband, a British national. Spouses of European nationals 
[normal]normally 
[normal]derive EU rights only when they move to another country, not in the country of origin, and so 
[normal]it might 
[normal]have 
[normal]been 
[normal]assumed 
[normal]that 
[normal]this was purely internal situation. However, the Court found in her favour. It stated that, 
[normal]first,
[normal] Mr Carpenter was engaged in 
[normal]providing services to other Member States’ nationals as a ‘significan
[normal]t proportion of his business’. Yet, t
[normal]he link between Mrs Carpenter’s situation and EU law was extremely tenuous. Neither she nor her husband had moved to another EU state. Nevertheless, EU law applied and human rights standards were invoked.

[normal]The shape of things to come?[bold] [bold]A ‘federalizing’ EU Charter of Rights?[bold]Cases such as 
[normal]Carpenter
[normal] and 
[normal]Åkerberg
[normal] 
[normal]illustrate the wide potential reach of EU law. Do they set the outer limit for the scope of EU law
[normal],
[normal] or is there room for even wider interpretations? Here it is 
[normal]worth 
[normal]consider
[normal]ing
[normal] the recent 2011 
[normal]Ruiz 
[normal]Zambrano
[normal] 
[normal]case
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]in which p
[normal]erhaps one of the most far reaching suggestions regarding the 
[normal]potential 
[normal]scope of EU 
[normal]fundamental rights 
[normal]law was made by AG 
[normal]Sharpston
[normal].
[normal] The main issue for determination by the 
[normal]CJEU 
[normal]was whether Mr Ruiz 
[normal]Zambrano
[normal], a Colombian national, could claim a right of residence in Belgium under EU law following the birth of his children (who were EU citizens) in 2003 and 2005, notwithstanding that his EU citizen children had yet to exercise their right of free movement within the Union, which would normally be a requirement for trigg
[normal]ering the application of EU law
[normal].
[normal]   Although most of the discussion in this case turned on EU citizenship, AG 
[normal]Sharpston
[normal], in her Opinion, considered the role of fundamental rights in EU law, arguing that their 
[normal]invocability
[normal] should be ‘dependent neither on whether a Treaty provision was directly applicable nor on whether secondary legislation had been enacted.’ Rather, AG 
[normal]Sharpston
[normal] argued that EU fundamental rights should protect the European citizen in all areas of EU competence, regardless of whether such competence had actually been exercised. Part of the point of her comparison was to compare the present EU law on fundamental rights, with its uncertain scope of EU competence, against 
[normal]an ideal of consistent protection of fundamental rights
[normal] (italics added)
[normal].  
[normal](
[normal]In particular, the question of reverse discrimination, whereby member states can, in purely internal situations, apply less favourable laws than would EU law in similar situations, continues to cause problems.
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]AG 
[normal]Sharpston
[normal] did, however, acknowledge that, this was likely to be too bold a step for the Court to take unilaterally at present, but she nonetheless suggested that the Court should consider that the evolution of EU fundamental rights law in the context of the now binding nature of the Charter, and proposed EU accession to the ECHR, might require a more robust scrutiny of fundamental rights. The Court in 
[normal]Ruiz 
[normal]Zambrano
[normal],
[normal] however, did not discuss th
[normal]is point
[normal]. 
[normal]   Interestingly, AG 
[normal]S
[normal]harpston
[normal] also stated that:
[normal] ‘[m]
[normal]aking
[normal] the application of EU fundamental rights dependent solely on the existence of exclusive or shared EU competence would involve introducing an overtly federal element into the structure of the EU’s legal and political system. Simply put, a change of the kind would be analogous to that experienced in US constitutional law after the decision in 
[normal]Gitlow
[normal] v New York
[normal] . . . A change of that kind would alter, in legal and political terms, the very nature of fundamental rights under EU law. It therefore requires both an evolution in the case-law and an unequivocal political statement from the constituent powers of the EU (its Member States), pointing at a new role for fundamental rights in the EU.’ 
[normal](
[normal]paras
[normal] 172–73
[normal])
[normal].
[normal]      AG 
[normal]Sharpston’s
[normal] reference to US jurisprudence 
[normal]may 
[normal]explain why most national governments were keen to have Art 51(1) inserted in
[normal] the Charter in the first place, namely to avoid a ‘federalizing’ movement in the field of fundamental rights, comparable to that exercised by 
[normal]the US Supreme Court 
[normal]which, in the earlier 20
[normal]th
[normal] century, incorporated
[normal] the 
[normal]US 
[normal]federal Bill of Rights 
[normal]and applied them to the states 
[normal]through 
[normal]a very wide 
[normal]interpretation of the 
[normal]14
[normal]th
[normal] 
[normal]Amendment 
[normal]of 
[normal]the US Constitution. 
[normal]For example, 
[normal]in the 1925 case of 
[normal]Gitlow
[normal] v New York
[normal], 
[normal]mentioned by AG 
[normal]Sharpston
[normal] in her Opinion, 
[normal]the US Supreme Court 
[normal]held that the 
[normal]First
[normal] 
[normal]Amendment
[normal] of the US Federal Bill of Rights may also apply to the States 
[normal]th
[normal]rough the 
[normal]operation of the 14
[normal]th
[normal] 
[normal]Amendment (which specifically applies to the states). Since then, the US Supreme Court has applied the federal bill of rights (and its expansive interp
[normal]r
[normal]etations of those rights) to 
[normal]State 
[normal]laws 
[normal]even when the States 
[normal]are 
[normal]act
[normal]ing
[normal] within their own sphere of competence.
[normal] 
[normal]In this way
[normal], the US Supreme Court has 
[normal]created 
[normal]a unified constitutional order 
[normal]of 
[normal]fundamental rights.
[normal] 
[normal]   It seems clear however, that, at present at least, 
[normal]the Charter 
[normal]does not permit 
[normal]the 
[normal]CJEU 
[normal]to 
[normal]emulate 
[normal]the US Supreme Court, 
[normal]and identify 
[normal]a ‘federal’ 
[normal]or EU 
[normal]standard 
[normal]of fundamental rights 
[normal]against which all national 
[normal]laws 
[normal]may be 
[normal]assessed 
[normal]and 
[normal]even 
[normal]set aside
[normal] or invalidated
[normal]. 
[normal]    Therefore, h
[normal]owever 
[normal]wide
[normal] the scope of EU law, there will 
[normal]continue to 
[normal]be domestic situations in which it cannot be applied. For example, the Supreme Court in 
[normal]R (on the application of Chester) v Secretary of State of for Justice; 
[normal]McGeoch
[normal] (AP) v The Lord
[normal] 
[normal]President of the Council and another
[normal] [2013] UKSC 63 unanimously dismissed two prisoners’ claims that the UK government’s refusal to allow them to vote whilst in prison breached their EU rights
[normal], on the basis that the case did not fall within the scope of EU law
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4[bold]. [bold]Who is p[bold]rotected by the EU Charter?[bold] The[bold] [bold]Personal[bold] scope of application of the Charter[bold]In addition to the material scope of EU law – namely, the EU must be acting within the scope of EU law according to 
[normal]Åkerberg
[normal] and Art 51 Charter, the applicant must also be able to show that they, personally, are protected by the Charter – or at least this seems to be the import of the UK 
[normal]Zagorski
[normal] case, discussed below. This point may not be automatically obvious, so it deserves a little further exploration. 
[normal]   
[normal]Art 51 Charter states on whom the Charter imposes obligations, but it does not state who 
[normal]may benefit
[normal] from the Charter’s rights. Instead, the EU Charter appears to deal with this
[normal] question on a case-by-case basis. Each provision 
[normal]states 
[normal]who is protected in relation
[normal] 
[normal]to the right
[normal] at issue, and this differs from right to right
[normal]. Sometimes protection is given 
[normal]only to EU 
[normal]citizens.
[normal] However
[normal], 
[normal]some 
[normal]rights
[normal] 
[normal]and freedoms are 
[normal]designed 
[normal]to be universal and to protect 'everyone', 
[normal]most 
[normal]particular
[normal]ly
[normal] the rights
[normal] located in 
[normal]the first two Chapters (Dignity, Freedoms).
[normal] 
[normal]   
[normal]So, for example, 
[normal]Article 4 Charter prohibits all forms of torture and inhuman or degrading
[normal] 
[normal]treatment or punishment. 
[normal]This appears to apply universally. 
[normal]But it is not as universal as first impressions suggest. F
[normal]irst
[normal], we must read Art
[normal] 4 Charter in conjunction with
[normal] Article 51, so that 
[normal]Art
[normal] 4 offers protection 
[normal]only if EU or 
[normal]national
[normal] 
[normal]authorities torture people 'when implementing Union law'.
[normal] However, even in the event that the national aut
[normal]h
[normal]orit
[normal]i
[normal]es do fall within the scope of Art 51, 
[normal]it is not the case that 
[normal]‘everyone’ 
[normal]will 
[normal]be
[normal] able to benefit from this right.
[normal] The
[normal] 2010 UK
[normal] 
[normal]Zagorski
[normal] case adds a further twist to this situation. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1[bold] The relevance of the 
[normal]Zagorski
[normal] case 
[normal]In this
[normal] case, the 
[normal]applicant, 
[normal]Zagorski
[normal], wa
[normal]s in custody 
[normal]in the US 
[normal]facing execution for the killing of two men in 1983. 
[normal]He 
[normal]sought judicial review of the decision by 
[normal]UK 
[normal]Business Secretary 
[normal]not to ban the export of sodium 
[normal]thiopental 
[normal](a drug used for lethal injections) 
[normal]to the United States
[normal].
[normal] This case raised several 
[normal]questions 
[normal]regarding 
[normal]the applicability of European human rights standards. From the outset, the Court acknowledged that the 
[normal]ECHR 
[normal]was not applicable as Article 1 of the Convention requires 
[normal]states to secure the rights of ‘
[normal]ever
[normal]yone within their 
[normal]jurisdiction’
[normal].
[normal] A
[normal]s 
[normal]Zagorski
[normal] was in the US and under the effective control of US authorities he could not claim protection under the European Convention.
[normal] 
[normal]   
[normal]But
[normal] 
[normal]Zagorski
[normal] 
[normal]also 
[normal]claimed a breach of Art
[normal] 4 Charter
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]and claimed that the Charter wa
[normal]s not jurisdictionally bound in the 
[normal]same 
[normal]way 
[normal]as the Convention
[normal]. 
[normal]However, i
[normal]n 
[normal]Zagorski
[normal], Lloyd Jones J held that the Charter also had a restricted personal scope, in that it would only apply to persons within the jurisdiction of the UK, and not to the 
[normal]applicant
[normal]s, who were prisoners on death row i
[normal]n Tennessee. The judge relied upon Art
[normal] 52(3) (which requires
[normal] Charter rights to have the same meaning as equivalent ECHR rights
[normal] -
[normal] holding that this
[normal] 
[normal]applied not only to the meaning of the 
[normal]rights, but also to their scope)
[normal] as the basis for
[normal] reading into Arts
[normal] 2 and 4 of the Charter jurisdictional limitat
[normal]ions equivalent to those in Art
[normal] 1 ECHR.
[normal] 
[normal]   The judge 
[normal]also noted that Art 52(3) further provides that the 
[normal]EU may provide more extensive protection but 
[normal]i
[normal]t is not 
[normal]completely 
[normal]clear 
[normal]to me 
[normal]on what grounds th
[normal]e judge concluded that the EU
[normal] did not seek to provide more extensive protection in this area.
[normal] Lloyd Jones J did suggest 
[normal]that protection without territorial limits 
[normal]as 
[normal]propo
[normal]sed by the applicants would be ‘radical’ because it would mean that the ‘
[normal]Charter would confer such rights on anyone, anywhere in the world, regardless of whether they 
[normal]have any connection with the EU’
[normal]. 
[normal]However, perhaps 
[normal]the judge’s supposition here 
[normal]goes too far, because as discussed above, 
[normal]the Charter 
[normal]always 
[normal]require
[normal]s
[normal] a connection with EU law for its rights to be engaged. The UK would simply be prohibited, when acting under EU law, from engaging in action which violated the rights of any individual regardless of where they are on the globe.
[normal] Understood this way
[normal], the applicant’s proposal is less radical. 
[normal]However, the judge may have come to a 
[normal]sensible 
[normal]conclusion – if the EU seeks to provide further protection than the ECHR, then it is arguable that such action should be taken by EU institutions and not by the UK
[normal] courts
[normal].
[normal]  So it is clear that the requirement for some sort of personal connection lessens the potential scope of the Charter in the UK, although the Charter itself sets no territorial limits in the way that the ECHR does, and Art 52(3) may be used in future to secure a broader personal scope for it.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. Conclusion[bold]The potential application of the Charter in the UK is pretty broad, following the generous interpretation given by the CJEU in 
[normal]Åkerberg
[normal] 
[normal]of 
[normal]Art 51 Charter
[normal]. However, at present, despite the considerations of AG 
[normal]Sharpston
[normal] in her 
[normal]Ruiz 
[normal]Zambrano
[normal] Opinion, there does not seem to be a danger of the Charter operating as a federalizing instrument similar to the approach taken by the US Supreme Court to the US federal Bill of Rights. However, there is room for a wide interpretation of the Charter’s personal scope, notwithstanding the UK 
[normal]Zagorski
[normal] authority, given that there is, unlike in the case of the ECHR, no territorial limit to its personal scope, and Art 52(3) permits a broader interpretation of the Charter, going beyond that of the ECHR comparable rights.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]C. TO WHAT EXTENT [bold]IS [bold]THE CHARTER BEING APPLIED HORIZONTALLY BETWEEN PRIVATE INDIVIDU[bold]ALS AND BODIES[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1. Horizontal effect of fundamental rights[bold]The notion of horizontal effect is 
[normal]clearly 
[normal]controversial when applied 
[normal]to 
[normal]fundamental rights. Rights are traditionally justified as 
[normal]individual 
[normal]protections against the
[normal] 
[normal]state
[normal], but if applied 
[normal]instead 
[normal]as obligations on citizens then they are liable to appear as intrusions into private liberty. However, against this
[normal],
[normal] it may be argued that some private 
[normal]entities 
[normal]are just as capable as the state of wielding power in a way affecting the rights of citizens
[normal],
[normal] and so horizontal effect of fundamental rights provides protection against this. 
[normal]    Notwithstanding this, the majority of EU member states do not recognise direct horizontal effect of fundamental rights under national constitutional law. Further, given that 
[normal]Article
[normal] 51
[normal](1) limits the legal effect of Charter rights to EU
[normal] institutions and bodies, and to Member States only when implementing Union law, this 
[normal]raises the issue of 
[normal]whether 
[normal]recognising horizontal direct effect of 
[normal]Charter rights 
[normal]undermines the intent 
[normal]of the 
[normal]drafters of the Charter. 
[normal]   I now consider t
[normal]hese issues in the light of relevant 
[normal]caselaw
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. [bold]Kucukdeveci[bold] [bold]The 
[normal]CJEU 
[normal]Kucukdeveci
[normal] judgment of 
[normal]2010
[normal] 
[normal]is a very important authority, and 
[normal]suggests that 
[normal]both general principles of EU law and
[normal] provisions of the Charter are capable of affecting legal relations between private parties. 
[normal]   
[normal]For clarity’s sake, the facts are worth summarising. 
[normal]Ms 
[normal]Kücükdeveci
[normal] had been employed in Germany by 
[normal]Swedex
[normal] for ten years, when, age
[normal]d
[normal] 28, she was dismissed by that company, with one month’s notice. In accordance with German legislation, in calculating her notice period, no account was taken of any employment prior to age 25. She challenged her dismissal, claiming that German law discriminated on grounds of age and itself violated EU law, and, in particular, Directive 78/2000, whose implementation period had expired prior to her dismissal. However, given that 
[normal]Swedex
[normal] was a private party, the general prohibition on horizontal direct effect of directives would normally have prevented her reliance on the Directive. In spite of this, the CJEU 
[normal]held 
[normal]that non-discrimination on grounds of age was a general principle of EU law which was given specific expression in the Directive.  Indeed, in 
[normal]Mangold
[normal] in 
[normal]2005, the Court had already recognized the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of age as a new general principle of EU law.
[normal] Article 21(1) of the Charter also provides that 
[normal]‘ .
[normal] . . discrimination based on ... age ... shall be prohibited’. The Court in 
[normal]Kücükdeveci
[normal] concluded that the principle, as given expression by the Directive, precluded the German national legislation.
[normal] 
[normal]  
[normal]Kücükdeveci
[normal] illustrates that general principles of EU law (and their realization as EU fundamental rights) can have horizontal direct effect. This development is very important, given that general principles and fundamental rights usually protect individuals from public 
[normal]authorities
[normal] not private parties. Given the significance of such a holding, it might have been thought desirable that the CJEU set out the reasons for the extending the reach of general principles of law into the private sphere. However, 
[normal]Kücükdeveci
[normal] provides no such clear reasoning. In 
[normal]Mangold
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]Kücükdeveci
[normal] 
[normal]the Court looked to member state constitutional traditions and international law as a 
[normal]source for the principle of non-
[normal]discrimination on grounds 
[normal]of age. Yet the horizontal application of the equality principle is not the norm at the national and international level, 
[normal]and very few EU member States even explicitly recognize such a general principle.
[normal] Nor does the Court’s citation of the Charter provide any support for horizontal application because the scope of the Charter is, as already discussed, in Art 51 CFR, limited to EU bodies and member States.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1[bold]   The holding in 
[normal]Kücükdeveci
[normal] 
[normal]provokes speculation as to which other general principles the Court might consider to have horizontal effect.
[normal] 
[normal]In 
[normal]the 
[normal]2009 
[normal]Audiolux
[normal] case, the CJEU held that a principle must have a ‘constitutional status,’ to qualify as a general principle of 
[normal]EU law. 
[normal]O
[normal]bvious candidates for principles of constitutional status are those set out in the Charter, although the field is not limited to the Charter. Therefore, although according to Art 51 CFR, the Charter may not extend EU competences, it may nonetheless be utilized to enable the faster transposition of EU law into domestic law, 
[normal]and bind
[normal] private parties.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. [bold] [bold]Confirmation by Advocate General of CJEU that wording of Art 51(1) Charter does not rule of out horizontal effect – [bold]AMS[bold] case[bold]A recent case that tackles the horizontal effect of the Charter head on is 
[normal]Association de 
[normal]Médiation
[normal] 
[normal]Sociale
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] [
[normal]2013]
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]In this case, 
[normal]AG 
[normal]Cruz 
[normal]Villalon
[normal] 
[normal]had to determine 
[normal]whether 
[normal]Article 27 
[normal]Charter, which sets out 
[normal]the workers’ right to information and consultation within the undertaking
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]is 
[normal]implemented through 
[normal]Directive 2002/14
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]could 
[normal]be applied in a legal dispute between two private parties
[normal]. In so doing, 
[normal]the Advocate Gen
[normal]eral emphasized that Article 51
[normal](1) Charter 
[normal]does not exclude
[normal] effects on private parties by not mentioning them (
[normal]para
[normal] 29)
[normal] (italics added)
[normal]. 
[normal]After 
[normal]discussing some 
[normal]different 
[normal]interpretations 
[normal]of horizontal effect, the Advocate General found that the potential for horizontal effect differed from right to right (
[normal]para
[normal] 38). 
[normal]Given that 
[normal]Article 27 itself refers in its title to the right having to be granted ‘within the undertaking’ (
[normal]paras
[normal] 39-40) 
[normal]this would seem to imply some at least 
[normal]legal obligations for companies (
[normal]para
[normal] 40)
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The Advocate General 
[normal]therefore concluded
[normal] 
[normal]that Art
[normal] 27 can be relied upon in principle in legal proc
[normal]eedings between private parties
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. What is meant by horizontal effect of fundamental rights?[bold]But how are we to understand the effect of a 
[normal]fundamental right 
[normal]being applied horizontally, agai
[normal]nst a private party? Is this an
[normal] example of a directly enforceable right? And if so, does it open the door to the
[normal] direct enforcement
[normal] of socio-economic rights against (both state and) private parties – for example, the right to fair and just working conditions in Art 31 Charter. This is where the position becomes very complicated. 
[normal]   Notably
[normal], many 
[normal]commentators
[normal] use the term ‘
[normal]horizontal direct effect
[normal]’
[normal] of the Charter to 
[normal]capture 
[normal]any 
[normal]occasion o
[normal]n which a Charter norm is invoked in litigation between two private parties. 
[normal]However, when considering these examples, 
[normal]further
[normal] situations in fact need to be 
[normal]distinguished
[normal], such as the following
[normal] considered below.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1[bold] 
[normal]Strict direct horizontal effect between private parties
[normal]Direct horizontal effect 
[normal]in the strict sense 
[normal]is at issue where the litigation concerns only the private law relations between two 
[normal]private parties, 
[normal]and there is no act of the State whose fundamental rights-conformity could be at issue. 
[normal]For example, in the case of an employment 
[normal]law dispute
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]an employee 
[normal]might attempt to invoke
[normal] Artic
[normal]le 31 Charter directly,
[normal] 
[normal]arguing that it 
[normal]required
[normal] 
[normal]his employer to 
[normal]provide 
[normal]a particular working condition for which there is no basis in national law and no EU 
[normal]specific provision (for example a directive) 
[normal]requiring such a condition to be
[normal] implemented
[normal]. Here, 
[normal]it would appear that strict horizontal effect 
[normal]would conflict with Article 51(1). Article 51
[normal](1) would be 
[normal]redundant 
[normal]if 
[normal]national courts 
[normal]could directly apply Charter 
[normal]rights, in such a case where there exists 
[normal]no 
[normal]connection 
[normal]to 
[normal]any 
[normal]other
[normal] 
[normal]EU 
[normal]law being implemented
[normal],
[normal] and thus,
[normal] falling entirely within the scope of national law
[normal]. 
[normal]This would be the sort of federalising of EU fundamental rights law discussed above. 
[normal]In such a case, 
[normal]the Charter is

[normal]4.2[bold] 
[normal]Horizontal effect within the scope of EU law
[normal]The case 
[normal]is 
[normal]different 
[normal]if 
[normal]– sticking with Art 31 
[normal]Charter 
[normal]- 
[normal]there 
[normal]exists
[normal] 
[normal]a
[normal]n EU 
[normal]directive requiring the working condition to be enshrined in national law
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]which has not been complied with by the national 
[normal]legislator. 
[normal]Given the scope of the 
[normal]Åkerberg
[normal] 
[normal]Fransson
[normal] ruling, it is arguable that such a situation falls within 
[normal]Article 51
[normal](1) because of the directive, and that the 
[normal]national
[normal] courts must then 
[normal]interpret 
[normal]national 
[normal]law in the light of the Charter right invoked, 
[normal]if it 
[normal]is unconditional and sufficientl
[normal]y precise to have direct effect.
[normal]   
[normal]Related to this are the 
[normal]Mangold
[normal], 
[normal]Kücükdeveci
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]Dominguez
[normal] 
[normal]cases.
[normal] These cases share a common factual situation
[normal]:
[normal] the existence of a 
[normal]national 
[normal]provision controlling 
[normal]the relationship between two private parties, whose conformity with the Charter was
[normal] at issue
[normal]. Therefore, they do not present an issue of direct horizontal effect
[normal] 
[normal]in its strictest sense
[normal], as discussed above
[normal]. In 
[normal]Mangold
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]Kücükdeveci
[normal], scrutiny 
[normal]of the national law at issue 
[normal]led the 
[normal]CJEU 
[normal]to find 
[normal]it 
[normal]in conflict with the 
[normal]EU 
[normal]age discrimination 
[normal]prohibition
[normal],
[normal] and to require 
[normal]the 
[normal]setting aside 
[normal]of national law 
[normal]as a consequence of the principle of 
[normal]EU supremacy which had what in these circumstances EU law deems an ‘exclusionary effect
[normal].
[normal]’ Nevertheless
[normal], in both 
[normal]these 
[normal]cases, 
[normal]setting aside 
[normal]a discriminatory national 
[normal]provision 
[normal]acts 
[normal]to the detriment of the 
[normal]private
[normal] 
[normal]employer, 
[normal]although strictly speaking this is not the same as holding 
[normal]that the employer was made an addressee of a fundamental right. 
[normal]   
[normal]Dominguez
[normal] 
[normal]is a further interesting case to consider here.
[normal]  
[normal]In 
[normal]Dominguez
[normal], the 
[normal]issue 
[normal]was whether the 
[normal]Kücükdeveci
[normal] 
[normal]approach could 
[normal]be 
[normal]applied in 
[normal]the context of the right to paid annual leave, 
[normal]on the basis that national law wa
[normal]s contrary to Directive 2003/88
[normal],
[normal] and that this directive 
[normal]simply gave concrete effect to 
[normal]Article 31
[normal](2). 
[normal]The CJEU in that case did not mention Article 31
[normal](2), but did 
[normal]however 
[normal]refuse to 
[normal]grant 
[normal]horizontal direct effect to the directive
[normal]. However,
[normal] AG 
[normal]Trstenjak
[normal] 
[normal]did consider the issue and argued 
[normal]that a
[normal]n application of the 
[normal]Kücükdeveci
[normal] 
[normal]approach 
[normal]would be
[normal] inappropriate
[normal], as 
[normal]she found the social right in Article 31(2) to be of 
[normal]a 
[normal]fundamentally different character 
[normal]to the equality rights, including the right not to be disc
[normal]riminated against in Article 21
[normal](2)
[normal] at issue in 
[normal]Kücükdeveci
[normal].
[normal] This was because, unlike 
[normal]t
[normal]he equality right in Article 21
[normal],
[normal] the social right to annual paid leave 
[normal]cannot function in a freestanding way, but 
[normal]requires 
[normal]further 
[normal]legislative
[normal] action. Directive 2003/88 could only be construed as
[normal] one possible 
[normal]implementation 
[normal]of Article 31
[normal](2)
[normal] and therefore 
[normal]it would be 
[normal]misplaced 
[normal]to 
[normal]transpose 
[normal]the 
[normal]specific 
[normal]content of the directive to the level of primary law 
[normal]by importing it into Article 31
[normal](2).
[normal] To put it differently
[normal], whereas the prohibition of discrimination on account of age was unconditional and sufficiently precise to produce direct effect in 
[normal]Mangold
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]Kücükdeveci
[normal], the right to paid annual leave does not 
[normal]satisfy 
[normal]these 
[normal]conditions.
[normal] 
[normal]The CJEU 
[normal]left it to the national court and legislature to 
[normal]remedy 
[normal]this
[normal] situation
[normal], without granting horizontal effect to the Charter right
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]5. UK [bold]caselaw[bold]: [bold]Benkharbouche[bold] [bold]So much for the CJEU authorities.
[normal] There is also recent UK 
[normal]caselaw
[normal] on this area, namely 
[normal]the important 
[normal]Benkharbouche
[normal] [bold]case of 2013.
[normal] I
[normal]n 
[normal]Benkharbouche
[normal], 
[normal]servants employed 
[normal]at the Sudanese 
[normal]and Libyan 
[normal]embassies in Lond
[normal]on 
[normal]brought a number of claims in the Employment Tribunal, including unfair dismissal, race discrimination and breaches 
[normal]of the 
[normal]EU 
[normal]Working Time Directive. However, t
[normal]heir claims were dismissed under the State Immunity Act 1978 (SIA).
[normal] 
[normal]The c
[normal]lai
[normal]mants appealed, arguing that this
[normal] decision breached their rights of access to a court or tribunal under Article 6 ECHR and Article 47 Charter. 
[normal]   The E
[normal]mployment 
[normal]A
[normal]ppeal 
[normal]T
[normal]ribunal
[normal] held that it was bound by 
[normal]EU law to 
[normal]disapply
[normal] domestic law.
[normal] 
[normal]While the Human Rights Act (
[normal]HRA
[normal])
[normal] could not be used to 
[normal]disapply
[normal] the provisions of the SIA, the 
[normal]EU 
[normal]Charter 
[normal]applies 
[normal]in UK law and, following the CJEU’s decision in 
[normal]Kucukdeveci
[normal], such rights can be enforced directly against private individuals. Therefore, the EAT was bound to 
[normal]disapply
[normal] the provisions of the SIA by reference to the Charter.
[normal]   
[normal]The 
[normal]UK 
[normal]court (
[normal]Langstaff
[normal] P) stressed that the
[normal] obligation to 
[normal]disapply
[normal] the SIA was 
[normal]restricted 
[normal]to issues 
[normal]falling within 
[normal]the material scope of EU law. 
[normal]On that basis, 
[normal]the 
[normal]claims relating to discrimination, harassment and breaches of the 
[normal]EU 
[normal]Working Time Regulations were 
[normal]viable 
[normal]but their claims for unfair dismissal and minimum wage
[normal] were not actionable
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]   
[normal]Benkharbouche
[normal] appears to be 
[normal]the first 
[normal]case in which 
[normal]EU Charter 
[normal]r
[normal]ights 
[normal]have been actionable 
[normal]in a 
[normal]UK 
[normal]dispute between private parties (
[normal]in the slightly strange situation in which 
[normal]although the embassies are state institutions, as an employment dispute the matter is 
[normal]treated as 
[normal]one of private law). 
[normal]    The position may be stated bluntly: although 
[normal]the HRA 
[normal]does not require 
[normal]the disapplication of any 
[normal]statute 
[normal]by any
[normal] UK court
[normal], EU law 
[normal]does require
[normal] it
[normal], even in some cases concerning private parties.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. Conclusion[bold]Both the CJEU and UK authorities have considerable implications for the application of the Charter between private parties. While they indicate that they the Charter may be applied in a number of different ways horizontally, not all of them corresponding to the direct enforceability of Charter rights, they do indicat
[normal]e that the Charter has consider
[normal]able potential to operate in the private sphere.
