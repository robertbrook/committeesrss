[normal]Background[bold]On 8th October 2013 I gave oral evidence at PASC. This short note reflects some of the themes I touched on on that day.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Issue 1: Without [bold]reform there will be a loss of transparency and accountability of government as outsourcing and privatisation expands[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Members of the public and professional journalists make extensive use of the Freedom of Information Act to investigate and understand the
[normal] internal workings of public sector bodies.  I am particularly aware of this as mySociety runs the WhatDoTheyKnow.com website that contains over 180,000 FOI request and a huge number of goverment documents released as replies. This service attracts 300,000
[normal] to 400,000 visitors per month, which helps give an indication of how many people are interested in the public sector’s inner workings.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Companies are not covered by the FOI Act. This represents a real problem to public accountability in situations where c
[normal]ompanies are used to provide public services, instead of government bodies.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My recommendation is that the FOI Act be reformed to ensure that the total amount of accountability about government funded services does not fall as outsourcing and privatisation
[normal] become more common.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Issue 2: Lack of adequate regulation of the trading funds is saddling the wider economy with a growth-draining opportunity cost[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]An ever growing number of companies are dependent (directly or indirectly) on data produced and sold by 
[normal]the UK’s data intensive trading funds.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I have consistently advocated that the significant role the trading funds play in the modern economy should mean that they are regulated independently, by a powerful equivalent to an entity such as Ofgem or Ofcom. I 
[normal]believe that independent, robust regulation is necessary because the senior management of trading funds face systemic incentives to behave in a manner that is bad for the wider economy. In particular, one does not have to know much about economics to know 
[normal]that an entity that has monopoly or near-monopoly supply of some good will tend to price it at a level that drains productive wealth from the wider economy. This behaviour is clearly a danger in the case of any government entity that sells data that is not
[normal] available through other market suppliers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Independent regulation is required to counteract this systemic incentive, which is particularly acute given the lack of markets in the provision of certain datasets that government has exclusive control over.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I 
[normal]have had it made abundantly clear to me by civil servants that the current Government does not believe this level of independent regulation is necessary, and that direct departmental regulation of trading fund activities is more than sufficient. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Nobody h
[normal]as been able to explain to me why we do need independent regulation in semi-competitive markets like gas, but we do not in entirely monopolistic markets, like land registry data. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Issue 3: Open Data will only become widespread if its provision is tied [bold]to the procurement of information systems[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Much of the open data debate is premised on the question ‘is it worth the cost?’. This entirely reasonable question misses the point that if data is authored and maintained properly, then making it ‘open’ is essen
[normal]tially free. And if we can get to a point where open data is virtually free, then the debates about whether it is ‘worth it’ should, in time, melt away.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]But what of the investment required to store data correctly, so that it is cheap to open up? Doesn’t t
[normal]hat represent a cost?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The answer to this is that it does indeed represents a cost, but not a cost beyond the cost of doing business for the government anyway. Government computer systems, like everything the government purchases, get old and ultimately ne
[normal]ed replacing. When this happens, governments spend money on new systems. The question is whether or not those systems will be producing open data ‘off the shelf’, or whether they will need this facility expensively bolting on at some later date.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Consider 
[normal]the following analogy. Constructing a new house to be energy efficient and disabilities friendly is much cheaper and easier than converting and on old house. Similarly, purchasing computer systems that produce open data natively is much easier and cheaper 
[normal]than adapting current systems.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, suppliers will not start to produce ‘off the shelf’ systems that produce open data at low marginal costs if governments (both here and around the world) do not insist that open data feeds are a standard requirement 
[normal]of any system that is not handling solely sensitive private data.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I therefore recommend that Parliament insists on government IT procurement reforms that include in the technical requirements that open data must be produced by new systems at low or zero m
[normal]arginal cost. As a way of ensuring this regulation is adhered to, I also recommend that Parliament legislates to eliminate the cost cap for machine readable data requests made under the Freedom of Information Act. Eliminating this cap (at a specified futur
[normal]e date) will make SROs of IT projects understand that failing to be ‘open data ready’ will cost departments and agencies substantially.
