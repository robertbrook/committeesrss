"&#xa0;\nAFS0030Written evidence submitted by Graham E ConwayThe news is again highlighting the expensive failure of \nFree\n \nSchools\n (Â£6.6 m. each to set) and Academies, under this Government, having departed from the initial intention to bring failing schools under control, before returning them to local authority control\n.\n&#xa0;\nCurrently Academy status\n&#xa0;\nsimply means privatisation by the b\nack door, for profit, resulting in sub-standard teaching by un- or under-qualified staff. \nWe are a long way from when the overriding mantra of the Government was\n \"Education, Education, Education\"\n&#xa0;\nand no Party is\n highlighting the shortcomings of these Acade\nmies at every opportunity and putting forward policies regarding how we will modify the sub-standard teaching post 2015.\n&#xa0;\nI speak from some experience; I was head of an \nIndependent\n \nSchool\n for over 15 years before retiring, caring in the main for forces fa\nmilies' children. Not only were we subject to regular\n&#xa0;\nOfsted inspections, but were regularly inspected by MoD education officials and had to come up to the standard expected by my professional organisation - i.e. HMC etc.\n&#xa0;\nMy daughter has been employed fo\nr three years by a nearby Academy (for her sake I will not name it - suffice it to say it comes from\n&#xa0;\none of the 'better' Companies, \nand she is \nnow concluding \nthe\n first term of her NQT year. Nevertheless, throughout this time she has been employed, unsuperv\nised in the main, on a standard teaching timetable, responsible for exam classes. After Christmas, due to staff vacancies and maternity leave, she will effectively be head of her subject department. The only others in the section have NO teaching qualifica\ntions, one isn't even a graduate, nor are training for such.\n&#xa0;\nLast week alone, in the same School, two members of staff walked out after being humiliated by the Head in front of their students. All Geography and History classes have, since the start of th\ne year, been covered - not by supply staff but by other staff on 'free' periods. No work set, of course, there's no-one employed to set it!\n&#xa0;\nThis is just one example of what I suspect is happening in many so-called Academies around the Country, which are \nputting profits first to the continuing \ndetriment of students' education and future careers. Gove continues with the fallacy that workplace experience is more important that teaching qualifications. [It's a good job the same \ncriterion is\n not used in pickin\ng MPs and the Cabinet.] Is the Labour front bench too embarrassed by its own background to stand up for qualified teachers against this hyped-up \nGovian\n fallacy?\n&#xa0;\nOf course, this is the old \nThatcherite\n Tories all over - privatise everything - put their sup\nporting business interests\n&#xa0;\n and their profits first; but why, oh why \nis \nthis disgraceful policy and Government \nnor being more carefully scrutinised, failure to do so allowing the Government to\n get away with it?\n&#xa0;\nI know there's a cost of living crisis but \nCameron isn't ever going to answer one of Ed\n \nMilliband\n's\n questions on Wednesday lunchtime if he carries on asking about it until \nDomesday\n. \nSomeone needs to take him to task \non education, highlight what is being done to the lives and futures of our children\n all over the country to support Gove's misguided experiment in education.\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
