[[[12A  Recorded rights: revision where unsealed]]]]&#xa0;

[[[Summary of Reasons]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[R1.]]]  There is overwhelming evidence across the nation of damage to highways, of damage to the environment and of risk and nuisance to all other users caused by use of motor vehicles on unsealed ways in the countryside. The problem is acute in National Parks (also in AONBs), and particularly so in the Peak District which has outstanding landscape features and is a lung within the biggest body of population in the country.&#xa0;

[[[R2.]]]  Restraint of recreational motorised use in the countryside is in accord with Government policy (see 'Supplementary information' below).&#xa0;

[[[R3.]]]  The purpose of Clauses 12 - 18 of the Bill (see 'Legislation existing and proposed' below) is to correct loopholes in the rights of way system, in addition to the Bill's primary purposes of reducing red tape and demands on public resources. The PDGLA proposals meet all three objectives.&#xa0;

[[[R4.]]]  Lists of Streets are not records of public rights; they refer only to public maintenance liability.  The only practical way to ascertain what rights exist on ways on the LoS is by determination under s53 Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (the 1981 Act) which normally involves lengthy and expensive procedures.  By letter dated 28 Nov 2006 Defra confirmed this position and urged all surveying authorities to complete determinations ahead of the cut-off  of unrecorded rights of way in Jan 2026 (see 'Supplementary information' below).  PDGLA's proposals give immediate effect to Defra's objective.&#xa0;

[[[R5.  ]]]The combined effect of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CROWA) and the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 (NERCA) is that unrecorded rights for mechanically propelled vehicles (MPVs) are not extinguished at the cut-off in 2026, unlike unrecorded bridleway and footpath rights. In the absence of a formal record of rights, it will not be practicable to bring prosecutions even where MPV rights do not exist.  That means that off-roaders will be able to drive with impunity on UUCRs even though they have no right to be there. The PDGLA proposals remove that unjust anomaly.&#xa0;

[[[R6.  ]]]The proposals recognise the need to protect the "ordinary road network" (Defra's phrase).  Very few UUCRs (commonly known as "green lanes") can be so described, but such cases would be excluded.  So too would ways which are patently bridleways or footpaths.  Exception in such cases could be way of 'designation' by SAs as promoted in Clause 13 of the Bill.&#xa0;

[[[R7.  ]]]The fact that MPV rights may exist historically (generated by the wholly different and ancient use by horse and cart) is no reason to allow the needless desecration of green lanes by increasing recreational use in MPVs, including those run commercially and now being promoted on the internet. This is precisely the reason why the Government introduced NERCA, and why PDGLA extends its proposals to include existing unsealed BOATs. If that is considered to be too draconian (which the public would not) the alternative is to concentrate on situations where the problem is most acute (National Parks and AONBs).&#xa0;

[[[R8.]]]  Clarification of rights on UUCRs needs to include BOAT applications currently being processed, the determination of which should also be limited to RB status.  The precedent for this lies in s67(9) NERCA which limited to RB status applications allowed to be completed under s48(9) CROWA.&#xa0;

[[[R9.  ]]]Use of a "blanket" approach to rights on green lanes (and UUCRs in particular) is directly comparable to the reclassification of RUPPs under CROWA, the extinguishment of MPV rights under NERCA and the proposed cut-off of rights in 2026.  In each case, adequate safeguards were or will be built in to protect significant exceptions.&#xa0;

[[[R10.]]]  Classification of UUCRS as RBs would bring certainty to the rights over such ways long before the cut-off date.  RBs recorded in this way, together with unsealed BOAT s downgraded to RB status, would stand to be protected as such under Clause 12.  Given a recorded status, neither category would need to be designated under Clause 13.&#xa0;

[[[R11.]]]  There is no difficulty in using 'unsealed' as the criterion, as use can be made of the existing definition in s22BB(1)(b)(ii) Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 ("...whose surface, or most of whose surface, does not consist of concrete, tarmacadam, coated roadstone or other prescribed material").&#xa0;

[[[Supplementary information]]]&#xa0;

[[[Government Policy]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;“As Rural Affairs Minister, I have been approached by many individuals and organisations who are deeply concerned about problems caused by the use of mechanically propelled vehicles on rights of way and in the wider countryside. I share these concerns, having seen for myself examples of damage to fragile tracks and other aspects of our natural and cultural heritage in various areas of the country. There is considerable concern about behaviour that causes distress to others seeking quiet enjoyment of the countryside …I do not think that it makes sense that historic evidence of use by horse drawn vehicles or dedications for vehicular use at a time before the internal combustion engine existed can give rise to rights to use modern mechanically propelled vehicles. Those who suffer from vehicle misuse find this incomprehensible and in this paper we offer new proposals that are intended to address what many have come to view as the inappropriate and unsustainable way in which vehicular rights are acquired and claimed on rights of way.”

[[[Legislation - existing and proposed]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;"The incompleteness of the legal record of public rights of way has been a contentioussubject for many years. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 sought to address this.It provided for a ‘cut-off date’ in 2026, so that unrecorded pre-1949 public rights of waywould cease to exist if not specifically preserved by regulations.&#xa0;This has brought into sharp relief the task of capturing on the definitive map and statementbefore that date those currently unrecorded pre-1949 public routes that are already in use,or are useful or potentially useful to the connectivity of the local rights of way network. Itwas an inherent component of the Government’s policy in enacting the cut-off provisionthat such routes should be preserved. However, one major source of concern, for allconcerned, has been the complexity and long-windedness of the recording procedures."&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Outstanding problems]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;"Consequently, any route that on 1 January 2026 is shown on the list of streets but not on the definitive map will have any unrecorded [bridleway or footpath] rights extinguished, subject to the terms of the Countryside &amp; Rights of Way Act 2000.&#xa0;Local authorities are therefore urged to ensure that any unrecorded footpath, bridleway and restricted byway rights are recorded on the definitive map and statement by the cut-off date of 2026, regardless of whether they are also shown on the list required to be kept under section 36(6) of the Highways Act 1980, the 'list of streets' ".&#xa0;&#xa0;"The processes for recording PRoW are complex, slow and resource intensive. This has hampered the recording of all pre1949 rights of way on the definitive map and statement by the deadline of 2026 set out in the Countryside and Rights of Way (CROW) Act 2000 and 2000 Rural White Paper. Government intervention is required in order to simplify the legal/policy framework." (emphasis added).&#xa0;The PDGLA proposals subscribe to that need. In the Peak District National Park alone, the numbers are large and the delay protracted.  In the last 6 years, 21 cases have been determined (but not necessarily finalised) and 80 applications are outstanding. This has necessitated extra staff.  No figures are available nationally.&#xa0;

[[[The opportunity to rectify these problems]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;21 August 20136&#xa0; GLPG is an alliance of the organisations shown below.  Its purpose is to prevent an increase in motor vehicular rights on green lanes. The legal reasoning is explained in a note dated 20 June 2007 from John Riddall, joint author of  'Rights of Way - a Guide to Law and Practice', an authority heavily relied on by the Planning Inspectorate and all those involved in rights of way matters. The letter from Defra dated 28 Nov 2006 is badly worded on this point.
