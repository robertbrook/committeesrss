defaultQ178 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you very much for making the time and the space available for us
default—
defaultobviously causing complete confusion in your office
default.
default I will go around the table and I will ask my colleagues to introduce themselves.
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default I am Clive Brooke, Lord Brooke, a former trade union official
default,
default but I have been in the House of Lords for 16 years now. I am a Labour Peer.
defaultMax Uebedefault: John Monks is also
default there
default.
defaultThe Chairman:default Yes, indeed.
defaultMax Uebedefault: I used to work with him a lot when I was in the Cabinet
default.
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default Yes, John is a frequent speaker in the House of Lords.
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default David Wilson. I am an independent 
defaultC
defaultross
default-B
defaultench Peer. I have been about 20 years in the House of Lords
default. My career was 
defaultin public service, to some extent universities and some industry.
defaultLord Freeman:default Roger Freeman, a Conservative Life Peer, having served also in the House of Commons for 15 years, 
defaultbut 
defaultI am 15 years now in the House of Lords.
defaultMax Uebedefault: That is possible? Apologies for my ignorance.
defaultThe Chairman:default Not simultaneously.
defaultLord Freeman:default Not simultaneously, you can move on from the Commons.
defaultMax Uebedefault: So if you move from the Commons, you are—
defaultThe Chairman:default You are a Lord.
defaultThe Chairman:default The difference between us is that, of course, in the Commons they are elected.
defaultMax Uebedefault: That I am aware of.
defaultLord Freeman:default And we are appointed.
defaultQ179 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultI 
defaultam 
defaultDetta O'Cathain
default. I
default have been in the House for 23 years. I came through the business route not the political route, but I sit on the Conservative 
defaultB
defaultenches.
default Of 
defaultcourse you know Dominique Gracia
default,
default who has organised all of this.
defaultWe started this inquiry taking witness statements from October last year, although it seems a long time ago. We are doing it on the basis of our remit as a 
defaultS
defaultub
default-C
defaultommittee of the European Union Select Committee in the House of Lords to scrutinise
default.
default 
defaultW
defaulte have three specific areas: the internal market, infrastructure and employment. We have done various reports since this Parliament began. We have a five-year Parliament span and we are just towards the end of the fourth year. We have done things like women on boards, innovation and research and the Channel Tunnel. So you can see the disparate types of work we do.
defaultWe decided to look at youth unemployment because without doubt it is probably the most serious problem facing the European Union. There are some countries that are managing to sort it out.
defaultWe have taken evidence from all sorts of people. We have taken statements from 
defaultyoung people
default themselves, which was a really good thing that we did. 
defaultW
defaulte had two very interesting sessions: one in Birmingham and one in Liverpool. We found just how 
defaultdifficult
default it is out there, with the interaction of social problems
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe real problem is that
default, 
defaultwhile some people can be unemployed and then pick themselves up and get into the labour market, and then have careers and go steaming on
default, 
defaultsome of these people are without hope. I do not think they can see it on their radar screen. Then there are the implications of that not only for the people themselves, who are going to have a much worse life than other people born at the same time as them in different circumstances, but there are the social implications
default—
defaultriots and all sort of things. We have seen very little of it in the United Kingdom
default—it does not happen every weekend—but 
defaultit is destabilising and very upsetting for those who have tried to do something about it. 
defaultT
defaulthat is one of the major problems.
defaultWe also took evidence from business on the day-to-day operations of things like apprenticeships and that was very helpful. 
defaultT
defaulthere are definitely some areas we can look at that are going to help us throughout.
default 
defaultNow we have decided that, as it was the European Union, we had better come here. It is the first time our Committee ha
defaults 
defaulttaken evidence 
defaultin 
defaultBrussels
default in this Parliament, so 
defaultwe are very grateful to you. We have a series of questions that you have been given in advance.
default M
defaulty first question is: to what extent do you see the issue as being about the demand side
default—
defaultthe availability of jobs
default—
defaultand to what extent is 
defaultit 
defaultthe supply side: how well young people are prepared for the labour market, in terms of skills and education, the point really being their employability?
defaultMax Uebedefault: First, let me thank you for coming over and for your interest. We very much look forward to your final report. It is when?
defaultThe Chairman:default April 2014, just a couple of months.
defaultMax Uebedefault: So a couple of months to go. When I started in the Cabinet with Commissioner Andor’s predecessor, Commissioner 
defaultŠ
defaultpid
defaultl
defaulta, there was a report by the House of Lords on labour law. It was early days for me and I was not involved very much but I remember the high quality of the report, which was very much appreciated. Our relations with the 
defaultUK
default are not always the easiest, so also in this context we look forward to the report based on the sound evidence that you have collected, which perhaps can also help the debate from our point of view. 
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultThank you for that comment. That is very important. Thank you.
defaultMax Uebe:default On your question on demand and supply
default, we 
defaulttry to address it from both angles. There is clearly both a demand side and a supply side problem in most member states. Of course it is dangerous to generalise because the situation across the European Union is very diverse. It is no secret. If you look at the map, at the Mediterranean countries, in 
defaultGreece
default and 
defaultSpain
default youth unemployment is up to almost 60%, whereas in the centre it 
defaultis 
default4% or 5%. In general, we try to address the fact that young people without the right skills will never have a chance. You mention young people who are caught in this cycle of unemployment over generations. They will not have the opportunity to enter the labour market to find sustainable labour market attachment. Obviously, on the other side, what we always say is that, whatever we do here in terms of apprenticeship reform, the Youth Guarantee and so on, it will not work if the economy as a whole is not picking up. We are not naive. Without that it will not be possible. But our objective is to at least have young people ready and prepared for jobs that hopefully will come up soon
default,
default because there is some light now at the end of the tunnel. Recovery is coming. The big question is: will it be a jobless recovery or will there be new jobs? I would argue that it is both. It is very important.
defaultIf you look at the Youth Guarantee—and I assume you have looked at the recommendation behind the Youth Guarantee—this is our flagship in the unit. This is our umbrella for all the policy measures we take in the fight against youth u
defaultnemployment. It can be argued that 
defaultthere 
defaultyou have both in a way. There is a recommendation to reinforce youth entrepreneurship. You can use money from the 
defaultyouth employment initiative
default—this €6 billion package—to finance recruitment or wage subsidies, and a large part of course is upskilling and so on. We try to tackle both
default,
default the Commissioner will argue. 
defaultPerhaps I should say here, in brackets, that it 
defaultis not usual for me to speak to you before you speak to the Commissioner. It is not the most normal or pleasant
default way. It is a bit tricky.
defaultThe Chairman:default For you?
defaultMax defaultUebedefault: Yes, of course, because I do not 
defaultwant
default you to say later on, “But Max said so and so”
default.
defaultThe Chairman:default We will not.
defaultMax Uebedefault: I also like to keep questions more on a technical level. For example, this is a question that the Commissioner would love to address. He is an economist and he thinks a lot about these macroeconomic questions as well.
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you. Does anyone want to comment on any points that Mr Uebe has mentioned? The thing that struck me is what you said about this total commitment to the flagship policy, which is the Youth Guarantee.
defaultQ180 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default On the second question, I would like to tease you out a little on the Commission’s programme for developing standards for training and apprenticeship quality. As you know, there is quite a focus in the 
defaultUK
default on returning to what we had 20 or 30 years ago, which were quality apprenticeships. We are now trying to very substantially increase the number of young people undergoing apprenticeships. Could you explain a little bit more
default what you believe that centrally
default—without any question there is a role for you—
defaultyou can contribute
default, because there is such a diverse application of apprenticeships between one nation and another? Are you hoping to achieve minimum standards or a minimum quality? Do you think it is possible or preferable to give a general exhortation that people should be moving in this direction but leave it to them to develop the systems as they see appropriate to their own circumstances? 
defaultMax Uebe:default First, we have to clearly distinguish between traineeships and apprenticeships. Those are dealt with here in the unit by two different people. 
defaultI should say, in brackets, to give you an idea that we 
defaultare the policy unit working on youth unemployment. You mentioned that 
defaultthis 
defaultis one of the biggest problems in the European Union
default,
default but we have 3.5 people working on that. 
defaultI say that t
defaulto give you an idea. We have staff cuts and I just managed to get one additional post. But, given the magnitude of the problem, it is always interesting to see the reaction of people 
defaultwhen 
defaultI give this information. It is quite something. We have one colleague working on traineeships. Of course they cover other issues as well but mainly traineeships
default and 
defaultapprenticeships
default,
default and another is working on the Youth Guarantee. So we have to distinguish between apprenticeships and traineeships.
defaultWe are fully aware of the differences between member states. There is no one-size-fits-all approach. It simply does not work. In particular, 
defaultwhen you look at apprenticeship
default schemes, we have different traditions. You cannot compare countries, like 
defaultGermany
default, 
defaultAustria
default or 
defaultSwitzerland
default. Their systems have grown over decades if not centuries. Then you have member states—let us take 
defaultSpain
default or 
defaultPortugal
default—that want to build up a system. It is a very, very difficult task because there are so many different players: there are the links with educational institutions and you have to get businesses and trade unions on board. We are starting from a very low point in these countries. 
defaultThe European Alliance for Apprenticeships was launched in July. One of its main objectives is, first, to change the mindsets of those member states that do not have apprenticeship schemes yet. That means the mindsets of the companies. If you speak to an Italian company they will tell you, “Why should I have an apprentice? He or she will leave after finishing the apprenticeship and go to my competitor”. When we speak to the trade unions they say, “This is exploitation of young people because they are paid much less”. When we speak to young people
default,
default they prefer to go to a construction site and earn three times as much now in the short term, and you speak to the parents and they say, “It is much more prestigious if my daughter and my son go to university”. So there is a big, big mindset problem to start with.
defaultYou also asked about the European role. What we try to do with the European alliance is to bring a lot of pilot projects that are taking place under the European umbrella. There is a lot of interest in many member states 
defaultin doing 
defaultsomething. I have told you that I have been working for a long time in the area of employment and social affairs. I can tell you that usually member states say, “This is not our business. We do a little bit here and there”. This is the one of first times I have seen a real, genuine interest on the part of member states to learn from each other and build up something that works in other member states. Why are apprenticeships so much in vogue these days? It might be a coincidence, but if you look at the map the member states that have well
default 
defaultestablished apprenticeship schemes usually have relatively low youth unemployment rates. 
defaultMy personal opinion is 
defaultthat 
defaultI am a bit sceptical. For me, the apprenticeship scheme is not a panacea. It can help to develop the right skills but it will not solve the dramatic level of youth unemployment. It can be a step. We have all these pieces, like a mosaic, and an apprenticeship is an important part.  But if you speak to some Ministers from some of the countries that want to establish a scheme, they believe that if they establish a system everything will be fine. There is also some scepticism on this side. From our point of view, what is very important is to involve the social partners and the employers when drawing up curricula for the apprenticeships. Successful schemes have that. Only then will young people acquire the skills and the competencies that are needed in the market. It is very important to have a connect between what the market needs, which employers can tell you best, and what the young people will learn.
defaultThis is on the apprenticeship scheme, and while we have some declarations on minimum standards, and some idea of what a good traineeship would look like, we are far from setting standards as we do now in the other area of apprenticeships. In December the Commission adopted a proposal for a European quality framework on traineeships that we are currently negotiating with member states. Like the Youth Guarantee it is in the form of a Council recommendation, so it is not binding but recommending member states to ensure a number of things. There we start with the kind of standard that we would like to see
default. E
defaultvery trainee 
defaultshould have 
defaultat least a written traineeship agreement setting out a number of issues
default—
defaultfor example, the length of the traineeship. We want to ensure that there are learning objectives during the traineeship. We want to avoid repetitive traineeships because there is a major concern that young people are caught in a number of traineeships even with the same employer. In terms of setting standards, we are further advanced than in the area of apprenticeships because there again the apprenticeship system is much more complicated. In 
defaultGermany
default the traditions are different. There are many more players involved
default—
defaultthe chambers, employers and educational institutions. That is a broad overview.
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you very much.
defaultQ181 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Freeman:default It is difficult for me to read the map, but could you give us some examples of how different countries are using the 
defaultyouth employment initiative
default?
defaultMax Uebe:default That is a very important and interesting question. We are also interested in learning more about that. You may be aware that we are at the very beginning of everything
default and
default as often happens—I always forget that this is being recorded—things are delayed. We are doing our best but the negotiations on this instrument between the Council and Parliament took a long time. You might be aware that member states have benefited from this money. They were supposed to submit plans—so called Youth Guarantee 
defaultemployment plans
default—by the end of the year. These plans are currently 
defaultbeing 
defaultassessed by colleagues
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthey also indicate what member states have in mind to do. There are examples
default,
default but I am not allowed yet to give you concrete examples or mention specific member states. But I mentioned, for example, the wage and recruitment subsidies; apprenticeship reforms are being financed; entrepreneurship support is an issue. Also, in the context of mobility, again the map is quite useful. Obviously mobility can be short-term relief for young people in the south
default,
default because there is a high demand for skilled labour at least in the centre. So, to facilitate mobility, how could you do that? You could finance a language course or help with an allowance to enable someone to move and so on. These are issues that could and will be financed, but we do not have a clear idea of what member states want to do. We can get back to you as soon as we have—
defaultLord Freeman:default 
defaultWh
defaulten could we have the information of what different member states are doing
default?
defaultMax Uebe:default We will give the first feedback to member states starting in the week beginning 3 February.
defaultThe Chairman:default I see, in two weeks’ time.
defaultMax defaultUebedefault:
default T
defaulto
default be fully transparent
default, the 
defaultplans that have come in are now with the ESF country desk. They do a first assessment. Also other DGs contribute: DG 
defaultEAC and
default DG 
defaultECFIN
default, because all of that has an important budget
defaultary
default financial impact. They are particularly interested in the programme—
defaultLord Freeman:default What sort of timescale do you think would apply for our Select Committee to be briefed on what different member states are doing?
defaultMax Uebe:default One tricky question we will address, hopefully today or tomorrow, is
default whether we can 
defaultmake these plans public or not
default.
default Already the first request—
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultYes, we have heard a rumour.
defaultMax defaultUebedefault: Yes. Yesterday 
defaultI
default attended a meeting of a think tank here. They have set up a task force. A colleague from the OECD said, “We want to see these plans”. I told him we will ask our member states and if they agree we can pass them on. If not, it is possible to formally request access to documents. I do not see any reason to justify a rejection. The rules are extremely generous for the public to request that. I think we have had the first request
default, which is I think from 
defaultIreland
default.
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default We heard the Irish have gone in.
defaultMax Uebe:default No, someone has requested access to the Irish employment implementation plan.
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default I am with you, yes.
defaultMax Uebe:default But as you can imagine, i
defaultt
default can be tricky for member states because journalists also do that. You have an overview of member states and how much money they are willing to put into the fight against youth unemployment. I can imagine a nice story could be made out of that.
defaultLord Freeman:default But in due course 
defaultwill 
defaultthe information be available
default,
default because I think it is directly relevant to our report
default?
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultYes
default. We really need the information in the next four weeks.
defaultMax Uebe:default What exactly do you need? What kind of measures are financed in which country or in general or—
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultYes
default.
defaultLord Freeman:default Also the nature of the approach, the nature of the plans.
defaultQ182 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default The EU’s role is to co-ordinate and to share best practice, and o
defaultne of the 
defaultcriticisms that we hear is 
defaultthat 
defaultpeople ask, “But where does it actually happen? How do you get access to see what is happening elsewhere, when they do not release information as freely as perhaps they ought to do?” We would like to leave the point with you. I take the issue that you can have newspapers interfering and running stories and using it for their own particular ends, but overall I think this is a major initiative for the Commission and for the EU generally. If they could try some new initiatives on openness, I think you would only benefit from it rather than be seen to say, “We cannot do that. We would like to do it but we cannot do it”. Why does it not go on the net? If the plans go in
default,
default why are they not made public so that people can then say, “There is a good idea there for us to consider”
default?
defaultThe Chairman:default Exactly. This is the point because with 28 member states I am sure there are going to be at least 40 different ideas, and some of them would be directly relevant to the problems that some other member state might have.
defaultMax Uebe:default We fully agree that there should be full transparency, but it is a problem that we have with the member states. When it comes to best practice and sharing, you might be aware of a range of what we call 
defaultmutual learning programmes
default, MLP
defaults
default. We had a big seminar on the Youth Guarantee here in October, in La Hulpe. There was one on early intervention I think in 
defaultThe Hague
default. There is one on Youth Guarantee implementation. Soon there will be another 
defaultmutual learning programme 
defaultin 
defaultFinland
default. So for member states at least—and you know we also have Youth Guarantee co-ordinators appointed in all member states—there is a lot 
defaultof 
defaultexchange. We had an EMCO automatic review
default—by
default the Employment Committee
default—i
defaultn early December where perhaps 10 to 12 member states presented what they do, and then there is always a discussion with other member states coming in and commenting. At that level at least there is a lot of exchange. When it comes to the wider public, I agree it could be better.
defaultThe Chairman:default I have just been reminded that we have five minutes left
default, so 
defaultI just make the point at this stage that if you have the sort of information that you think might help us to support our views—and I think you can see where we are tracking to—it would be very useful if you could send us some stuff. 
defaultQ183 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default defaultCan
default you clarify the role of the European Social Fund in dealing with youth unemployment and the Youth Guarantee? The memo put out by the Commission in November says, “It is important that member states devote a significant proportion of their European Social Fund allocations for 2014-20 to implementing the Youth Guarantee”. How do you see the ESF fitting in
default?
default 
defaultC
defaultan I try to get my mind clear? The suggestions are made by the Council as recommendations. They are not binding. The money is given out by the Commission. That means the Commission is saying, “Okay, this idea is good and we will support it. That idea is not good, we will not support it”. So there is a great deal of power there in the Commission of what—
defaultMax Uebe:default Ideally, yes, but with shared management you have to agree with a member state. In general, when it comes to the fund, we try to introduce what we call 
defaultex ante 
defaultconditionality. We want to make payments conditional. This is
default, in my personal view, in the interest not only 
defaultof the Commission but also of a number of member states. At least we can control in a certain way where the money goes. When it comes to EU funding of the Youth Guarantee, first, we say the Youth Guarantee needs national funding. EU funding alone will not suffice. Then you have to distinguish between the 
defaultyouth employment initiative—
defaultthe €6 billion package, two years’ short-term Youth Guarantee
default—
defaultand the ESF, 
defaultwith 
defaultmuch larger amounts, 
defaultfor 
defaultmuch longer and covering all member states because
default. As 
defaultyou see from th
defaultis year’s
default money
default,
default a number of member states do not benefit at all. So this is an i
defaultmportant difference between the two.
defaultQ184 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default This has been a terrific session and thank you very much indeed. I know you only have three and a half people, but I wonder if the half person could look at the questions that you had notice of and see if they can give us any more information.
defaultOn a final note, 
defaultand 
defaultthis is a psychological sort of problem 
defaultfor us 
defaultin the United Kingdom—and I am not speaking for the United Kingdom but I can understand where they are coming from—one of the points is: why is the EU so prescriptive? Why do you take this role and not allow more flexibility? Can you consider that
default,
default because I am thinking about what is going to happen when our report comes out
default?
default I am also thinking that we have a situation in the 
defaultUK
default at the moment 
defaultthat 
defaultis slightly tricky. I think that one of the advantages for the pro-European 
defaultside, so to speak, 
defaultwould be if 
defaultthey
default could point to something that is really likely to work, but not without the great hand of the EU getting right into the dross of the business.
defaultMax Uebe:default I am not so sure that we are overly prescriptive. Again, 
defaulton 
defaultour flagship
default,
default the Youth Guarantee, we have recommendation number one, which is the core. 
defaultMember 
defaultstates are committed to ensure that all young people up to 25 have 
defaultthis 
defaultwithin four months. How they achieve it, honestly we do not care at all. What counts for us is the outcome
default, which is that 
defaultideally young people are not for longer than four months on the streets
default or
default in the suburbs
default, for example
default. If you call that prescriptive
default, fine
default. There then follow a number of guidelines and recommendations on how to achieve this objective. Again, when it comes to monitoring the implementation of the Youth Guarantee, what we will look at is the outcome
default,
default and how a member state achieves that honestly I do not care at all. Obviously there should be a certain quality in the jobs and 
defaulttraining and 
defaultso on, but your tools, your ideas, where to put the money—
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you. 
defaultA
defaultll of this is being transcribed. You will get a copy of the transcript, which you can correct. Please keep in touch
