"Written evidence from Police and Crime Commissioner, Thames Valley [CST0038]Response to Public Administration Select Committee request for evidence on Crime Statistics In response to questions raised by the Chairman of PASC in his letter of 6th December 2013, Thames Valley PCC’s response is as follows:What, if any, targets do you set for your police force? What impact do you think this has on police recording practices?For 2013-14, \nI have \nset five\n ‘headline’ targets. Two of these (\nBurglary Dwelling and Violence against the Person) are Crime Reduction Targets. The other three are detection targets (Burglary Dwelling, Rape Offences, and Violence against the Person with Injury). \nI have also set \na number of o\nther \nkey \ncrime reduction \ntargets\n, \nsuch as \nRural Crime, \nM\netal \nT\nheft and \nD\nisrupting Organised Crime Groups\n. \nWe are still in quarter 3 of the current performance year and it \nis difficult to say with \nany \nprecision \nwhat the true impact of PCC target setting has ha\nd on police recording practices\n. \nTh\ne \ncurrent \nset of ‘headline’ targets for T\nhames \nV\nalley \nP\nolice\n has\n, on the whole\n, been\n challenging for the Force\n. T\nhe backdrop to deliver\ning\n \nthese is\n set against continuing\n reduction\ns in budget and resource\n.\n \n However, the Force has for many \nyears\n \nalso \nresponded \npositively \nto ch\nallenging targets set by the previous Police Authority.\n \nThames Valley received a positive\n \nassessment \nfrom HMIC \nof its data integrity back in 2011. The cornerstones for this \nwere based upon strong \nleadership \nthat focused on ethical recording, along with good practices for recording crime consistently and accurately.\n \n \nI have no reason to believe that the Force h\nas departed from these policies and practices.\nW\nhilst we are conscious that some PCC’s have followed the government’s line of \nintroducing \na single \ntarget for ‘reducing all crime’,\n this \nin itself\n can create a \nnumber \nof \nperverse\n outcomes. \nWe have \ndiscussed \nfuture target setting\n with our local HMIC and i\nt has been \nsuggested that a limit\ned basket of \nkey \ntargets \ncan be\n appropriate in addressing \nareas \nwhich \nrequire focused \nperformance imp\nrovement\n. \n&#xa0;\nHow do you assure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct? To what extent can you trust the crime statistics for your area?I h\nave \nattempted to answer\n \nth\nis \nquestion through our initial \nevidence submitted\n to th\ne\n Committee \n(\nvia \nthe APCC)\n in November\n 2013\n.\n This can be \nviewed\n \nat \nhttp://data.parliament.u\nk\n/writtenevidence/WrittenEvidence.svc/EvidenceHtml/3532\n \nWithin \nThames Valley, \nI hold\n the\n \nChief Constable to \na\nccount for \nd\nelive\nring the Police and Crime Plan \nand\n/or \nfor ensuring \naccountability for\n the efficient\n and \neffective\n \ndirection and \ncontrol of the Force\n. These\n \n‘\nboundaries\n’ help reduce \nmy \nexposure to, and involvement in, \nthe \noperational \n‘\nmicro-detail\n’\n of crime \nstatistics\n. \nBy \nfocusing \non crime \nstatistics at a \n‘\nmacro-level\n’\n, \nI have \na \nricher-picture that \nenables more objective understanding\n \nof \nkey \nperformance r\nisks and issues wit\nhin the \nForce.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nMy Office regularly monitors timely performance data to identify trends (through \nthe Home Office ‘\niQuanta\n’ Performance Management System\n) and comparisons are carried out with other forces.  \nI\nnternal performance reviews\n from the Force\n, \ncoupled \nwith \nexternal\n q\nualitative/quantitative performance information\n \nsources\n,\n are triangulated \nto provide \nan \nindependent\n perspective.\nI would like to underline\n HMIC’s previous assessment of the Force\n’\ns\n data integrity in\n which \ngood \nethical recording and high \ncrime \nrecording standards were \nacknowledged. I am confident that the Force continues to maintain these standards.\n \nHowever, \nI do have a concern that fraud, and cyber enabled crime is increasing, and we do not have an accurate measurement of this as it is reported direct to Action Fraud. We have little feedback on the extent of it within Thames Valley, but I believe that, in monetary terms, it is by far the largest crime both within the Thames Valley Police area. I believe this to be the case nationally.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n20\n December 2013\n"
