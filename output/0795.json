"Written evidence from the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (LTC 47)Introduction:Hospitals are seeing increasing number of medical admissi\nons.\n \nThe increase in numbers is\n multifactorial with demographic changes accounting for less than half of this rise.\nAs hospitals decrease their bed n\numbers, they must reduce their length of stay (L\noS\n)\n to compensate. This LoS needs to drop even furthe\nr due to increasing admissions.\n \nAs a consequence of this\n,\n elderly p\natients may\n leave hospital with poorer functional capacity and fail in the community\n.\n \nThis leads to\n re-admission and the creation of a vicious cycle \nthat may ultimately lead\n to 24 hour care.\nThe key to assessm\nent of the older person is the C\nomprehensive Geriatric \nA\nssessment (CGA) carried ou\nt by the multidisciplinary team including the consultant.\n \nGeriatricians a\nre now one of the largest medical \nspecialities in the UK and they\n provide significant input into acute GIM on call. \nOver the last few years there has \nbeen a shift of resources from secondary\n care to primary care.\n \nA greater emphasis has been placed on preventative care in the community.\n \nHowever, the\nre are challenges set in the most at risk population in primary care.\n \nThese \nare\n:\n(i)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMultiple \nco-\nmorbidity\n(ii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPolypharmacy\n(iii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCognitive impairment/\ndementia\n(iv)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAssessment of capacity\n(v)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLegal and ethical issues\n(vi)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCarer support\n(vii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPalliative and End of life care\nGeneral practitioners have been set up to provide preventative care, with the creation of Q\nuality \nO\nutcome \nF\nramework\ns\n (\nQoFs\n)\n.\n \nHowever, th\ne evidence to say that QoFs have a significant effect in improving care\n is limited (Cochrane data base Sept 2011).\n \nGood primary care also involves the rational use of hospital based resources which is achieved through the GP gate keeping role. Unfortunately, the new GP contract and the loss of normal out of hours care means that for\n a significant part of the week\n an elderly person will not be looked after by their primary health care team.\nIntermediate care (IC) was first described in the literature in 1985, \nand \nover the years many different models of intermediate care have been\n proposed/\ndeveloped.\n \nThe evidence for supporting intermediate care is variable and the studies are small, with different outcomes being looked at and with diff\nering methodologies being used.\n \nTherefore this makes \ngeneralisable\n conclusions problematic in suggesting that intermediate care can be used to stem hospital admissions.\nThere is\n,\n however\n,\n clearly an opportunity to shift\n \nfocus more into the community.\n \nHospital clinics in all specialties are full of patients on long term follow up for ‘review and monitoring’.\n \nThis can only be successful if there are clear pathways for patients and properly supportive networks across the care sectors. \nAnswers:&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nMay 2013\n"
