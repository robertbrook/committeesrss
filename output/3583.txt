[[[&#xa0;]]]                                                                       SUMMARY&#xa0;8   The 3 hour journey target – London - Scotland&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The objectives are clear, the solution offered by HS2, is wrong. A new North – South Railway must double capacity on the East &amp; West Coast routes whilst offering direct services to the continent from The Midlands and The North of England to encourage the switch from the plane to the train to reduce carbon emissions.The new railway must take the rare opportunity to construct ‘through London’ services to connect the north and the south of the country. In the heart of the capitol it must provide excellent connectivity with CROSSRAIL services to Heathrow Airport, The City and Canary Wharf as well as to London Underground services.&#xa0;&#xa0;The design of the route means ALL trains from London will call at Birmingham, making the route between the capitol and Leeds illogical, and the journey between Leeds and the continent, absurd.It is planned for HS2 trains to depart from Leeds, travel south west to Birmingham, continue past Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, travel through Hillingdon, Ruislip and Acton in West London, enter a Victorian tunnel around North London to Stratford in East London, before joining HS1 tracks to Folkestone and the Channel Tunnel!Little wonder the airlines are unconcerned by HS2 – the train offers no serious threat to the seventy minute flight from Leeds/ Bradford to Paris.It should be remembered a part of the justification of the cost of HS2 is the reduction in carbon emissions. As the route of HS2 will ensure no reduction in flights to the near continent the claim is spurious.&#xa0;The Prime Minister insists there is absolutely no alternative to HS2. With all due respect to Mr Cameron, he is wrong!    &#xa0;&#xa0;Starting in the very heart of the capitol (possibly at the new £1bn Tottenham Court Road CROSSRAIL Station) four tracks, in tunnels for eight miles beneath North London, follow the traditional transport corridor of the M1 Motorway.Near Junction 19, the tracks diverge, with one route following the M6 to Birmingham and Manchester whilst the other route follows the M1 to East Midlands Parkway and Leeds.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;A triangle design, where the tracks diverge, enables superb connectivity between towns and cities in The Midlands and The North of England.&#xa0;&#xa0;As the railway is below ground in London it allows for a spur to Kings Cross/St Pancras as well as a short link, from north of Kings Cross station, to HS1 tracks providing attractive ‘through’ services from The North to the Continent.A connection with LONDON OVERGROUND services at Finchley Road contributes to a reduction in potential overcrowding in the central London station whilst providing passengers with numerous onward journey options.&#xa0;&#xa0;The trains are generally restricted to 140mph, except where straight sections of track permit a higher speed, but are capable of speeds of 200mph when operating on the continent. &#xa0;&#xa0;225mph (the projected speed of HS2) is a little less than four miles per minute. 140mph (on average the speed of EAST &amp; WEST COAST 2 trains) is a little less than two and half miles per minute.The time difference for a 100 mile journey is ten minutes!&#xa0;&#xa0;Unlike France, Spain and China, our towns and cities are relatively close together and 225mph trains are neither necessary nor justified.&#xa0;&#xa0;It is effectively TWO Railways, with the section between London and Junction 19 in Leicestershire, running parallel.The design permits twenty four trains per hour (twelve between London &amp; Manchester via Birmingham and twelve between London &amp; Leeds via East Midlands Parkway) when running five minutes apart.HS2, by comparison, permits twelve trains per hour (six between London &amp; Manchester via Birmingham and six between London &amp; Leeds via Birmingham).Put another way, assuming a loading of 800 per train, HS2 will carry 9,600 passengers per hour at peak operation.East &amp; West Coast 2 will carry almost 20,000!If, as government claims, capacity is the major issue when it comes to investing in the future of our railways, HS2 comes a poor second!&#xa0;&#xa0;November 2013 &#xa0;
