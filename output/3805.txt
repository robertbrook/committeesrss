[[[Written evidence from the British Beer and Pub Association (CYS 051)]]]&#xa0;The British Beer &amp; Pub Association (BBPA) is the leading organisation representing the brewing and pub sector. Our members account for 96% of beer brewed in the United Kingdom and own around half of Britain's 49,500 public houses&#xa0;We  write in response to your follow-up inquiry on cycling safety, in particular, your question; ‘Whether it would be desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from other road users, including, for example, by prohibiting HGVs from entering city centres at peak hours.’&#xa0;City centre businesses, particularly those offering food, are dependent on daily deliveries to ensure they can operate without disruption.  Pubs situated in city locations are no different and are heavily reliant on daily deliveries, of both food and beer, collection of empty kegs and require access for company technical support staff. &#xa0;Segregated cycle lanes already cause particular issues for pub deliveries. Manual handling of bulk beer containers such as kegs and casks (as specified in current Health &amp; Safety Regulations) ideally requires the delivery vehicle to be sited at the kerb-side outside the premises. Physically segregated lanes prevent this access and in some circumstances, bulk containers must be wheeled across the cycle lane which poses a further risk to both cyclists and delivery drivers.&#xa0;There are already significant restrictions imposed on delivery vehicles, including the enforcement of permitted delivery times (night time deliveries are not allowed), access routes and parking restrictions. Whereas it may be desirable to separate road users to protect those considered more vulnerable, further restrictions could seriously hinder the ability to deliver to pubs, particularly if this were to prevent deliveries during busy trading periods, i.e. lunchtimes.  Imposing such restrictions could also lead to increased, inefficient journey times as all deliveries would be squeezed into a shorter time window.  This in itself would lead to wider congestion issues.&#xa0;Relaxing some of the existing restrictions could potentially ease traffic load at key periods such as peak commuting time, and would, in practice, offer a degree of segregation. In particular, easing the existing night-time restrictions on delivery times, as permitted during the 2012 Olympic Games, could optimise the efficiency of deliveries and could result in reduced concentration of delivery vehicles on the road at peak times.&#xa0;The brewing industry supports safer measures for all road users to reduce the potential for incidents.  However, where further, physical segregation of road use is proposed, we would emphasise that the road system is critical for the functioning of businesses in towns and cities, particularly London. &#xa0;The BBPA would be pleased to be involved in any ongoing discussions with TfL, DfT and others on this issue.&#xa0;&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;1&#xa0;
