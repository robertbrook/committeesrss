defaultQ1 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Good morning. This is the first session of the Committee’s major inquiry into the future of the BBC in anticipation of charter renewal. As our first witnesses, I welcome David Elstein, Chairman of openDemocracy.net, Claire Enders, the founder of Enders Analysis and Steve Hewlett who works for the Guardian and presents Radio 4’s “The 
defaultMedia Show
default”.
default              
defaultTo start off, could you give a general overview about how you see the place of the BBC, whether or not it is meeting its stated public purposes and to what extent we need to consider changes for the duration of the next charter?
defaultClaire Endersdefault: My view is that the BBC is for its stakeholders—including me—who are licence fee payers. It is accounting for a third of media consumption in the world’s most competitive and demanding market because of its just desserts. My evidence is focused on the delivery of a very wide range of products that the BBC delivers extraordinarily well, in the teeth of extraordinary competition that, as we know, is increasing every year. To my mind, the BBC is also the underpinning of the most remarkable success story in the creative economy, which is based on a very demanding consumption profile with most individuals here, with 85% broadband penetration, using a very wide range of media and also a very large range of device ownership, tablets and smart phones included. At every turn the BBC has made itself relevant on every platform—perhaps not as cost-effectively as we would all like but eventually it has got there.
default              
defaultI think that the core of the BBC’s ethos is public service broadcasting. As someone who chose to become British and to cease to be anything else, including American, I have here a profound philosophical engagement with public service broadcasting. So this is an institution that I and many other people support. Public service broadcasting is—in contrast to the views of David Elstein—a public service for all and available to access.
default              
defaultI do not perceive there to be any necessity, either in relation to the functioning of the creative economy or indeed in relation to media consumption patterns, as they exist and as they are predictable, for any material change in the outputs of the BBC in terms of its product set. I believe that there is widespread support in the population for my view. Public service broadcasting still accounts for 75% of viewing many, many years after the dawn of the internet. Therefore, we are all baked in to an extraordinary cultural phenomenon that gives us “
defaultSherlock
default” and Sir David Attenborough as well as many other things that other people enjoy more than I do.
defaultChair:default High marks. David.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: Chairman, members of the Committee, good morning to you. I am not quite sure which of my views Claire was referring to that she was hoping to contrast herself with, but I am going to embarrass her by saying I am a great admirer and strong supporter of the BBC. Despite its rather sad couple of years—mostly suffering self-inflicted wounds—it remains a major success story. As one of its recent senior executives, Roger Mosey, said, “Probably too successful in some ways for its good and our”. That is something I hope this Committee takes cognisance of—that there is a price for success as well as a price for failure.
default              
defaultAs I said in my written submission, most of the things that we could talk about in terms of changing the BBC are not going to change it very much. Even if the BBC Trust were to be abolished and a better governance system brought in—which seems to me a fairly easy recommendation for this Committee to make—I do not think it would change very much in terms of how the BBC functions. At its core the BBC is a creative organisation, thousands of people making programmes, doing journalism, entertaining the masses. What happens on whichever floor that management currently is on, let alone senior management of the Trust, does not greatly affect them other than occasionally depressing them, as when we had the spectacle of the 9 September meeting with the Public Accounts Committee, where members of the current and past Trust and executive board tried to blame each other for something that was not that important in the overall scheme of things but was a huge embarrassment.
default              
defaultAll that said, I do think sometimes we ask the wrong questions here. With great respect, Chairman, I think you have asked the wrong question in the first place. It is not the stated public purposes of the BBC that really count. We can all set ourselves things that we know we are going to do. There cannot be a single programme the BBC transmits that does not fulfil one or other of the public purposes. That is the whole point of having them—that you cannot fail the test. I once asked Ofcom which of the BBC’s self-stated public purposes, or indeed Ofcom’s own definitions of the principles and practice of public service broadcasting, any single BBC programme failed. They could not name one because these are defined so broadly that even the most puerile quiz at some point has some information in it.
default&#xa0;defaultQ2 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default In your evidence you were fairly sceptical that the “
defaultWeakest Link
default”
default 
defaultdid meet the test but—
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: The
default 
default“
defaultWeakest Link
default” meets a different test, which is, what do we want public service broadcasting to mean and to do? It is a phrase that is thrown around a great deal. But if public service broadcasting embraces everything that the BBC does, and nearly everything 
defaultthat ITV and Channel 4 does, and quite a lot of things that Sky does, why are we bothering with the concept? It does not tell us anything. It does not tell us what to do. It does not tell us how to invest, what to invest: more, less, the same amount? For me the only real test of public service broadcasting—which is a different matter from the BBC—is, would it exist without public support and do we want it to exist? In other words, content that the marketplace would not deliver, either in sufficient quantity or at all, is what I regard as the basis for intervening in the broadcasting market.
default              
defaultWe have started from a different point and I respect it. The BBC is not just there to deliver what the market does not deliver. You cannot have a BBC that is defined by what Sky or ITV or Channel 4 chooses to do, so you are starting from a different proposition. For me a lot of what the BBC does is indistinguishable from what the marketplace does. Does that matter? For me it matters only to the extent that the BBC is financed in a particular way and for me the licence fee has many attractions. It is certainly efficient in some ways. It has certainly delivers what the BBC needs, and has done for 92 years, and its rough justice elements and unpleasantness for a small minority of the population—only 2 million people have been criminalised by the BBC in the last two decades; it is not that much, is it?—should not be a determining factor in saying, “We must have something different.”
default              
defaultWhat puzzles me about the BBC and its funding is this. The last time we had a committee of inquiry into financing the BBC was 28 years ago—the Peacock Committee. We have managed without a formal inquiry for nearly 30 years. I have brought a copy of the BBC’s evidence to that inquiry if anyone is interested. It basically says, “We recognise the rough justice of the licence fee. We are attracted by the notion of a subscription. If anyone could demonstrate how it would work we would be even more interested. We are determined to find out how to make a subscription system work—the technology, the implementation, the cost and so on.” Since then we have not had a single word from the BBC about anything they have done. We know it works because 60% of the population subscribe to channels other than the BBC. So we have a mechanism with 28 years of proof behind it but the BBC is still where it always was, “keep a-hold of nurse, for fear of something worse”.
default              
defaultWhat has struck me in recent years is that, funnily enough, it is not even just the BBC that is hanging on to the licence fee. It is Ministers, and Ministers now have a vested interest in keeping the licence fee going.
default&#xa0;defaultQ3 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default We are going to come on to funding issues in more detail shortly, but your view is that what the BBC is there to do is certainly influenced by the method by which it is funded.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: Absolutely. As long as it is funded by the licence fee it will do what it does and it does it rather well.
default&#xa0;defaultQ4 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Steve, in answering the question, I am conscious that you are an employee of the BBC as well. Obviously we are very interested to hear your views, but also, because you present a show, you are aware of the debate more generally, so would you give us an idea of how you perceive the different opinions that are emerging?
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: If I may say one thing before that about my background. You probably have it in front of you, but just so that you know. I work at the BBC. My first job was on “
defaultPanorama
default” way, way back and then I worked on “
defaultNationwide
default”. Then I was at Channel 4 when it first started, doing a programme called “The 
defaultFriday Alternative
default”, and then “
defaultDiverse 
defaultReports
default”, which gave me a particular perspective on things because that set out to do things that other broadcasters would not do at that time. In fact they used to get quite annoyed with it. I then worked at the BBC as editor of “
defaultPanorama
default”, at a reasonably senior level in news and current affairs in documentaries. At Channel 4 I was Head of Factual Programmes, and then at Carlton Television I was Director of Programmes, on the board and so on. So in terms of the way organisations work, that is one thing to point out.
defaultI should also make the observation that, when I went from the BBC to Channel 4 to ITV, you might have imagined I had gone from least commercial to most commercial. In fact when I left John Birt’s BBC, as editor of “
defaultPanorama
default”, I knew precisely how much money I had, precisely how much the people I was employing cost me and precisely how much the rooms I used cost me. I could bore you with all this because, of course, it all got slightly obsessive. Anyway, I knew precisely who watched “
defaultPanorama
default”, for how long and so on. I knew all of this. If I closed an office—and indeed I did; I got rid of a reporter, who has still not quite forgiven me, and I was free to hire two assistant producers and a researcher with the money—I had actual control. I could not do just what I wanted but I had control. When I went to Channel 4 I discovered that no one was very clear about what anything cost and the arrangements were much, much more obscure. It should have been more straightforward but it was not. When I went to ITV no one had the foggiest idea what anything cost because ITV in its DNA was a kind of licensed monopoly and, provided you did not lose the licence, the cash just rolled in.
default              
defaultSo my perspective on the BBC is a slightly odd one. In my direct experience of it, the BBC has led the industry to what now passes as common professional practice in terms of knowledge about audiences, commissioning, cost controls and so on. The BBC—and I think John Birt deserves credit for this—were in the front of that process. That is my perspective on it.
default              
defaultBroadly, I think the BBC’s output is in pretty fine form. As much as anyone else, you will have noticed that there appears to be no public demand that I can see for the BBC to do less. In principle, there may be an argument about how much the BBC does. Do not get me wrong; I am not suggesting that there is not a fair argument to have about how big it is and how much it does and all the rest of it, but identify any particular service and you just notice and see what happens. Radio 
default6 Music
default is a service that no one had even heard of, let alone listened to, before it was proposed for closure, and it is now a jewel in the crown, garnering millions of listeners. Incidentally, they are some of the best served licence payers in the country. The interesting thing about them is that, unlike local radio listeners in 
defaultLiverpool
default, who do not use any of the BBC radio services, you will find listeners of 
default6 Music
default listen to Radio 1, 2 and 4 and sometimes 3.
default              
defaultSo I think the output is in pretty good form. There are key challenges brewing in terms of the next phase of the digital future and what that means. Again, in the old world of TV, the BBC and commercial broadcasters were synergistic. When the BBC won the ratings battle, because ITV was a monopoly and advertisers had nowhere else to go, as ITV’s ratings went down ITV’s cost per thousand went up. In other words, the advertisers had paid their £100 for 100 viewers but if ITV only delivered 80—because the BBC was doing rather well with “
defaultMorecambe and Wise
default”
default—
defaultthey did not get their money back. There was nowhere else to go and they could not go anywhere else to advertise on television, so next time round, in the next negotiation, ITV’s price per thousand would go up. So it was not just synergistic, being beaten in the ratings periodically by the BBC did ITV a proper commercial service. Their revenues went up, which is one of the odd things that happened in that closed system but essentially it was at least synergistic.
default              
defaultIn the multi-channel world there is a more direct connection between audiences and revenues. Even then it is quite diffuse because revenues are complicated by subscription, which is the bulk of revenues in that marketplace. Therefore, revenues do not relate directly to audience 
defaultnumbers. As you will see, Sky is a hugely powerful and very well run commercial company that makes vast amounts of money on relatively low amounts of viewing, because people are paying a lot more for something they particularly want so the business model is different.
default              
defaultIn the online world it is more complicated because there eyeballs equals money. If the BBC is taking eyeballs and as a result 
defaultThe 
defaultTimes
default is not getting eyeballs, then plainly, on the face of it, there must be an issue of some sort. In this new world I think the market impact issues faced by the BBC are of a different order and do need proper thinking through. I am not saying the BBC should not be there; I think if the BBC was not there we would probably all be the poorer for it. But defining what public service broadcasting means—and the BBC’s underlying purposes—in this converged space, and thinking through what the market impact implications of that are, I think are pretty serious. I will be brief. So, output, challenges ahead for sure, and maintaining quality in the face of the DQF—delivering quality first—and the last licence fee settlement, is really, really tough. As anyone who has been in business for any time will tell you, doing the same for 20% less is not easy. I am sure we will come on to discuss this, but I am not sure that the arguments about what the BBC should do about it have been appropriately framed. It tends to be either salami slicing or cutting services. It may be that there is another option here, what you might call radical efficiency, but we could talk about that.
default              
defaultOrganisationally it has the appearance of a basket case. It appears to be an organisation that is succeeding creatively in spite of itself. Appearances in front of your Committee, and appearances in front of the Public Accounts Committee and elsewhere, in one sense have left the BBC reeling. The only upside is that the current leader of the BBC, the person who is really pulling the strings, Tony Hall, was not involved in any of this and appears to have made a reasonably good fist of his first 
defaultx
default months in the job. At least it appears to be reasonably stable. But there are big questions about organisation and governance, culture, internal competition and internal plurality. The balance between efficiency and plurality is quite hard to match and quite a lot of issues about the BBC’s lack of internal plurality can be tied to approaches to efficiency.
default              
defaultI also say that the BBC plays a very important part in the competitive ecology of our broadcasting world. I think it is axiomatic without “
defaultStrictly Come Dancing
default”,  “The 
defaultX Factor
default” would probably never have been as good as it was. By contrast, without “The 
defaultX Factor
default”, “
defaultThe Voice
default” would have remained the basket case it began life as, but actually it managed to reinvent itself. I only say this because—to take the point of: what is public service broadcasting?—beware of what you wish for. If one seeks to define it too tightly, you end up destroying the competitive ecology that viewers and listeners benefit from. Sometimes things pop out which then play back, and then obviously it is axiomatic that it is public service broadcasting once you have seen it. If you had done it the other way round and said, “Should you really do that as a public service broadcaster?” you might well have said, “No.” I am not saying there should be no limits and there should be no sense of what it is, but I would be very careful about where those lines are drawn. So I think the output is fine, but the organisation needs to be properly looked at.
defaultChair:default Thank you very much for your overviews.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ5 default&#xa0; 
defaultJim Sheridan:default A very brief question. One of the main criticisms of public sector broadcasting or the BBC is its alleged political bias. Given your extensive experience and knowledge of the BBC, is that a fair criticism?
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: Personally, I think generally speaking, no it is not. The BBC goes out of its way to be fair and balanced, much to the frustration and annoyance of people on all sides. However, I would say that there are some issues—immigration is one and 
defaultEurope
default has perhaps been another. The BBC have more or less acknowledged that, for a whole variety of reasons, and not just reasons that apply to the BBC, because of the association of 
defaultimmigration control with racism—it is a generational thing as much as anything else—there was plainly a reluctance to deal with some questions about immigration. I think that is probably fair.
defaultWas that a top-down corporate bias? I am not sure that it was. I am not sure that anyone ever said, “We must not deal with this,” but there was a reluctance to deal with it. Nick Robinson, the BBC’s Political Editor, who is much more eminent than I, made a programme that aired on the BBC just last week that said pretty well that. Are there on occasion some broader biases? Truthfully, probably there are. Is there a day-to-day attempt in any sense to exclude points of view to be anything other than fair? In my experience, no, there is not.
defaultClaire Endersdefault: I do not have anything to add to that. That has been my experience.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: I would be a little more expansive than Steve on this. It is an institutional problem. You can go back to Reith and Churchill in the 1930s. When I started at the BBC you couldn’t cover 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default in current affairs programmes; you just couldn’t. The leading producer on “
defaultPanorama
default”, a former colleague of yours, Phillip Whitehead, left the BBC to join ITV. One of the first programmes he commissioned was “
defaultThis Week
default”
default 
defaulton 
defaultg
defaulterrymandering in 
defaultDerry
default. It was unthinkable that that could have been broadcast by the BBC in those days. The control of 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default would have blocked it.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ6 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair: defaultYou pointed out in your evidence that you made “Death on the Rock”. Could that have been made by the BBC?
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: “
defaultDeath on the Rock
default” would not have been made by the BBC. At times, in recent decades, John Ware and Peter Taylor have done excellent programmes about 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default, so that taboo has gone, but for a period it was completely out of the question.
defaultSteve mentions immigration; for probably 20 or 30 years the BBC have just been too nervous to deal with the subject directly. From my own personal experience of the last few years, I know that there are some subjects the BBC just does not want to report on and it would rather err on the side of omission than take a risk. The Savile thing was a small example of that. It was only because ITV eventually made the programme that the BBC’s embarrassment was exposed to public view; otherwise, none of us would have ever heard of that “
defaultNewsnight
default” investigation and what it involved.
default              
defaultThere is a cultural institutional reluctance to handle certain issues and 
defaultEurope
default has been another, but I do not believe there is any bias to be found among reporters. It is a structural not an individual thing. I do think BBC journalists, for the most part, are extremely straight and the BBC as an organisation is right up there. I would not say that any other news organisation has a better reputation than BBC News.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ7 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Farrelly:default David, I think it came as a bit of a surprise at New Year, before Robert Peston’s mea culpa, for many of us to be listening to the BBC news programmes about Bulgarians and Romanians and thinking, “Has the BBC been taken over by the 
defaultDaily Mail
default?” I was not going to make the mistake of the 
defaultMail
default in criticising the BBC. Let us see how it pans out. This is a chapter from your forthcoming book, is it?
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: It is a chapter from a forthcoming book. I only wrote one chapter.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ8 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Farrelly:default I want to raise this now because in this polemical chapter you seem to go a step further, and I wonder whether you really mean this. You link the BBC’s fortunes to immigrants paying the licence fee and, therefore, giving it some income. Then you say at one point, “Although the BBC might feel nervous about being one of the few public bodies with a vested interest in mass immigration—” Are you seriously suggesting that the BBC corporately is feeling nervous about its vested interest in mass immigration?
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: I happen to know it is, but it is not a happy place to be when you are one of the very few public organisations that directly benefits from unlimited expansion of the population in terms of the number of households. There is nothing you can do about it; it is not your decision that there should be open doors or whatever it might be. It was not the BBC’s decision that single-person households should expand by huge amounts in the 1990s and 2000s, but the actual impact was a 50% rise in the number of households paying the licence fee.
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: Sorry, can I just say that I spend a lot of time sneaking around the corridors and seeing what is going on, and I have never heard anybody ever, anywhere, off the record, on the record, in any form at all, express any view that mass immigration might be a good thing for the BBC because it would increase the licence fee take. I think that is preposterous. I have seen no evidence for it anywhere. Do not get me wrong, I am absolutely certain the BBC will take any money that is coming, but the idea that the BBC’s editorial approach to immigration is in some way affected by a corporate view that it would benefit from increased immigration is rubbish.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: Steve, that is absolutely not what I said. Paul has just carefully read out my tongue-in-cheek remark on the grounds that—
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: Just to clarify just in case.
defaultPaul Farrelly:default This was the question I was asking you. Do you seriously think it or is it tongue in cheek and you have—
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: It just happens to be a fact of life, as a side product of a certain social phenomenon. I am not suggesting—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ9 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default You are not suggesting what Steve is saying he had never heard?
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: Look, if the BBC were funded by subscription I couldn’t possibly object to any number of Romanian, Bulgarian or other immigrants taking out a BBC subscription. Why should 1?
defaultSteve Hewlett:default But you could certainly object to the BBC taking an attitude towards immigration that was based on that.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: Of course I would.
defaultSteve Hewlett: defaultIndeed, just to be clear.
defaultPaul Farrelly:default I think we have now established that that is tongue in cheek and is not a pitch for a forthcoming serialisation in the 
defaultDaily Mail
default.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: I am glad you found it. It was tucked away at the end. Did you also pick up the one about the over-75s speed testing?
defaultPaul Farrelly:default There is more I want to come to later on.
defaultChair: defaultLet us
default get 
defaultback to the mainstream debate.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ10 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default We are talking about whether or not there are subjects that the BBC might shy away from, for whatever reason. I wonder whether I could get a comment from you on the other issue, which I think the BBC has had a very set view on in recent years, which is climate change. We have all now read about the semi-secret gathering a few years ago, which Roger Harrabin was responsible for, when the BBC decided that there was a set science now, that there was no room for any further denial that there might be manmade climate change and that they agreed that this was going to influence the way they covered the issues. Does that—
defaultChair:default Can we please do this briefly, since we are straying an awful long way from the subject, the future of the BBC?
defaultAngie Bray:default But that is another issue, which I think needs to be addressed in terms of how they—
defaultChair:default Okay.
defaultAngie Bray:default This may be because there is a mindset there, which kicks—
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: In the case of climate change, I am not sure that there is. Just a couple of points on this. I have not read in detail the BBC’s reasons for opposing the freedom of information request, which has ultimately exposed the existence of this briefing. I am guessing—and if you know better, please do not let me put my foot in it—they would say, “This is an editorial matter and therefore, quite properly and quite rightly, outside the scope of FOI”. Is it wrong for BBC journalists and editorial executives to acquaint themselves, as fully as they can, with views from all sides of the argument about these things, and possibly do that in private and in circumstances that are not widely reported? My own personal view is I would rather they were better informed than less informed, and so probably, yes.
default              
defaultI am not sure how strong the case is to say that the BBC is overwhelmingly one way or the other on climate change. I think it is a difficult issue because the balance of scientific argument and evidence must be taken account of. Balance can never simply mean on one hand or the other; otherwise we would still be arguing about the world being flat. It has to take some account of where the debate has gone and what the balance of opinion is. I am not sure that I see the fact that this meeting took place and that executives went to it and discussed it, as evidence of a broader conspiracy to report in a particular way.
defaultAngie Bray:default I think you just need to look at the list of the people that were there.
defaultChair:default Let us get back to the future of the BBC.
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: In fairness that will not be the only thing they have done, will it?
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: Who knows.
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: Well, I would be surprised.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ11 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Leech:default Mr Elstein, I do not want to put words in your mouth but I think you started off by saying that you did support the BBC or you were not an opponent of the BBC.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: I am strongly supportive of the BBC.
default&#xa0;defaultQ12 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Leech:default As with all people who seem to be very critical of the BBC, they start off by saying, “I am a big supporter of the BBC but—” and then give a whole host of reasons as to why they are not really a supporter of the BBC. Would that be a fair reflection?
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: No. I only have one but, which is the way it is financed, and that is not entirely the BBC’s fault.
default&#xa0;defaultQ13 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Leech:default You then went on to say that the BBC was responsible for criminalising 2 million people.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: That is a fact of life.
default&#xa0;defaultQ14 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Leech:default 
defaultW
defaultould you say, then, that Sky TV is responsible for criminalising anyone who has watched a football match in a pub at 3 o’clock on a Saturday afternoon?
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: No, because it is the Premier League who are prosecuting those cases anyway because they are the owners of the copyright.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ15 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Leech:default What is the difference?
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: The BBC is charged with implementing the licence fee. It uses an agency, but TV Licensing is owned by the BBC and the BBC prosecutes 150,000 to 160,000 people every year. They are automatically convicted because there is no defence against the charge and, therefore, you have 150,000 criminals a year who are only being prosecuted because they failed to pay the TV licence fee and the BBC chose to prosecute them.
default              
defaultI do not see there is much alternative as long as it is a criminal offence not to pay the TV licence fee; someone has got to do the prosecution.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ16 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Leech:default Is not the Government responsible for criminalising them?
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: Of course the Government is the source of it, but Parliament—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ17 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Leech:default So why blame the BBC?
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: Because the BBC is complicit in it. The BBC could very easily say, “We do not want it to be a criminal offence, only a civil offence,” they can very easily say that, “and we will take non-payers to court,” the way BT does or electricity companies do or gas companies do or anybody else or, indeed, Sky Television might do, except Sky Television just cut you off.
defaultThe BBC is absolutely complicit in maintaining failure to pay the licence fee as a criminal offence. Why should they want to hide from that? My personal view is, every single senior member of the BBC management, every member of the BBC Trust, should go to their local magistrates court on a Monday morning until they have seen the convictions of enough 
defaultevaders of the licence fee—people too poor or disorganised to pay it, and they are usually repeat offenders—until their salary has been paid by those people. It might take several Mondays for some executives; it might take a year of Mondays for the Chief Executive, but I do think you need to know where your money is coming from and why and how.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ18 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Leech:default Did you want to add to that?
defaultClaire Endersdefault: I think that this issue goes to the heart of one of your areas of inquiry, which is what the BBC is for. The simple point advanced by David and me, which is different, is that in his submission or indeed in the chapter of the book, the words “public service broadcasting” do not feature. At no stage is the BBC alluded to or imparted as a public service, and that is a philosophical difference between David and me. I am very enthusiastic about the concept and believe it to be a great institution. Indeed, there is also a philosophical difference between me, David and ITV, which believe that the BBC is a venture capital fund for the creative industry. I am just saying that these are very clear-cut conceptual differences between people here, but I would say that the majority of the population is with me in terms of a great deal of support for public service broadcasting, howsoever construed, because of course ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and indeed the BBC does account for 75% of viewing.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ19 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Leech:default I am going to come on to that in a second, but I would like to return to Mr Elstein. Mr Farrelly raised the point in your book about the BBC supporting immigration—
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: No.
defaultMr Leech:default Indirectly supporting immigration because they benefit from—
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: Having a vested interest.
defaultMr Leech:default Having a vested interest, okay.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: They can’t help themselves.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ20 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Leech: defaultWould that not be the case with all other broadcasters who charge their customers on an individual subscription basis, because the bigger the population in the UK the more potential customers, Sky TV or Virgin Media or whoever else, BT Sport, they would all benefit from it as well?
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: If any of those people voluntarily subscribe, of course, but nobody can subscribe to Virgin Media or Sky without paying the licence fee first. That you have no choice about. If you want to watch television you have to pay the licence fee. What you do after that is a matter of individual choice and that is the point I made to Mr Farrelly.
default&#xa0;defaultQ21 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Leech:default My point is that all other broadcasters stand to benefit. The bigger the population, the more they stand to benefit because the more potential customers they all have.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: You could say that about every single retail organisation in the country, Tesco as well.
defaultChair:default I think this is an argument that is not taking us very far. I think we both know what you mean.
default&#xa0;defaultQ22 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Leech:default The reason for my argument is that you started off with quite a lengthy contribution, starting off by saying that you were a big supporter of the BBC but then gave numerous reasons as to why you did not really like the BBC at all.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: Honestly, Mr Leech, you can’t have been listening to me very carefully. I am a strong supporter of the BBC. I wish it were a bigger, better, bolder, braver, richer organisation than it is, funded voluntarily by citizens of the 
defaultUK
default and elsewhere. That’s all I have to say about the BBC.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ23 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Leech:default Setting aside the way it is funded then, in your opinion what should the BBC be providing?
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: Exactly what it does and more. I think it should provide premium sport, premium arts and premium documentaries. It should compete across the board, provided it is funded in a voluntary fashion. Why shouldn’t it? It is a brilliant broadcasting organisation. It should have huge confidence in its ability to survive on a voluntary basis. As I happen to know for a fact, because it has been public, several previous Director-Generals of the BBC agree that the BBC would flourish under a voluntary subscription system. Therefore, the issue I have with the licence fee is not—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ24 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Leech:default Where is your evidence that it would flourish under a voluntary contribution system?
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: How does anyone know? It is a matter of opinion.
defaultChair:default We are meant to be covering funding later. Can we stick to our plan?
default&#xa0;defaultQ25 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Leech:default I am sorry, Chair, I am just trying to get to the nub of what Mr Elstein thinks the BBC should provide. He seems to be saying that the BBC should be providing exactly what it does at the moment but it should not get any cash to do so.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: What a strange way to describe what I have said. It should not be given cash or allowed to extract cash from people on the basis of, “You will be criminally prosecuted if you don’t.” It should have the courage of its convictions. If the BBC believes it is such brilliant value for money—and it is pretty good value for money—it should have not the slightest problem in persuading people to pay for it voluntarily and there is abundant research evidence that at least 80% of the population, if not 90%, would voluntarily pay the current licence fee level of the BBC. There is substantial evidence that 40% of the population would pay double the licence fee to keep the BBC, and 20% would pay treble the licence fee. So there is no question but that the BBC could survive in a subscription environment. It is just a matter of choice and the choice is not just the BBC’s, it is Ministers who have that choice. Unfortunately, Ministers themselves now have a vested interest in keeping the licence fee because so much Government expenditure is now paid for out of the licence fee. That is a very unfortunate state of affairs.
defaultBut I am strongly supportive of the BBC as an organisation. The licence fee is an historical anachronism, which eventually will fade away. While it is there it is there, and good luck to the BBC in using it. It is not the BBC’s choice.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ26 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Leech:default Can I ask Mr Hewlett and Ms Enders whether they think there are things that the BBC is providing at the moment that they should not be providing?
defaultClaire Endersdefault: No, I really don’t. I think that the amplitude of the BBC’s products match media consumption and also match the devices upon which people are viewing, which is an incredibly important support in order to maximise consumption. So no. But if the Chairman is correct that we are going to return to these arguments about subscription I would be most grateful because—
defaultChair:default We are going to return. What I want to concentrate on at the moment—which John has now reached—is the question of what the BBC does. How it is paid for is a separate debate, which we will be coming on to.
defaultClaire Endersdefault: Good.
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: I am not sure. It is matters above my pay grade, really. Broadly—
default&#xa0;defaultQ27 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Leech:default Can I give you an example? “
defaultThe Voice
default” was mentioned before and some people have been quite critical of the BBC for producing a programme that appeared, just simply, to try to steal some of the market from “
defaultThe X Factor
default”.
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: When you talk about stealing the market, there has been a competitive ecology in British broadcasting ever since there were two. Now there is the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and 5, and of course Sky now playing an increasingly significant part in it. The BBC plays a central part in that. It plays a central part in that precisely because it makes programmes in all genres. By and large I think the British public are better served because there is full-on competition between ITV and the BBC, even in areas that might be regarded as commercial in one sense. So I think that the British public benefits because all these programmes improve because they are all at it.
defaultOn occasions it does produce some rather bizarre twists. When, say, this programme is up against that programme; when the competitive instincts of schedulers and commissioners on all sides overtake each other; when Simon Cowell goes to the public press to attack the BBC for daring to make a programme that might be better than his; or whatever. So I am not saying it cannot overbalance but, generally speaking, the public have benefited from the fact that there is significant competition around all genres, not just strictly public service ones but more broadly into the world of entertainment as well. So I do not look at the BBC and think, “There are all these things that they should not be doing.” I do not feel that. I do not think the public feels that either.
defaultThere is another question about whether they do too much. That may be a more challenging question: is it too much? For example—and other people have said this and we may be slightly past this argument now—when the BBC started BBC Three and BBC Four, remember, with the Government of the day’s full support, that was part of the licence fee settlement way back about driving digital Britain; about bringing the British public to multi-challenge television. It was about developing a platform, which eventually turned into 
defaultFreeview. That was not commercial, not Sky and not subscription-based. That is now an important part of the mixture of broadcasting available to consumers in the 
defaultUK
default. When they did that, though, several things happened. First of all, they nearly killed BBC Two because BBC Three took on comedy and BBC Four took on culture, arts and long-form documentary, which left BBC Two wondering what it was. So this was not an easy process.
defaultOf course, when you look at it, the vast majority of the costs of BBC Three and BBC Four are in the content that they commission. It is not in the running of the channels. There are some costs but not that many. So what happened, of course, was that the number of hours to be filled expanded 
defaultand
default the BBC expanded its spend and its output and its creation of content to fill it. Even the Director of Television at the time described some of the stuff on BBC Three and BBC Four as—I think this is right—“stuff”, meaning it was there to fill the space. In my opinion, because of cost pressures, because of licence fee settlements and all the rest of it, what has happened since is that they are now both much more focused. There is a danger of tilting at windmills at BBC Three and BBC Four now because I am not sure that there would be widespread support for the BBC not doing what they do. There is a question about whether that is the best way of delivering it.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ28 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Could you not do all that they do but do it on two channels?
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: You certainly could. But the question is, what do you lose in terms of range and quality? Remember: TV is a creative business. If working out which one was going to be the hit was that easy I would certainly be very rich indeed, and I am not. When I was at Channel 4 I turned down a sous chef at the River Café who was offered to me. They said, “He is a really good guy; really good”. I went down and saw him and thought, “I don’t know; I am not sure,” and we turned it down. That was Jamie Oliver.
defaultSo anyway, don’t look to me for this. All I will say is that it is an uncertain business. It is a percentage game and you have to keep on trying. So again, I do not know whether the quantum is right but do you want the BBC to do substantially less? The risk you run in terms of quantum if you do, is that you do not get the hits. For me there is an argument that says, “In the current circumstances, in current market conditions, does the BBC do too much of things? Maybe it does; discuss.” Does the BBC do things generally speaking that it shouldn’t do? I think that is a much harder argument to make.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ29 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Leech:default I will come back to you in a second.
defaultSome have argued that now the likes of Sky and ITV are creating great content, whether it be “
defaultGame of Thrones
default”, 
defaultDownton
default or whatever it might be, the BBC does not need to be producing all that original content. But a recent report has argued that it is the existence of great content from public-sector broadcasting from the BBC that is pushing the others.
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: You can easily argue it is both ways. The point is that it is an ecology.
default&#xa0;defaultQ30 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Leech:default The question I am asking is this. Do you accept that the BBC is driving up quality in the commercial sector or not?
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: I think it is also important to accept that because it is an ecology, a system—not entirely closed but still a system—ITV and Channel 4, and on occasions, Sky, also drive quality at the BBC. Without the BBC, would the system be the poorer? In my opinion, 
defaultsubstantially, yes, it would. You only have to look at things that we have seen this week. “
defaultSherlock
default”
default,
default “
defaultStrictly Come Dancing
default”—you name it. Of course the BBC drives quality but so does everybody else and the BBC reacts to quality elsewhere just as others react to quality at the BBC.
defaultClaire Endersdefault: I would add to that. 
defaultAbsolute
defaultly. That is also true in the online world, which is largely driven by words, and also true in radio where the extraordinarily high standards to which the BBC Radio services hold themselves are very sustaining of the culture and dynamism of a very large range of sectors, particularly the music sector. But I would say that 
defaultabsolute
defaultly—according to the evidence that we have provided about the 
defaultUK
default as a creative economy—that the BBC can take longer-term and bigger risks.
default“
defaultGame of Thrones
default” was not entirely British in terms of the actors, costume-making or many of the locations and so on. I am led to believe the scriptwriting is almost entirely British but it was financed by an American force, HBO. It is a very high standard, $10 million an hour, and, as I said in my evidence, it is a standard to which only a handful of British players can reach. But we have more British players in that game of global programming—the 
defaultDownton
default, “
defaultGame of Thrones
default”, “
defaultSherlock
default” end of things—which is a great part of the business to be in. I echo 
defaultabsolute
defaultly that the competition for quality has this extraordinary effect on the British media for all forms of creation. I do not know if you have managed to see “
defaultSherlock
default” but the standards of production brought to bear are very high indeed and that works because the BBC can draw on financing from around the world to make it happen.
defaultI would say very strongly that the BBC is so important—to independent production, accounting for, I believe, a third of all commissions: the biggest single customer and so on—that you can never take the BBC out of our creative economy without causing some form of ritualistic implosion. I really do believe in a 500-channel environment; for the BBC to have four channels that make people like me, who are very BBC Four people, feel very comfortable, rather than having to watch “
defaultStrictly Come Dancing
default”
default.
default I think that is the right tissue; that is the right range. Other public service broadcasters, including Channel 4, have a similar range of services. I just do not think that there is anything broken about the current range. I just do not see it.
default&#xa0;defaultQ31 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Leech:default Do you have a view on that, Mr Elstein?
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: It is a slightly skewed argument. Incidentally, “
defaultGame of Thrones
default” was turned down by the BBC. It was originally a BBC development. At least as many of the actors in “
defaultGame of Thrones
default” are Irish as are British. That is a wonderful talent that HBO has dipped into.
default              
defaultI think there is a misconception here: the difference between content and output. In broadcasting you try to package your output in distinctive ways. There are people who will watch E4 who will not watch Channel 4. There are people who will watch ITV3 because it is targeted at them—it is repeats of ITV police dramas—who do not particularly watch ITV because it has too much soap in it. So if you look at the BBC portfolio of broadcast channels—the entertainment channels, One, Two, Three and Four—Two, Three and Four have very little original content in them. Just over 10% of the broadcast hours is original produced programming, excluding repeats and live. On BBC Four and Three, because they are only from 7pm to 4am, the level of repeats is very high. BBC Two is now all repeats during daytime rather than live.
defaultIt is a bit of an optical illusion to say we have four channels. We have four packages, one of which is pretty full; one of which is fairly full; two of which are pretty empty. But they fulfil a purpose because they broaden the range of offerings as perceived by the public. The public does not necessarily look at “the BBC”. They look at BBC One or BBC Two or BBC Three or BBC Four, or indeed even BBC Parliament. That is the way viewers function. They tend to have nine or 10 channels on their favourites list. It might include Sky 1. It might include Sky Arts. But that does not mean they are not people who also watch BBC channels. The BBC is planning to put out a Plus 1 channel, which I notice ITV has criticised in its written evidence to you. It is exactly the same channel an hour later. That is just another way of saying, “If you have missed it or were watching something else at 9pm you can now watch what you were going to watch.” I do not see anything wrong with that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ32 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Leech:default Just to be clear, my final question—that was a bit of a politician’s answer, and I am not sure that I got an answer to my question—do you believe that BBC content drives up quality in the commercial sector? Yes or no?
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: There is plenty of evidence to suggest it does. In 
default“Public Service Broadcasting: Annual Report 2009”
default—I refer you to table 4.3, if you are interested—Ofcom published a report by McKinsey that looked more broadly at the issue. It looked at the macro rather than the micro level of what was happening in individual economies as between public sector and private sector.
defaultIn the 13 economies they looked at, what they established was that the higher the investment in the public sector, the lower the investment in the private sector. It is a very interesting read. It does not invalidate the point that Claire and Steve were making, which is that our broadcasters compete with each other. It does not prove that crowding out necessarily occurs, though if you have Luke Johnson, the former chairman of Channel 4, as a witness he will tell you that it did. But there is compelling evidence that the most successful broadcasting economy in the world, which 
defaultobviously
default is the 
defaultUS
default media economy, is overwhelmingly driven by private finance, not public finance; and by consumer choice, not by compulsory levies.
defaultMr Leech:default Am I right to believe that the answer is no?
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: No. It is yes. But it is not the only answer. There are two ways of looking at it: micro and macro.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ33 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default I shall be brief because I know that colleagues want to get on to the much more meaty issues of funding and governance. But just to carry on with the issues around production and content, Steve, I was very interested in your comments about the output and the argument over whether the BBC does too much.
defaultYou mentioned television. I wonder about your views on radio. 
defaultObviously
default there has been a lot of criticism that Radio 1 and Radio 2, for example, have become too mainstream and that is in effect impacting on the commercial market. Do you have any comments on radio and whether or not that is perhaps an area where the BBC could look into whether it is doing too much?
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: When I said too much in terms of TV, I really meant volume—the sheer number of hours of all of this—and is there a version of the BBC that does perhaps less hours of all of that? The potential downside is that it is a percentage game and if you reduce the overall quantum you run the risk that you reduce a number of things.
default              
defaultThe commercial dynamics of radio are reasonably straightforward. There is a commercial sweet spot, which is 20-something—late 20s through to late 40s. That is the commercial hotspot and that is where most of the playlists, most of the music choices and a lot of the branding of commercial stations everywhere focus. So when Radio 1 gets too old, or Radio 2 gets too young, you can see that there is real pressure because in radio there is a more direct connection between listeners and revenues. In particular, local radio advertising is often characterised as: you advertise on Friday and if you have not sold out by Sunday, you do not come back.
default              
defaultIn the world of TV and some radio network advertising, it is a much more sophisticated business. Claire knows more about this than I do. Essentially the problem for BBC Radio, as far as commercial broadcasting is concerned, is when they encroach on the sweet spot. Generally speaking, that is Radio 1 getting too old or Radio 2 getting too young. Radio 1’s problems—and this is the Chris Moyles’ issue—are in part because people tend to grow old with stations. That is what people do. No one really worries about doing Radio 4. Once you get the Radio 4 habit you are quite likely to keep it for quite a long time. Once you get the Nick Ferrari habit on LBC, you stick with it. You might pick it up at age 30. You are probably still listening to him when you are 50.
default              
defaultThe dynamics of this are a bit more complicated. The problem Radio 1 has is that every now and again it has to go through a convulsion to reduce the average age of its listeners because if you just leave it doing everything it does—same playlists, same DJs—by definition it will get older. Some new people come in but people who like it stick with it. It is in a constant state of flux. I am not sure that it necessarily amounts to an argument to say that the BBC should not do Radio 2 or Radio
default 
default1, but they do need to be very careful about the market impact they induce.
default              
defaultThe Radio 4 question is altogether more interesting in a number of ways. Regarded as the jewel in the crown—especially Wednesday afternoons about 4.30, sorry—anyway as the jewel in the crown, of course, it is the one BBC service that has no competitor at all, which is an odd one. So Radio 4—
default&#xa0;defaultQ34 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default It is beginning to. Looking at Radio 4 on Wednesday afternoon at 4.30, which of course I am religiously glued to—
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: You will be there tomorrow.
defaultChair:default —but I also listen to the 
defaultGuardian
default m
defaultedia
default podcast, which is pretty much competition, is it not?
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: It is. That is true. For individual programmes there may be things. But generally speaking there is no other service like Radio 4. It is not like BBC One. You have ITV; you have Sky 1; you have Sky Atlantic; you have Channel 4. It is not like the TV environment. It is not even like commercial radio where you have Radio 1, Radio 2 and all the commercials. There is no competitor to Radio 4. It is quite interesting that one of the most profound periods of change in Radio 4’s proposition occurred when they began to wake up to the possibility that Channel 4 might start a competitor. That is where “The 
defaultMedia Show
default” came from. I think the boffins at Radio 4 thought, “Hang on a minute. If we don’t do this, someone else will.” Would it ever have happened without the potential competitor in the wings? That did not happen, so Radio 4 is an odd one. Again, I do not sense any public demand for Radio 4 to do less—for there to be less Radio 4. So I am not sure that the volume question applies in that regard.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ35 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default Do you think the BBC has too much ownership of the market in terms of radio? If you think about your dial, for example, from 88 to 96 it is all BBC, so there is little competition.
defaultClaire Endersdefault: There is a lot of competition for consumption of music. The core issue in the demographic has been that 25-year-olds have moved to Spotify and other forms of consumption. That has hurt both the commercial radio sector and the BBC in terms of depopulation, as indeed has the fact that the median age of the 
defaultUK
default is almost 40. The fact is that we do have an ageing demographic and there is a struggle for a relatively fixed but slowly declining group of people that numbers something like 60 million. So it is the bulk of the population.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ36 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default I did not want to get dragged into a wider debate about BBC radio. I was just interested in Stephen’s comments earlier about whether or not the BBC does too much and whether or not there was scope for perhaps reduction in the scale of its production of radio.
default              
defaultWhat I do want to ask about is this. PACT made it very clear that they think the key charter review issue is around the balance between how much BBC News creates production in-house and how much of it is external. I wonder what your views are on that. What balance should be struck?
defaultClaire Endersdefault: I made a point about this in my submission. I would like to point you to the fact that there are scale effects in production and that the UK has four scale players in Sky, ITV, the BBC and Channel 4, and therefore there needs to be scale for the BBC and there needs to be the scale to take long-term risks. Whether that is 50%—as indeed is the current state under WoCC, Window of Creative Competition—or it is 52% or 48%, is not a meaningful issue. I think it is an interesting debate. Certainly to my mind the thing that you must all keep in mind is that the public owns the rights to those programmes, whereas programmes that migrate out of the BBC to the independent production sector—which depends for its growth in part upon that migration—are programmes that are owned by other parties. They are paid for by us, the stakeholders, but we do not own them 100% and we may not own any part of them.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ37 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default Why is that important?
defaultClaire Endersdefault: Because the ability for the BBC to continue to have income is also related to its ability to exploit commercially programmes that genuinely fund future productions. In part BBC Worldwide largely sustains origination on the BBC through selling those programmes abroad. As we know, ITV did not have the rights to 
defaultDownton
default for a couple of years and then clawed them back. That was a real difficulty for ITV.
defaultAgain, that is a philosophical issue. If you believe that the BBC is a public service, which I do believe, in that case if it takes a creative bet, then we should get the benefit of that. I do think we get benefit from creative bets that are funded through the independent sector, through Channel 4, and indeed through the BBC itself, which is the biggest commissioner.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ38 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Are you saying we should change the terms of trade?
defaultClaire Endersdefault: No; I am saying precisely the opposite. I am saying that the existing system is one that I believe the BBC Trust reviewed and thought operated all right. It is normal for PACT to want to have the entirety of the BBC’s budget allocated to independent 
defaultproductions. That is the goal of that organisation. That is completely normal. I would be arguing the same if I were them. Indeed, David also argues the same, that the BBC should be a broadcaster without a production entity at all or it should be separated or radicalised in some other way. PACT also argues this.
defaultAll I am saying is that we—the public, the stakeholders, the people in this room—do not own 100% of what the BBC produces. We do own the BBC at some fundamental level. I do not own Shine. That company is owned by 21
defaultst 
defaultCentury Fox and, indeed, there are other production companies that are owned by other entities. Again, this is a core philosophical issue but to my mind what is most important is to sustain the BBC’s role in our creative economy and that role is based on origination or very high-profile, very wonderful public service broadcasting: whether you call it the Olympics or “
defaultSherlock
default” or David Attenborough or whatever, or the Jubilee or the wedding, these are the huge events. You need scale to deliver that.
defaultAgain, to David’s debate about public service broadcasting, public service broadcasting has hitherto for the last 90 years encompassed genres that the BBC tackles in a way with funding from us all. That is the core issue in relation to WoCC. To my mind the BBC has gone a very long way towards becoming a broadcaster with much more contestability since 2005. I think that there have been a lot of very good results from independently made productions on the BBC. I think that is something to be debated but I would urge you to be cautious about going for an arbitrary new solution, which diminishes the BBC’s ability to utilise also the vast amount of real estate, and which Government decisions have forced upon us all.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ39 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default So you think the 25% figure is enough: you do not think that should change.
defaultClaire Endersdefault: It is more than 25% because there is both the quota and WoCC. So I think that mechanism is the right one at the current level. Again, the exact level is for debate. But the BBC seems to be getting to the right level in terms of giving enough 
defaultopportunities
default to external producers and indeed to its own talent, because its own talent flies through the door as soon as they are successful and they form their own businesses anyway. So I think that is the right thing. I should just tell you, though, that I do deeply believe in scale. I understand why the 
defaultUK
default has been able to deliver four scale players. We did explain that in a chart, which you can see at the back of my submission, which shows the scale and the oligopoly point.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ40 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default Basically, you think that if the BBC were smaller it would not be able to create high quality programmes?
defaultClaire Endersdefault: It is not only about being smaller. Setting aside the income point, if the BBC were smaller, as an organisation that makes original material it would have scale problems. Yes. I think that is a risk.
default&#xa0;defaultQ41 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default Steve, you want to come in.
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: I would only make a couple of observations on this point. I think this is a vitally significant question. 
default              
defaultLet me declare another interest. Because the BBC pays bugger-all to people like me, I have to have other businesses to keep the wolf from the door and I run a 
defaultsmall independent production company. So do take that as a declaration of a potential conflict of interest.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ42 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default Is “T
defaulthe Media Show
default”
default 
defaultproduced 
defaultin-house?
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: That is in-house. But there are other things. I made a documentary about Rupert Murdoch last year; and a series about prisoners—people going in and out of prison—was made by Genie Pictures, a production company that I have a stake in.
default              
defaultBut the point I would make is this. If the BBC said you have a 50% in-house quota 25% indie and 25% WoCC, 80%-plus of the WoCC is going to independent producers. It is 
defaultabsolute
defaultly clear to me that, given a free hand—I am not saying they will take all of it from independent producers; probably far from it—BBC commissioners and channel executives would take more from the independent sector than they currently can. I do not think there is any doubt about that.
default              
defaultSecond, I think it is pretty clear that when you take full account of all the costs involved—sitting in a very expensive high-stake building right in the middle of central London and all the rest of it—in-house production is almost certainly more expensive than the independent counterpart.
default              
defaultIt is difficult to put an estimate on the scale of that but I look at this as a fundamental question. Go back to John Birt and producer choice. When he was under pressure from Mrs Thatcher and others to demonstrate that the BBC was managed at all, if I remember at the time, and also could demonstrate efficiency, Birt really was under the cosh. The BBC really had to show what it could do in two big areas: one, resources; the other, production.
default              
defaultWith hindsight I think producer choice was almost a piece of magic. Instead of having to make a big decision that said, “We are going to do everything in-house” or “everything in the marketplace,” it created a mechanism that allowed producers to decide. So it said to producers, “It is up to you. If dealing with the degree of inflexibility and higher costs is worth it to you creatively—because that editor, that camera crew, that particular resource, is worth it, in terms of you getting the best outcome—that is fine. If on the other hand you are happy to go outside, to use this cheaper facility, greater flexibility, so on and so forth, and spend the extra money on something else, like more shooting days or better graphics, whatever it might be, then you are entirely able to do that.” So it put the power in the hands of producers and said, “Off you go. You choose”. It was a genuine market test.

defaultWithin about five years the BBC’s in-house resource base had been significantly depleted. It still has a resource base doing key things, like news and some current affairs and some broadcast operations, but my guess is that as a result of that process—which was 15 or 20 years ago—the BBC has since saved licence payers hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of pounds. It was a proper market test and none of the downsides that were supposed to occur did. I was—people were legitimately worried. But has quality gone down? No. I think if anything programmes are probably better made now, technically and in lots of other ways, than they were before. Has training stopped? No. The supply of talent coming through is an issue but has it dried up? No, it has not. So none of the downsides have applied and all that has happened is that the BBC has been delivering demonstrably better value to licence payers.
default              
defaultThe Birt revolution kind of stopped halfway, for a variety of reasons. The next big thing was production and I think the problem with the quota system is that it prevents a similar kind of market test from applying. I would not say—partly for reasons that Claire gives—that as a matter of ideological preference the BBC should or should not work in-house. I have worked in-house. There are many talented people in-house. I think I have made some of my best programmes in-house at the BBC as a programme maker. Nevertheless I think to demonstrate efficiency in 
defaultausterity 
defaultBritain
default is vitally important. The challenge is 
defaultabsolute
defaultly vital for the BBC. For all the accountability that exists at the moment, too much of it is too opaque. It needs a mechanism to demonstrate it. As a first step, I think proper consideration needs to be given to whether—even if some areas like news, current affairs and some of these things are excluded—the 50% in-house quota is tenable. At some point it is clear that the pent-up demand from commissioners, schedulers and channel executives to go indie is tangible. So I think the 50% quota, put baldly, is hard to sustain.
default              
defaultI am not saying the BBC should not do things in-house but I think they need to find some mechanism for disciplining the process.
default              
defaultThe other thing I would point out is that on the backstop argument about BBC Worldwide, I think somebody needs to run a counterfactual on it. I do not have a problem with BBC Worldwide and I am all in favour of licence payers getting the benefit of the exploitation of the rights that they have paid to create. I buy all of those arguments. But in the last set of annual reports the return to the BBC from BBC Worldwide—turnover roughly 
default£
default1.2 billion—was 
default£
default156 million composed of 
default£
default74.4 million of investment and 
default£
default57.3 million of dividends. So the 
default£
default74.4 million of investment is investment in new content. Once upon a time BBC Worldwide operated on the basis that they would put as much money into programming investment as they could, in order, I think, to avoid paying it to HMRC—the predecessor. So the interpretation of what was a commercial investment was biased towards putting as much into programmes as possible. In more recent years the requirement for BBC Worldwide to show that it is profitable has led to a change in investment policy. The easiest way of making BBC Worldwide more and more profitable is to invest less. So take more of your revenue and declare it as profit: just change the balance; change the attitude to investment. I am only saying this because now, today, BBC Worldwide’s investments in content are very commercial. To that extent I have no doubt that the commercial marketplace would step in to replace all of what BBC Worldwide currently invests in programmes. In principle I have no real doubt about that. The marketplace will do it because once upon a time the lot of them were borderline commercial investments and therefore you would struggle to get the commercial investor to take on the risk. These days I think it would naturally follow.
default              
defaultSo you have the whole shooting match delivering—if you exclude the investment—around 
default£
default60 million. Somebody needs to run a counterfactual supposing in-house production went from 50% to 25% or 30%. How much would the BBC save in terms of its ongoing actual costs, and how does that compare to the benefit of having the r
defaultights
default? Again, I do not have an answer to this question but it seems to me that that counterfactual urgently needs to be run because, in terms of being seen to be as efficient as possible, it is really important that some of these things are opened up. I do not say the BBC should not produce in-house. That is not my point. But I think that licence payers deserve a level of transparency about the actual costs of this. It may be that in-house production will always be more expensive. I buy that. Maybe it should be. Maybe the BBC needs to do some things in-house that the marketplace simply will never do because they never would. Again, this is not an ideological question but the underlying efficiency issues that sit in the middle of the production entity I think are serious. Put it in the context of DQF, 20% savings and so on. When I say “radical efficiency” it is the third option. The completion of the Birt revolution I think is overdue.
default&#xa0;defaultQ43 default&#xa0; 
defaultTracey Crouch:default It is a really good question and I am sure it is something we will pick up with future witnesses.
defaultI have run out of time for my questions but one of the things I would be interested in, and that you could perhaps write to the Committee with, is any
default 
defaultevidence of international 
defaultcomparisons. I know, Claire, that you mention 25% being standard for PSBs in your evidence. If you have anything else from an international perspective that you could add to that—including WoCC or whatever the comparative would be internationally—that would be really helpful for us in future.
defaultClaire Endersdefault: I also wanted to put on the record—
defaultChair:default I am getting extremely concerned that we have spent an hour and a half and we have not got on to the main subject yet.
defaultClaire Endersdefault: —that some of these products were made in the nations and regions very specifically. I just want to remind people the programme budget of the BBC is not some kind of mass slush fund. It is allocated to different locations in the 
defaultUK
default.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: Chairman, could I just add two tiny points? 
default              
defaultYou should ask ITV plc how they work that. They have a strong interest in building their in-house production business. But if you are running an ITV broadcast, you do not want to be constrained in terms of winning the ratings battle by being forced to commission in-house. If you had Adam Crozier here I am sure he would explain to you what that tension means. But the big difference is that ITV productions can make for anyone. In-house BBC productions can only make for the BBC. So you can look at it from a BBC perspective—what is good for the BBC—or you can look at it from a creative economy perspective: why should the biggest single production business in the country only make for one broadcaster? Is this a natural way for creative people to operate? As a creative producer do I wake up in the morning thinking, “What is the best programme I could ever make?” or, “What is the best programme I could ever make for BBC One at 
default2.15 in
default the afternoon?” I suspect it is the first. We do limit ourselves by looking after the BBC as an institution rather than the creative economy as a whole. I am not saying it is wrong. I am just saying that my personal recommendation was that BBC productions should be released outside the BBC because, in the interests of the nation, it would do us more good, in that it would generate more revenue for UK plc rather than for BBC itself. That is the other counterfactual that you should put alongside the one that Steve just mentioned.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ44 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Sutcliffe:default I will try to be brief, Chairman. Two issues affect my view of the BBC. One is sports and the other is the nations and regions. As an MP in 
defaultYorkshire
default I see BBC commissioning as vitally important to us. For instance, I do not think “
defaultBollywood Carmen
default”
default 
defaultwould have happened had it not been for the fact that the BBC commissioned it to take place and show the background of 
defaultBradford
default. I think Steve is right that the in-house balance is important but I think more people will move to the independents if they have that 
defaultopportunity
default. We discovered when we went to visit Sky that Sky have doubled their budget in terms of drama commissioning, and I think other independents are also going to grow. The growth of independents has been a benefit to the nation and the regions: we have seen lots more independent companies in 
defaultYorkshire
default. So it would be interesting to quantify that in terms of where we are heading.
defaultBut go to sports. It is only three or four years since Ben and I were trying to keep the Crown jewels of sport with the BBC: the 
defaultDerby
default; the Grand National; the Ashes; the FA Cup Final; the Rugby League Cup Final. They have gone. I quite happily pay my subscription to Sky to watch the Premier League and whatever and I get BT Sport, because I have BT broadband. 
defaultThe BBC had no control over that because that was taken out of their hands by the marketplace in terms of the deals that were done.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: Can that be right? The 
defaultDerby
default and the Grand National have gone to Channel 4.
defaultMr Sutcliffe:default They have gone to Channel 4. The BBC decided not to continue covering racing. It was a decision that they took.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: That is right. But in terms of the list of events it is still with a 95% broadcaster.
defaultMr Sutcliffe:default In that sense. But the point I am trying to make is that, whether it was the Premier League Sky deal or whatever, things were taken out of their control by the pricing policy. The public service ethos is no longer there in terms of the provision of sport because they have not been able to be in control of that. Yet people are still paying their licence fee for a contribution towards sport. Is there not a case where the BBC is going to have to look at the idea perhaps of a premium sports channel that they might want to get involved with? I am just concerned that the BBC thinks that, yes, it has a high-profile sports department and, yes, its sports personality is great, but in fact the provision of mainstream sport is no longer available to them.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: The truth of the matter is that the BBC does a large amount of excellent, brilliant sports coverage. It was over-praised for the Olympics, of which very little was BBC production—it was a whole range of broadcasters; BBC was the impresario for the 
defaultUK
default audience—but outside the Olympics it does a lot. I share your view that the BBC is artificially constrained in bidding for sports rights because it does not want to run a premium sports channel, as that would be a breach of the licence fee principle. My view is that if it did have a premium channel it would be able to feed a lot of sport into its basic tier—what I would call the base licence fee-pricing tier—from its premium service. The two would work together. Indeed, I think the BBC would be more successful in the sports market with a two-pronged approach than anybody else. It would be successful against Sky. It would be successful against BT. The problem the BBC has had is constraints over airtime. It dropped out of test matches not because of list events or Sky or whatever. It dropped out to Channel 4 because it just could not devote the airtime. It did not have enough space in its schedule. If you have a premium service—
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: It could have done. It decided not to.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: It decided not to. But it had never shown an entire test match in its entire history. It was always interrupted with racing or rowing or some other thing. It was a piece of a jigsaw. It was never a thing in itself. With a premium channel, of course, you can do all that. You can devote as much time as you like. So I think you are probably right that the BBC’s role in sport will continue to erode under the present funding arrangements, although it will still do whatever it does really well.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ45 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Sutcliffe:default Why will that not happen to other sectors? Why will that not happen to the production in terms of drama productions? Is this not a road to what is likely to happen at the end?
defaultClaire Endersdefault: I am afraid that is not the case because sport has long been an extraordinary focus of huge economic value for subscription services. Also in the end it is the clubs that determine the structures of the auctions. This is the area we specialise in and all I can tell you is that it is very terrifying for the 
defaultUK
default, with a market of just shy of 
default£
default13 billion of total income from advertising and pay, for there to be 
default£
default2 billion of annual payments for sports rights. Given how many minutes are devoted to it, it is a real worry for the rest of the market. You have to remember that the Champions League bid from BT Sport took the Champions League off ITV. There was no way that ITV or Sky or the BBC could ever compete with BT Sport having regulated cash flows and devoting them in that way.
default&#xa0;defaultQ46 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Sutcliffe:default The public are prepared to pay the subscriptions because the public want to watch it.
defaultClaire Endersdefault: How do you know that, Mr Sutcliffe? You do not know that in advance. You do not know how these models are evolving and you do not know what is driving BT and Sky into this extraordinary battle. But I can tell you something for nothing, which is that it is completely 
defaultinappropriate
default for the BBC to wade in when there are that many hundreds of millions flooding into the clubs. I have written about this. I will tell you very seriously that women account for the majority of all media consumption in this country—television, radio, newspapers, magazines and so on—and there is not a woman in this country who is applauding these vast sums of money being spent on sport.
defaultMr Sutcliffe:default I am not applauding it.
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: Just to take the point in simple terms, the reason why what has happened in sport will not happen in other genres is because they do not drive subscription in the same way that sport does. So sport—premium sport—is quite unique. It drives subscription. That is why that has happened. It is now beyond the reach of the BBC. They can play round the edges. All sorts of issues come up. We keep getting back to the subscription question, which I am sure we are going to get to. All sorts of issues come up if the BBC were to have its own dedicated sports channel. You have other people doing it. Do you need another one? But premium drama, even when it is attractive to subscribers, does not do the same thing. So those markets in other genres of programming are not materially affected by the same dynamics that you see in sport.
defaultChair:default We are now finally going to get to funding, which we seem to have talked about for the last half hour.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ47 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default David and Claire, a number of other countries with strong public service broadcasting traditions have moved away from a licence fee, either to funding their public service broadcasting by general taxation or to funding it by household charge. Would that not overcome some of your objections to the licence fee without jeopardising the funding stream or the BBC’s independence?
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: I think it would be significantly fairer at the 10% rate if we went down the Finnish/Swedish route rather than what we have at the moment. In other words, that instead of a separate licence fee with all the collection costs involved and prosecutions for evasion and so on, it was paid for out of a ring-fenced identified surcharge on your income tax. It would be socially fairer. It would be economically fairer. It would be more efficient as well. If that were to 
defaulthappen, I would be very relaxed. I still do not think it would be the best thing for the BBC because I think the BBC could do better, but it is better than what we have at the moment. What we have at the moment is not terrible; it is just for me personally painful because I do go to magistrates courts and I do watch unfortunate people being re-prosecuted year after year after year because they are known offenders. It is a very awkward situation to be in.
defaultThat being said, Greg Dyke a couple of years ago recommended that the licence fee should be collected through local authority or electricity charges, which is what a lot of other EU countries do because it is, again, an efficiency issue and it takes away the curse of criminalisation. There are other ways of delivering a similar outcome to the present with slightly less social victimisation and a little bit more efficiency. As you know, for me they do not go to the root of the problem, which is: is there a better way of allowing the BBC to flourish in the media market?
defaultClaire Endersdefault: There are some interesting problems with the licence fee. The first one is that—as David correctly said in his book—there is no licence fee payment for radio, for online, for iPlayer, for many other forms of the BBC’s output today. There is no specific charge. That charge, the licence fee, is the TV charge because it is related to the TV set.
defaultI have looked at this and I have thought about what the trade-offs are. To my mind, the fact that 97% of households—this invalidates David’s view that there is a 10% pain threshold. There may be at the magistrates court level, but to my mind that is not the BBC’s fault and that is an issue for you guys to think about. I do not accept that there is some kind of 10% iniquity in the existing licence fee because it is a ubiquitous appliance.
defaultTo your point, the German system has strengthened public service broadcasting. I spend a lot of time in 
defaultGermany
default. They have some very exciting, very strong businesses there like ProSieben, Sky Deutschland and the public service broadcasters. Germany has the same level of pretension that the UK has to be a world-beating culture, to have history programmes on public service broadcasting and all kinds of other things, a very well-funded news service, an extraordinary range of documentaries and also, above all, a mandated position for public service broadcasters in sport. To your point, there is an awful lot more sport on German public service broadcasting than there is anywhere else in 
defaultEurope
default. That is a compact that is agreed by that nation. It is also a compact of that nation that there are very strong regional broadcasters, which invariably and inevitably will make broadcasting more expensive. To top it all off, 
defaultGermany
default is also a country that has a very significantly larger number of households than we do—37 million versus our 27 million. 
defaultTo those people who think that the BBC is gaining, the BBC is gaining every year not just from immigration but from divorce and from the rise of the single lady and the single urban male. These are phenomena that are related to our economic prosperity, our ability to have more households and the desire for home ownership in the 
defaultUK
default. 69% of people in this country own their home. Home ownership drives this society to an extraordinary degree and drives the sense of entrepreneurship and where we all are culturally.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ48 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default 
defaultGermany
default has moved towards a household charge, hasn’t it? You have not addressed my question as to why that would not be potentially better than the current licence fee.
defaultClaire Endersdefault: No, I can tell you why. We have done the analysis of the costs of that transition and we believe there is no argument for going from 97% effective tax on 
defaulthouseholds because 97% of households have a TV set in this country. I am just saying to you that we have established the differences between the German situation and the one that we have. I think it would be an interesting exercise to do, but I am not entirely sure that the cost-benefit analysis yields any real measure of increased fairness or efficiency of collection. The issue that David raises about civil versus criminal is a different one. The German transition—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ49 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default We could make it less regressive.
defaultClaire Endersdefault: Are the costs of moving from what we have now to that system worth the effort?
default&#xa0;
defaultQ50 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default Even with young people’s changing consumer patterns?
defaultClaire Endersdefault: Young people, 16 to 25 year-olds, are very, very big supporters of the BBC. I am sure if they could get out from under their parents’ feet and stop using their Sky Go accounts they would be delighted, if they could get on the property ladder. They are freeloaders on the system at the moment.
defaultNo, it is worth thinking about. I would urge you to ask the BBC or whoever does the collection—I am sorry, I have forgotten who exactly does it—to establish that. I can tell you that, having looked at the German system and the costs of transitioning to the German system, I would be surprised if this was really a financial return for us as taxpayers.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ51 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default David, I think you mentioned a figure of around 15% or 20% that you think the BBC’s reach would be reduced by if it moved to subscription. How is that figure arrived at?
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: There is no way of having a precise figure. There have been a lot of tests done in the abstract by the BBC, 
defaultLondon
default 
defaultBusiness
default 
defaultSchool
default, Ofcom and so on, and even recently in its own preparation for charter renewal by the BBC, which is: what would happen if the licence fee became voluntary? Put aside subscription, how many people would stop paying if you had to opt out of the licence fee? The estimates I have heard are 10% to 20%.
defaultThe reason I think it would be quite a low number is that the average amount of time people spend with BBC television at the moment is about 10 hours a week. To give up 10 hours a week of entertainment for the sake of £11 a month does not seem to me to be a powerful likelihood. 60% of the population take subscription channels. The average cost is £30 a month. Some people pay as much as £60 a month. What we know from the previous studies is that roughly 80% of people say they would keep the BBC if the cost of doing so was no different from the licence fee. As I said before, a significant proportion would pay double or even treble.
defaultWithin the 20%, what you have to look at is what the behaviour would be if the charge turned into a per set charge rather than a per household charge. If it were a per set charge, that would probably drop down to £10, £9 or even £8 a month. Of course, the average home has three sets. I have Sky multi-room because it is economically efficient for me. It is an extra charge per month, but at least I get Sky on both sets. I have Freeview on five television sets. Would I have a full range of BBC channels on all five of my television sets? Probably not. But I would have it on at least two, perhaps three, and I would have basic channels on the other two. You have much more flexibility. The lowest-tier charge would be significantly lower than 
defaultthe current licence fee, but the average amount you will spend would probably be in the £150 range, on top of which you would then have a VAT charge. In collection terms, it would be a lot easier because roughly 60% of homes could simply add the licence fee monthly cost to their Sky, Virgin Media or BT monthly cost painlessly.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ52 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Would every household not have to go out and buy a box for every set? If you were differentiating between sets, do you not have to have conditional access per set?
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: Per set, yes, for any that were not already connected to Sky, Virgin Media or BT. You probably have about 30% of TV sets that you would have to upgrade. Everyone has been through the economics of that, the swap-out, and it is not the most difficult aspect of this. The most difficult aspect is pricing and working out what the pricing should be. It is very awkward for the BBC to deal with this because as soon as they talk about subscription it looks as if they have given up on the licence fee, which, of course, is not true. It is a bit like dealing with 
defaultScotland
default. As soon as the BBC admits that it is talking to Alex Salmond about a post-referendum outcome, it looks as if they are accepting that there will be Scottish independence. It is tricky for the BBC to model this except in extreme privacy. I know they do model it because they have to, but whether they will share that modelling with you I do not know.
defaultClaire Endersdefault: Can I just make a further point? Following on from the logic of the TV licence fee, the fact is you would also have marooned radio and the online and everything else, the technology stuff that the BBC does and the archives and all of its panoply of activities in the nations and regions. All of that would go out. The BBC Gaelic service, which exists for 50K Gaelic speakers at the moment, would probably be gone in a moment. Again, I urge you to think long and hard about radio and how significant it is. If you go down the route of charging for a TV subscription, there are very great complications around the radio services and the online services and how to charge for those. I do not think that a TV licence fee on its own is encompassing the range of consumption of the British public. Given that it is an average of a third of all media consumption, I think you would be crazy to forget about that panoply of consumption and just focus on TV.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: I am sure Ben will have read my evidence in which I say a condition of allowing the BBC to go down the subscription route would be that they must spend 20% of their income on radio services, as they currently do, which would be free to air.
defaultClaire Endersdefault: But why should people pay for those?
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: Claire, you have to take the emotion out of this.
default&#xa0;defaultQ53 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Farrelly:default While you are putting rather too much in it.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: Sorry, Paul. What you are trying to do is look rationally and logically at what the options are. Every option has a downside; every option has an upside. There is no unique formula and it is a mistake to be so attached to one mechanism.
defaultClaire Endersdefault: Which you are. You have spent 30 years on subscription.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: I have recommended it.
defaultClaire Endersdefault: 30 years, David.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: It has been adopted by the Peacock Committee, by the Burns Committee, hopefully by the Whittingdale Committee, you never know—
defaultClaire Endersdefault: But no one else.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: —and eventually by the BBC. I am only recommending it because I think it would make the BBC better. I may be wrong; I am quite relaxed about that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ54 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default Claire, do you accept that, when it comes to drama, over the last 20 years it has been a subscription channel—HBO—that has knocked the socks off everybody else consistently and still does?
defaultClaire Endersdefault: The 
defaultUS
default market has 97% of households that subscribe on a vast scale and they spend hundreds of dollars a month, in part on this and in part on 500 other channels. This is a nation of 310 million people; we are a nation of 68 million. Get real: we are making the most beautiful television as this tiny little nation. As Magnussen said in “
defaultSherlock
default”
default,
default “You are a tiny, little, feeble nation but you’re a fantastic Petri dish”. 
default[Interruption.] 
defaultNo, let me finish, I am sorry. The BBC and ITV, and Channel 4 at some level, have been able to make extraordinary television that sells all over the world and they have done that for decades. In part, that is because the BBC originated in music, in film and in television. The 
defaultUK
default had an originating role not just in the technology but also in the creation of new concepts, in the meshing of our theatrical tradition, of our educational tradition. If you hear the voices on British television, they use very wonderful, complicated words. All I can tell you is that the BBC and ITV make beautiful things. They are not directly comparable with what HBO makes.
defaultI would have loved it if the BBC had made “The Sopranos”, which is on the same level as the great dramas of the Greeks and so on. It came out of the 
defaultUS
default market because it is a set of US stories. I am glad that our level of violence is not sufficient to fund endless numbers of anything other than the murder stuff that we do. So, I do not accept that. There was an article in the Christmas issue of 
defaultThe
default 
defaultEconomist
default that referred to 
defaultBritain
default’s soft power in the world. You hear this constantly from people like Lucian Grainge, who is the Chief Executive of UMG, who is British, who works in LA, who says, “Everywhere you hear British voices in our creative culture here”.
default              
defaultChair:default Sorry, we are going to need to move people on.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: Can I just make a very simple point? The BBC’s income is roughly five times that of HBO in terms of revenues. HBO chooses to spend all its money on roughly 150 hours a year of output. The BBC does 5,000 hours. That is the economics of it. It is not that the 
defaultUS
default market is richer; it is that HBO chooses to spend its money in a particular way. Only 50% of households in the 
defaultUS
default subscribe to HBO and the average price per month is less than £10. You have HBO, you have AMC, you have FX, you have Bravo; there are 18 different broadcasters in the 
defaultUS
default that have the spending power of ITV1 and BBC1. It is the competition between those 18—and now Netflix and Amazon are joining in—that generates these very high profile drama series.
defaultClaire Endersdefault: It is a market of $160 billion and this is a market of £13 billion.
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: Just a couple of observations, if I may. First of all—and everybody knows this—the dynamics of successful subscription broadcasters are different. HBO’s subscriber base is based on all sorts of things, not especially performance of its dramas. Sky, similarly, has a subscriber base based on movies and premium sport, and that is one of the reasons why Sky is able to behave differently when it comes to the drama and other aspects of it. You cannot read across from HBO or Sky and what they do to what the BBC would do in any circumstances if it was subscription-funded.
defaultSecondly, just a couple of things. Subscription is now probably possible, whereas when Peacock looked at it he concluded that it was not, or not as easily. It is worth taking account of what happens if you do that. First of all, there is the risk of perverse incentives. If you make the BBC’s revenues dependent upon the sale of subscriptions to its services, then you run the risk that what the BBC will do is begin to, as night follows day, follow the money. It will begin to refocus its services towards revenue maximisation. That is a risk. I am not saying it is inevitable, but it is certainly a risk one would have to beware of. You do see elements of this, of course, in the way the BBC is funded now, but not in quite such a direct way—the 6 Music case being a case in point—making sure that you do not lose the upmarket, relatively young, south-east-based, high-value licence payers. It is clearly a factor in the politics of what the BBC chooses to do and not do. Whether my mum in 
defaultBirmingham
default would get quite the same level of consideration for her local radio service I am not entirely certain. The other thing, of course, is that you run the risk that the BBC sacrifices universality. That is the risk.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ55 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default Is there also a problem with the licence fee? Hence things like “
defaultThe Voice
default”, which 
defaultbecause
default the BBC can get these high ratings by chasing that justifies the licence fee. The same applies, doesn’t it?
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: Okay, that is true except that my mum and millions of people who do not watch much else do watch “
defaultStrictly Come Dancing
default” and “
defaultThe Voice
default” and they enjoy it hugely.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ56 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default But then that can be on a subscription.
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: Up to a point, except that the dynamics of subscription are that it is a different marketplace. All I am saying is that you run the risk that, first, you produce perverse incentives, and secondly, the BBC’s universality goes out of the window. To take the point we discussed earlier, it may be that there are some BBC services, some sort of access to what the BBC does, that might appropriately be funded by subscription. But as soon as you bring subscription into the core of what the BBC does, there are big questions that people would require some sensible answers to in terms of what then happens. It is a much bigger shift than that. The licence fee is imperfect in many, many ways. The question is whether it remains the least bad option.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ57 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default Can I assume from everything that has been said about funding so far—because the word that has not really been mentioned is taking advertising on—that advertising is not going to be able to carry the cost of the BBC?
defaultClaire Endersdefault: That is right. We know the market structure backwards. If you were to look at the final page of my submission you would see that there is a very great linearity. This is an oligopoly and everybody has their place in the market, including Sky and the digital channels, which also survive on a mixture of advertising and so on. There is enormous evidence that 
defaultthe 
defaultUK
default is a maxed-out market. It has had real trouble growing at an average of 3% so I think it is quite excluded. I would not exclude it as something that the BBC should pursue. To my mind, it should go for a mix of advertising and subscription if it goes down that road at all. It would absolutely ditch public service broadcasting and, indeed, it would have to ditch the fact that, after all, there is a whole swathe of the population of OAPs that are under a certain level of income that do not pay the licence fee at all today. You would have to address their needs as well. I would have thought that a mix of advertising and subscription was absolutely the way to go.
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: It is fair to say, is it not, that there is no reason to think that if the BBC were to take advertising, advertising revenues would grow commensurate with the loss of licence fee revenue that would be associated with it?
defaultClaire Endersdefault: No.
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: As a result, if advertising were to fund the BBC at anything like its current scale, that would be at the cost of all the other commercial broadcasters.
defaultClaire Endersdefault: And also in radio.
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: It is not that it would not grow at all, but it is pretty—
defaultClaire Endersdefault: And that is absolutely the case in radio.
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: There is not £3.6 billion of advertising waiting to happen.
defaultClaire Endersdefault: No.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ58 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default There is a finite amount?
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: Yes, noticeably.
defaultClaire Endersdefault: We already have the highest spending market in 
defaultEurope
default, in terms of the combination of revenues by a very long way. That is because British people spend on quality across the board. We also spend more on books, magazines and newspapers than any other nation. We are already maxed out on TV income, in terms of advertising and subscription and the licence fee and so on. That is another problem with the subscription argument. I just do not think there is a lot of extra subscription in the market.
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: Again, you also run the risk with advertising, even if it is introduced in small ways in some areas—and we have seen examples of this in some of the BBC’s international operations—of perverse incentives where the pursuit of revenue begins to infect editorial decision making and judgments. It is pretty effective if you ask me.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: We have plenty of evidence that increasing the supply of advertising space reduces the average price. ITV and Channel 4 have been through this quite recently. It is clear that if the BBC suddenly made available as much advertising space—8 minutes per hour—as is available on ITV and Channel 
default4 in
default TV terms, everyone’s prices would drop. Not only would you not replace the licence fee revenue, you would do significant damage to a lot of other broadcasters. Oddly enough, in radio it is a two-pronged argument. I used to be chairman of the Commercial Radio Companies Association. There was a school of thought that said if Radios 1 and 2 took advertising, at least the advertising market in radio would be 
defaultthat much larger and it would be taken more seriously as a medium. That was not a majority view, but there was a view to that effect.
defaultAs for combining advertising and subscriptions, if the BBC were ever to go down the subscription route it would require extremely careful planning. I would expect that the BBC would be required to make all its public affairs programmes free to air, unscrambled. It would be required to carry on doing a great number of public services because it would still be occupying a huge amount of public spectrum however it was funded. You could continue to make nation and region requirements, the so-called public service content requirements, which are still measured by Ofcom regularly and which the BBC, by the way, has been reducing its spend on year by year despite having the licence fee. The BBC has been worse than ITV in reducing its spend on the designated public service genres, according to Ofcom. We are in a situation where public service broadcasting is not doing as well as it should be because of a series of pressures in the marketplace and we ought to be addressing that. That is part of an argument about how the BBC should be funded as well. In my view, where we are at the moment is steady drift downwards.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ59 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default Can we just go back? Was the original thought about having a licence fee to somehow preserve some kind of purity around this public service broadcasting organisation, in which somehow it was not going to be tainted with commercial considerations?
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: If you go back to the very beginning of it, you find that it was the newspaper proprietors who were absolutely opposed to broadcasting taking advertising. At the time, they had a monopoly of it and they were absolutely vociferous. Of course, c’est la vie, their way prevailed and so another means of doing it was invented. It is also an interesting twiddle in the original idea that the licence was a licence to receive broadcasts. That is because, of course, they realised eventually they could not stop the Germans from broadcasting; better find out who could receive it. Of course, once there are a million radios in existence that becomes a facile argument.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: For 33 years the licence fee was the right. You subscribed to the BBC, radio or television, colour or black and white television. Three different licence fees were applied. Indeed, when the BBC brought in its digital services its preference was to have a separate digital licence fee. That was overruled by 
default10 Downing Street
default, but that was the recommendation from Gavyn Davies and his expert committee, the BBC itself, and from Chris Smith as Secretary of State. It is not as if there is some purity or even universality attached to how you fund the BBC and the licence fee gives you all of these moral benefits.
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: That is not why it started and it is not always the practice that has been adopted. Generally speaking, most people in the BBC—and you may say, “They would, wouldn’t they?”—do feel that they are subject to special and different obligations, partly because of the way it is financed, and a claim to universality runs through the organisation.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: Well, universality never turned up until 1990 if you look at the history of the BBC.
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: Universality as the broad brush, the broad thrust of what the BBC does, runs through it like 
defaultBrighton
default through a stick of rock.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ60 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default Looking at the other way, perhaps, of funding, which would be through taxation, would that have the danger of taking it too close to politicians, who could ultimately start waving their powers?
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: A point where I think I would concur with David is that there is already an issue about that to some extent. If there is a weakness in the licence fee it is that taxation gets you even closer to this. My own view is that the further away you stay from politics in that sense, the better. Already you can see that, since Mark Thompson, with every licence fee settlement there has been a kind of deal. Lord Fowler was absolutely vociferously opposed to it. I think some people in this room were, too, if I recall. The Thompson deal, the £600 million of digital switchover help scheme—
defaultClaire Endersdefault: It has gone to BT.
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: Well, the argument being that digital switchover was a Government industrial policy; it should, therefore, be paid for through taxation, progressive and so on, not through dipping into the licence fee. That was the deal John Birt offered in exchange for a very generous licence fee settlement, which I remember he complained of not being enough but nevertheless it was huge, unthinkably huge as an increase by today’s standards, off the back of all the things the BBC was doing to drive digital 
defaultBritain
default. Then with the last settlement we have funding of the World Service, Caversham, S4C and 
defaultx
default hundred million going to broadband rollout. A big question coming up here for charter review is going to be: what will the Government’s take be? What will the BBC offer? What will the Government expect? If you want my honest personal opinion, that is a deeply, deeply unhealthy set of circumstances.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ61 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default Is that an argument for general taxation, then, rather than a licence fee?
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: Well, except that with general taxation you would probably make the problem worse. I do not know if we are going to talk about the BBC’s kerfuffles with the Public Accounts Committee and the National Audit Office. It is very easy to stand and take a position that says, “Obviously, the BBC is a public corporation. It is using public money. Therefore, open access to NAO.” On one hand, it seems straightforward. The BBC has made the argument for us or for anyone who wants to advocate that by the way they dealt with executive pay and so on. It is a very clear and simple argument.
defaultComing to it another way round, they say, “Hold on a minute: the BBC is a creative organisation that needs, above all, autonomy,” because autonomy and creativity in my experience are absolutely inextricably linked. Without autonomy, you do not have creativity. In editorial terms, independence is absolutely the bedrock of it. Without that the whole thing is almost pointless, you could argue.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ62 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default But you could argue it should not have scrutiny.
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: No, this is not an argument against scrutiny. All it is saying is, be very careful about how you go about it because it is stating the obvious, isn’t it, that editorial and creative and financial at some point—should you buy this building or sit in that building? Easy. Should you spend four or six days filming an episode of “
defaultEastenders
default”? Difficult. These things are all intertwined. My own view, for what it is worth, is: what do I worry about? I worry that it is all getting too close anyway.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ63 default&#xa0; 
defaultAngie Bray:default Quite a lot of this is going to be overtaken by the arrival of the internet and the fact that we may all be looking at ways of raising funding for the BBC. Even the BBC’s own iPlayer effectively means that if you did not have a television in the house but you do have a computer, there are ways of enjoying the programmes without paying anything for them. How much is that going to affect how we go forward with funding?
defaultClaire Endersdefault: Remember that we have spent the last 10 or 12 years with the whole issue. Remember that people thought that people would be primarily watching via PC by 
default2010. In
default fact, the BBC itself came up with preposterous views on the matter a decade ago. Ofcom also predicted that we would be looking at massive non-linear viewing, but we do not. At the moment, the bulk of non-linear viewing is to the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 and there is a very large group of viewing that is to pirated material and to pornography, and that accounts for 40% of all online video use in this country.
defaultI have to say that to my mind the prevalence of illegal options, pirated options and so on, reinforces the argument to have a locus of quality. I am only saying that as a woman who likes very high quality choices not interrupted by ads. You could say that 52% of the population is irrelevant. However, I would say that with the median age where we are and the device penetration that we have, we have seen an incredible adherence to linear viewing, and non-linear viewing is primarily a subset of linear viewing because the bulk of legitimate choices rest on the BBC, iPlayer, Channel 4, ITV and so on.
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: All of which is true. All on-demand viewing is between 10% and 15%, 15% at the most, and 90% plus of that is catch-up on Sky+, V+ and Freeview.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: I do not think people are going to throw out their television sets even though they have computers.
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: No, but the last big speech that Tony Hall made where he talked about “my BBC”, personalisation of services and enhanced iPlayer envisaged a future whereby most licence payers would get access to most BBC services through something resembling an iPlayer portal. Now, I happen to think that that is miles away.
defaultClaire Endersdefault: Miles away.
defaultAngie Bray:default It still has to be thought about, though.
defaultClaire Endersdefault: Yes, but it is 20 years.
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: Yes, and that does raise obvious questions not so much about universality in the sense, “Is it available free at the point of use?” but as soon as people conceptualise in that very direct way, “my BBC”, then it stands to reason that that is not. There is an argument that there is something rather diffuse, rather woolly but nevertheless real, which is the sense that we all pay the same and we all get what we get and we accept that we use this and we use that and you use that and you use that. There is an element of collective enterprise about it that, when you break it down into personalised services—which may be the way it goes—it opens up a question about subscription not so much in terms of the detail about how it is funded but in terms of the way people feel about what they are doing. It may be that in the longer term people’s attitudes towards these things will change, not least because the way they receive and access them will change because technology takes it that way and the BBC, of course, is intending to drive it that way.
default              
defaultChair:default We are going to have to move on because otherwise we will be here all afternoon.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ64 default&#xa0; 
defaultJim Sheridan:default The figures that I have seen are that the popularity of the licence fee is increasing in the last decade. I think it is up to 47% compared with 31% just a decade ago. What I am intrigued by is that the costs of collecting the licence fee are relatively low. Would there be any significant change for the alternative method, subscription?
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: Well, intrinsically you have two costs with the licence fee. One is the cost of evasion; one is the cost of collection. Between the two of them, they are somewhere in the £250 million to £300 million range. Therefore, you have to look at what conditional access management costs would be for perhaps as many as 50 million connected TVs. It is not going to be lower than that. It is not going to be much higher. It is going to be broadly comparable. As I said earlier, you can piggyback a significant proportion of that on the existing provisional access systems operated by pay TV operators roughly 60% of the population have access to at the moment. Clearly, it is an issue. It was a big issue 28 years ago. It is a much smaller issue today because we have solved most of the problems. Each year we see more and more economical ways of connecting digital content to individual devices, not just TVs but to computers, mobile phones, tablets and so on. I do not think that is the central issue.
defaultThe central issue here is political preferences, what we want the BBC to be like, and what—and I think I would put it third—the most efficient way of funding the BBC is. There are a lot of people who believe that the licence fee has some moral and political dimensions that override the modest criticisms you could make of the licence fee, and I respect that absolutely. There are some people who think that the BBC would change irrevocably if it ceased to be anchored by a licence fee. As Angie Bray was saying, at the moment, paradoxically, to sustain the licence fee the BBC has to chase audience share and reach because otherwise the argument for keeping the licence fee would go. We are in a slightly paradoxical situation at the moment but, broadly speaking, I would not elevate the issue of subscription to an overwhelming argument that must be deployed. It is a choice that should be examined.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ65 default&#xa0; 
defaultJim Sheridan:default Claire, I think you said earlier that the licence fee provides a stable funding mechanism to provide risk capital in terms of long-term projects that the private commercial market could not support. The argument would be that you would say that, wouldn’t you, because you would be able to invest in high-risk projects and if they do not work out then it is not your money you are using?
defaultClaire Endersdefault: No, I view these things in concrete terms rather than in conceptual ones. To my mind, the BBC has income that it is supposed to spend in Salford, in 
defaultScotland
default, in 
defaultWales
default, elsewhere. It is supposed to provide a mesh of services, including BBC Gaelic, including many other services that are niche services. Those are all political decisions. Those are all decisions that have been made over a very long period of time. Those are all risky propositions. They would not be undertaken by the commercial sector for sure. 
defaultSalford
default, 100% way off the agenda; nobody would be based there. You have LA and 
defaultLondon
default and those are the two world centres for production. Now you have 
defaultBeijing
default and Mumbai and so on.
defaultNo, I believe that there is an argument advanced consistently that there is a sense of doing things that the market cannot do and also taking risks, of which that is one. That is the way it is. That is what we want out of the BBC and that is what public service is. Back to the argument about institutions of this type, the NHS is a similar institution. I myself have never had anything wrong with me, I have never had to use it, but I pay for it every month with 
defaultenormous pleasure on the understanding that other people will get there first. In a sense, it is that kind of risk and longevity that I want out of the BBC and that I think is important for the society I joined.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ66 default&#xa0; 
defaultJim Sheridan:default Finally, one of the constant criticisms of the BBC is that it is too London-centric. For instance, when they moved to Salford and then they moved production for programmes like “
defaultQuestion Time
default”, some commentators were saying it was the end of the world as we knew it because of having to move outside 
defaultLondon
default. Indeed, there are constant arguments in my part of the world that in an independent 
defaultScotland
default it will be wonderful and you will get hundreds of millions of pounds for the BBC and so on. In terms of distributing BBC money out into the regions and other parts of the 
defaultUK
default, is it done fairly, do you think?
defaultClaire Endersdefault: I have had that conversation with the First Minister of Scotland. I was able to correct him. He did have the wrong view. He thought it was still in the doghouse. I was able to explain to him that as a result of his prodding the BBC had very substantially increased and now I believe that the BBC is spending more than it does per capita in Scotland than it did five years ago, let alone 10 years ago. There has been a vital change and that is part of the democratic process. You punch; you are going to get in the end. That has been very helpful.
defaultI do think it is a very basic and important part of public service broadcasting to address the needs of the whole audience. If that is the Gaelic speakers in 
defaultScotland
default—of which there are 50,000—that will be the Gaelic speakers or whatever else is decided. I do think that there has been a big increase and that the way that the nations have held the BBC and, indeed, Channel 4 to account to equalise has been very helpful. I do not think you can stop the fact that 
defaultLondon
default is a great metropolis. It is one of the world’s greatest cities. It will always absorb talent. Parliament is here. You guys are all the talent. That is also true of LA. There is only room for two of these powerhouses in the world and I do not think it invalidates the arguments for systematically, either through ITV, Channel 4 or the BBC, making sure that there are very strong partnerships. That has certainly been the case in radio. That has certainly been the case now in local television. These are important things to do. I believe that that is public service broadcasting at its best.
default              
defaultChair:default We do not have very much time. I am going to call Paul and then Philip and then we will have to draw a line.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ67 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Farrelly:default I am going to touch on governance in a moment, but before I do, David, can I just come to your forthcoming chapter again, which I enjoyed reading because it was very provocative? At the end of the day, I was not quite sure whether it was a piece of analysis or the manifesto of the Boston Tea Party. Can I come to your issue about subscription in your piece, which you are trying to encourage as a model for the BBC? On page 15, you say, “The essence of the subscription model—as HBO has shown—is the opposite of the licence fee: emphasising the very highest quality, which commands subscriber loyalty”. Then let us go to page 4, where you make the point that providers like HBO spend their content budgets on a limited number of high-ambition programmes so that people will renew their subscriptions. I put it to you: that is exactly the wrong thing that we would want to have for the BBC because the BBC offers everything to everybody.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: It is an entirely legitimate point of view, Paul, but my view is that the BBC sacrifices quality for quantity too much. Nothing the BBC produces is rubbish—they are professional people—but if you have moderate budgets and moderate ambitions, you end up with moderate programmes. Too much of the BBC’s output is in that middling range and not 
defaultenough is at the level of the Tom Stoppard “
defaultFord Maddox Ford
default” series, a brilliant piece of high ambition, high-level production, well in the range of what the major US cable providers do.
defaultIf you look at someone like HBO, you will also see that they choose to make 10 or 12 documentaries a year, only 10 or 12, but all of them are very high-ambition, high-quality and high-budget pieces. Although they do a monthly current affairs programme with Bill Maher, they do not feel the need to fill in all the spaces, whereas the BBC comes from a linear tradition, which is you are on the air, you have to fill every little gap. The cable model is different, which is we only produce a certain amount in every month and we will repeat it a dozen times, but all of it will be high quality. We do not expect you to spend hours watching it. We expect you to pick and choose. It comes from a different philosophy. My view is that if the BBC were released from the obligation to make huge amounts of programming to meet everybody’s needs, it would pick and choose more and it would winnow some of the quiz shows, daytime shows or whatever in favour of some more higher-quality shows. It would also provide more variety of content in order to attract subscribers. That is the model that subscription offers you. I think it would improve the BBC’s thinking.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ68 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Farrelly:default Time is limited now, but just one further question on this. Let me take you back to what you said right at the beginning; I jotted it down. “As long as it is funded by the licence fee it”—the BBC—will do what it does and do it “rather well”, you said.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: Yes.
defaultPaul Farrelly:default That sounds to me like a statement of, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: Yes, I would not deny that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ69 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Farrelly:default Looking at the forthcoming chapter again, it is a guesstimate. You say that people could probably get a core service of BBC1 and BBC2 for £20 less off the licence fee and then could pay subscriptions for other channels. Again, for 20 quid off the licence fee, you propose an enormous shake-up, with enormous risk, that removes the universality. You could almost see people being judged for their eligibility on free school meals as to whether they only have the basic BBC licence.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: You do not attach any value to choice?
default              
defaultPaul Farrelly:default I see choice out there.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: At the moment, you have no choice in the matter as to whether you pay for the BBC or not; 97% of the population have TVs and they are forced to pay for it whether they can afford it, whether they watch it, whether they like it. Actually, if I got 20 quid back and I had choice, I would think that was probably a good thing. It may be more than 20 quid, by the way. That is not the issue. I am trying to demonstrate through these analogies that there is a better BBC available if we want it.
default              
defaultChair:default Can we now move on to governance because we only have 15 minutes and we have not talked about governance at all?
default              
defaultPaul Farrelly:default I think it needs a redraft because it is not convincing.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: It has not convinced you.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ70 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Farrelly:default Let us get on to governance. Claire, you are very cogent in your analysis, but when it comes to governance you seem to sort of bite your lip and say very little. What has gone wrong with the BBC in terms of revenues?
defaultClaire Endersdefault: There was a constraint on the number of words we could serve up and I kept within that constraint down to the last word. I think I am just at the limit. I thought it was more important for me to convey to you what I know about, which is the world of broadcasting, the world of public service broadcasting, the world of the creative economy, and to spend my time on those fine matters than on the governance of the BBC. I run a business of 25 people. I have no experience of working at the BBC. I walk in and out of there, sometimes to appear on programmes in order to fulfil their quota of over-50s ladies or whatever it is or in order to give my opinion, which is deeply considered.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ71 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Farrelly:default What do you think has gone wrong with governance at the BBC?
defaultClaire Endersdefault: To my mind, there were obvious issues in relation to the BBC Trust when it was set up, a lack of clarity and a lack of definition of roles respectively also with the executive. This is an issue that occupies many people’s time and attention and they write about it ceaselessly. Therefore, I cannot opine on the exact structure, but clearly there was a lack of accountability and a lack of direct sense of accountability that emerged in that murky period post the Hutton report and the firing of Greg Dyke and the arrival of Mark Thompson and I do not know what. All of these things happened.
defaultMy sense of the BBC as an external perspective is that these phenomena are always very peculiar because almost any governance system tends not to work in a crisis, if you see what I mean. The main change that I saw in the last 18 months, and I say this as someone who thought that the BBC was on an excessive high in the post-Olympics phase, is that the BBC needs people who come from within it to manage it. I do not think that David’s comparison with Neil MacGregor or Neil MacGregor’s unit is appropriate. The 
defaultBritish
default 
defaultMuseum
default turns over £45 million; the BBC £3.5 billion in the mothership plus BBC Worldwide. I think there is a complexity there.
defaultMy experience of the BBC—and, in particular, I dealt with the Savile issues—is I was the person who helped the BBC to come up with a way of addressing the victims. It was completely navel-gazing and obsessed with itself in the early phase of that, and poor George Entwistle was very unwell so he did not have the ability. What I found was interesting about that scandal, and I say that as someone who spent 10 years on the board of the NSPCC, is that there were no BBC employees involved in this. This struck me as a good thing about the BBC. Although these practices may have come and gone with the presenters, there were not BBC people involved in these phenomena. The governance of the BBC may at any one time in a year not address the issues correctly, and that certainly happened with Savile, Newsnight 1 and Newsnight 2. There was a failure, to my mind, of the BBC executive in addressing those issues. That might also be true with regard to the payoffs and how that was addressed and how their evidence was given and so on. I would certainly not have gone down and made the decisions that the BBC made at every turn in the process of those scandals, but that is about the current management and the current way and the way that the BBC finds it very hard to change managers and management. That is something to do with the way the organisation is structured. I do not think that can be laid at the management’s actual door itself.
default              
defaultChair:default Can I ask you to give brief answers? I am conscious this is taking too long.
defaultClaire Endersdefault: Sorry.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ72 default&#xa0; 
defaultPaul Farrelly:default Steve, you have a long perspective. You have talked of Lord Birt. I remember when Lord Birt was a controversial character, having introduced a personal service company years ago. Do you think the issues of governance at the BBC are purely structural or largely personal through recent management, or has the slide been going on for a long time?
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: No, it is a mixture of all sorts of things. Do not underestimate the difficulty of taking a complete structural revision and making it work. As people in businesses and organisations will tell you, it takes a long time. Remember that, funnily enough, the perception that led to the abolition of the governors and the establishment of the trust, in the term that was always bandied around, was management capture: the governors were simply too close to the management and did not have enough independence and so on. Of course, the Hutton debacle was the straw that breaks the camel’s back. I am not sure in truth whether any governance structure would have dealt with that necessarily any better than the BBC did. In the end, they sacked the chief executive. That is never easy for an organisation to do. It was very public. They lost a chairman and a chief executive in one go.
defaultWhen the trust emerged, in terms of the industry the toxic issue that was bubbling was about market impact. The difficult problem with the governors—I do not mean there was a problem with the governors—or one of them, for the industry anyway, was this was cheerleader and regulator incarnate because the BBC was busy launching new services, parking its tanks on every digital lawn it could find, partly out of fear of what the digital future would bring, partly because of its imperial expansionist tendencies and all the rest of it—if they are doing it, we had better do it—potentially causing mayhem in the marketplace, investment drying up left, right and centre as the BBC would go and plan. The governors were clearly incapable of dealing with that. Funnily enough, my take on the public value test system and Ofcom’s involvement in market impact assessments is that there are market impact issues affecting the BBC still, of course, but they are much less pronounced than they were and there is a mechanism for dealing with them. On that front, I think you could say the trust has a pretty big tick.
defaultThere are all sorts of reasons going way back into the history of the last licence fee, the last charter and how it was arrived at that explain some aspects of the rigorous separation of powers that is baked into the charter and agreement, some of which have been ruthlessly exposed in the most ghastly fashion. To say to the trust, “You are the guardian of the public interest. You are there to ensure good stewardship of public money. You represent the public interest in the BBC” and so on, and then have them turn up to the Public Accounts Committee and say, “Well, executive payoffs, extra contractual millions of pounds, none of our business” is just bonkers. It is just crazy.
defaultPersonally, what do I know? It could be the system is simply knackered and it just needs to start again. It may be that when you come to it with a different way of doing it, with a more mature and sensible approach to division of powers, with a more effective system of oversight between the Trust and the BBC, it might again in the end prove to be the least worst option. The problem with throwing the whole thing up in the air again is that you will end up with another new system, which with the best of intentions and goodwill all round will have wrinkles in it that the next crisis will expose. There is at least an argument to consider, I think, “better the devil you know”. The mayhem caused by the last ruction, the creation of 
defaultthe Trust in the first place, we are still living with. I do not know if we are going to come to the executive—

defaultChair:default I am very conscious that Philip Davies has sat for two and a half hours and has not had a chance to ask anything at all and we have very little time left.

defaultQ73 default&#xa0; 
defaultPhilip Davies:default If I ask a snappy question, perhaps you can each give it an equally snappy reply. I think the question that Paul was driving at, which I would like the answer to, is: is the Trust model bust or is the current chairman of the BBC Trust a busted flush? Which of the two is it?
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: Are they alternatives?
defaultPhilip Davies:default Or both.
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: Could both be true or neither?
default              
defaultPhilip Davies:default Well, you tell me.
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: As to the assessment of the credibility and otherwise of the existing chairman, that is obviously a matter for you. It is certainly not a matter for me. Is the system bust? Well, we have certainly seen how it malfunctioned. The question now is whether that is fixable without another revolution or whether it has to be canned. My instinct, for what it is worth—it is only my instinct and what do I know? Nothing—is that it is probably fixable.
defaultClaire Endersdefault: Yes, my view is that we have had the change in management. They have put their feet under and there has been a very significant improvement in the way the BBC is dealing with things since those changes have been made. I think we should wait for the issues around the Scottish referendum in order to think through any major changes that would need to take place as a result of that if it went in the wrong direction.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: As I said in my evidence, I think we have the experience of Channel 4 and its combined board to look at, which is a much more stable and, to my mind, more rational form of governance, rather akin to the way a public company board would operate. It is a terrible mistake to allow a chief executive to be his own chairman in terms of his executive board. That was a big mistake in the charter and agreement last time to offer that option because obviously Mark Thompson took it and you got a huge tension between Thompson and Lyons. The relationship effectively broke down and that was a structural problem. Whatever else is done, I hope at least that will be corrected and that, whether you keep the trust and have a stronger executive board with more non-executives, the chief executive will have a non-executive chairperson he can talk to on a daily basis and take advice from. Part of the problem of what happened with things like the severances is you could see there was just a huge gap, ambiguity, lack of communication, nobody taking responsibility. People thought somebody had said yes; they had not. That is not just a personal thing; that is a structural thing. My view is the Trust is too far from the action and does not have a big enough knowledge base. What it does do I think it does mostly quite well, particularly in market impact terms. It failed pretty comprehensively on premium-rate phone calls and dodgy quizzes, and Ofcom proved to be a much better regulator in that respect. If you are going to change it, the Channel 4 model looks to me the obvious one.

defaultQ74 default&#xa0; 
defaultPhilip Davies:default We have one minute to go, Chairman, in your desire to finish by 1 o’clock. Could you give a one-word answer to this question: is it possible to be a cheerleader and a regulator?
defaultSteve Hewlettdefault: No, of course it is not. Except that, in my opinion, the problems that we have seen with the BBC are not fundamentally of regulation. The problems we have seen with the BBC are of governance. It is an interesting way of putting it and it is commonly put that way, cheerleader and regulator. The issue is what system can provide licence payers, the public, with reassurance that the BBC is being properly run. That in the end is going to be a matter of governance, not strictly speaking regulation.
defaultClaire Endersdefault: I agree absolutely with that comment. It is not a matter of regulation at all.
defaultDavid Elsteindefault: The non-executive directors of Channel 4 are not regulators. They run the governance system but Ofcom is the regulator dealing with all external regulatory things. If Ofcom were given more scope over the BBC, they would not be judging management contracts and severance payments because that is a combined board activity. You should not have cheerleader and regulator in the same sentence.
defaultChair:default Ben, do you want one last question on this or are you happy?
defaultMr Bradshaw:default No, not really.
defaultChair:default In that case—1 o’clock—thank you very much.
