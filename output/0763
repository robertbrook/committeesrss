default              
defaultThe Service Specification for Neuromuscular services highlights how ‘
defaultthe care of all patients should be led from a regional specialist centre with specialist Multi Disciplinary Team (MDT) providing regular local clinics’.
default default3.3
default 
default              
defaultWith the ‘best practice’ DMD and BMD care, people can live much longer and experience 
defaulta much greater quality of life.

defaultAt the moment this is not happening

default3.5
default              
defaultIn Denmark, 50% of those living with 
defaultDMD
default are over 20 years old, whilst, 
defaultonly 15
default% of those living with
default 
defaultDMD
default in the UK are over 21.
default 
defaultThe population of DMD patients in Denmark has nearly doubled since 1990.
default3.6
default              
defaultWith coming research breakthroughs and improving standar
defaultds of care, a greater number of exciting and ambitious young people living with DMD will need multidisciplinary specialist care and support. This must be planned for. 
defaultCare required for DMD:default&#xa0;
defaultSpecific issues for the consultation:default4. 
defaultThe scope for varying the current mix of service responsibilities so that more people are treated outside hospital and the consequences of such service re-design for costs and effectivenessdefault4
default.1
default 
default              
defaultThe rarity of DMD and BMD means that
default 
defaulta
defaultll
default tiers of healthcare provided 
defaultfor patients 
defaultmust be directed by 
defaultneuromuscular 
defaultspecialists. 
defaultAc
defaulttion Duchenne is concerned that moving services out of specialist centres would reduce expertise and lead to a reduction in high standards of the multi-faceted and complex care required.
default4.2
default              
defaultA great deal of our members experience poorly integrated care from professionals who do not have a full understanding of the condition both at hospitals and in local provision.default4.3
default              
defaultOur survey website, DMDCentres.org
default and our Boys to Men Campaign 
defaultoutlined 
defaultthe
default massive drop off of servi
defaultces for adults living with DMD, especially in primary care such as physiotherapy, but also with cardiac and lung monitoring.
default4.3
default              
defaultProfessor Hanna
default’s
default recent report on unplanned admissions for Neuromuscular conditions found 
defaultthat 37% of them were avoidable and
default concluded by recommending that monitoring of known neuromuscular patients and coordination of care across sub-specialties would reduce such unnecessary stress on patients and their families, as well as reducing costs.
default4.4
default              
defaultAt the momentdefault,default care is failing families and patients defaultdue to lack of understanding and expertise. This is also costing the health service more money.default4
default.4
default 
default              
defaultAs set out in the Service Specification for Neuromuscular Services, patients should be reviewed by a multidisciplinary team (comprising of neuromuscular consultants, a neuromuscular physiotherapist, a neuromuscular nurse, an occupational therapist, a speech and language therapist, a dietician, a psychologist and a neuromuscular care coordinator) every 6 months, with some patients who have rapidly progressing neuromuscular conditions (like 
defaultDMD
default) being reviewed every 3 months.
default4.5
default              
defaultThe multidisciplinary team must also act as a hub, to facilitate access to colleagues including respiratory physicians, cardiologists, clinical geneticists, orthopaedic surgeons, endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, palliative care clinicians, occupational therapists and 
defaultorthotists
default. 
defaultThere must
default be a procedure with which feedback is given and processed to inform further care decisions.
default 
defaultIndeed, if there are specific problems with a patient involvin
defaultg one of these specialists, that specialist
default should be involved in the multidisciplinary reviews.
default E.g. The Standards of Care document states that from their early teens, people living with DMD should be seen at least twice a year for the monitoring of cardiac and lung function. 
default4
default.6
default              
defaultMultidisciplinary teams must ensure communication mechanisms exist between tiers 3, 2
default and 1 so that 
defaultlocal services such as
default physiotherapy, hydrotherapy, rehabilitation
default 
defaultare well informed 
defaultof patient’s requirements
default and the condition is monitored at a regular and local level.
default4.7
default 
default              
defaultA vital part of care from April 2013 for all those with 
defaultDMD and BMD
default will be the assigned patient-held records, written and updated by the multidisciplinary team. Such records will act as a ‘passport’ for proper care, allowing professionals who are not knowledgeable about the patients
default’
default needs, to understand how to care for patients. Only with regular updates of these records will these be of use, and so Action Duchenne reiterates the need for regular 
defaultMDT
default reviews of each patient.
default4.8
default              
defaultAction Duchenne is concerned about the amount of care that will be commissioned by Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) for rare conditions, and which care will be commissioned nationally by NHS England (NHSE) and the 10 Local Area Teams (LATs). If CCGs are not responsible for improving outcomes for people living with DMD and BMD, then CCGs may neglect important primary care services and the ‘postcode lottery syndrome’ will prevail. It is also important to recognise that it is at primary level services such as physiotherapy where there are gaps. 
defaultCCGs need direction from NHSE and LATs on provision of services for rare conditions.default&#xa0;
default5default. defaultThe readiness of local NHS and social care services to treat patients with long-term conditions (including multiple conditions) within the communitydefault5
default.1 
default              
defaultPeople living with 
defaultDMD and BMD
default often experience a lack of understanding of their conditions, which
default in turn leads to bad advice, a worsening of the condition and the ‘postcode lottery’ syndrome of care.
default5
default.2 
default              
defaultFrom the 
defaultrecent 
defaultShire Report on Rare Disease Impact, 
default(487 patients and 124 caregivers) 
default50% of patients with a rare disease and their caregivers stated they received conflicting information from different
default healthcare professionals about treatment options
default. 
default5
default.3 
default              
defaultIn the same study from Shire, 62% of patients and caregivers stated they needed to provide their healthcare professionals with information on their rare disease.
default5
default.4
default              
defaultDiagnosis for 
defaultDMD
default, on average, takes over a year from primary concerns being relayed to a GP. This highlights the GPs problematic lack of expertise in D
defaultMD
default and B
defaultMD
default.
default 
default5
default.5
default 
default              
defaultA recent study by the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign 
default(600 patients and families) 
defaulthas shown that only two out five patients with Muscular Dystrophy felt that t
defaultheir GP understoo
defaultd their condition sufficiently to refer to them to the appropriate specialists,
default and more than half felt their GP’s limited knowledge of their condition mean they were unabl
defaulte to plan local care adequately
default.
default5
default.6
default 
default              
defaultThe
default report by Shire, 
defaultfound that 
defaultphysicians (
default50
default) had limited resources and information to properly dia
defaultgnose and manage rare diseases: 
default62%
default of these phys
defaulti
defaultcians
default felt that there weren’t the opportunities to network with other phys
defaulticians who treat rare diseases.
default5.7
default              
defaultAs stated, people with DMD are now living much longer, but the health service has not kept up. This has led to a dearth of services for the adult population and many ‘dropping off’ during transition. 
default5.8 
default              
defaultP
defaults
defaulty
defaultcho-social care is absolutely vital, with families affected by DMD or BMD being at a higher risk of breakup and depression. People living with these conditions must have the option of specialist psycho-social care (not just advice from Care Advisors as set out in the Service Specification). Such care is often not available locally.
default5.9
default              
defaultBreakthroughs in research 
defaultmay lead to expensive medicines coming to market. Action Duchenne is 
defaultseeking assurance that a 
default‘
defaultpostcode lottery
default’ for the funding of new drugs 
defaultwill not arise. Moreover, such drugs will have to administered and monitored by experts, therefore once again highlighting the need for regional expertise.
default&#xa0;
default6default. The practical assistance offered to commissioners to support the design of services which promote community-based care and provide for the integration of health and social care in the management of long-term conditionsdefault6
default.1 
default              
defaultAction Duchenne is concerned that at a local level, the voices of patients and families living with DMD or BMD may be drowned out when it comes to community based care.
default 
default6
default.2 
default              
defaultThe Service Specification will act as a blueprint
default for specialised services
default, but each 
defaultcommunity
default will face individual issues.
default 
defaultMDTs
default 
defaultshould work with CCGs to provide information about the 
defaultholistic spe
defaultcialised care required. 
default6.3 
default              
defaultThe Service Specification must also change to take into account treatments coming to market and react to changes in standards of care e.g. the best use of steroids.
default6
default.3 
default              
defaultHealthwatch
default will also play
default a vital role in feeding back to 
defaultLATs
default and 
defaultNHSE
default in highlighting gaps in services.
default It is important to encourage families and patients living with rare conditions to involve themselves in these organisations and for the proper time and resources to be allocated to feedback on these conditions. 
default&#xa0;
default7. defaultThe ability of NHS and social care providers to treat multi-morbidities and the patient as a person rather than focusing on individual conditionsdefault:default7.1 
default              
default8
default% of adults living with DMD in the UK live at home
default compared to 20% in Europe
default. People living with DMD must be given care and support 
defaultto fulfil their potential and be able to live independently if they wish.
default 
default              
default7.2
default              
defaultDMD
default 
defaultaffects all muscles, causing problems thr
defaultoughout the body. Therefore all 
defaulttreatment must be
default 
defaultmultidisciplinary, 
defaultholistic and treat patients 
defaultdepending upon
default their individual experience of the condition’s progression.
default7.3
default              
defaultThe Specialist 
defaultMDT will be able to respond to the progressive and complex nature
default of a patients
default’ 
defaultindividual needs 
defaultfrom a broader and holistic understanding
default in a timely and proactive way only if the links to local education, health and social care services are sufficient.
default7.4
default              
defaultCurrent Specialist MDTs are under a great deal of strain, and clinical time for patients is very low. Only with a sufficient number of specialised clinicians and nurses will people and families living with DMD be given the time and information they need.
default&#xa0;
default8. defaultObesity as a contributory factor to conditions including diabetes, heart failure and coronary heart disease and how it might be addresseddefault8.1 
default              
defaultObesity is a problem in DMD d
defaultue to the lack of exercise and s
defaultteroid use.
default8.2 
default              
defaultA 
defaultspecialist d
defaultietician
default must be a part of a Specialist MDT.
default8.3 
default              
defaultThis dietician must link with the rest of the MDT, local services and provide specialist information depending on the steroid use of the patient and the individual circumstances.
default&#xa0;
default9. defaultCurrent examples of effective integration of services across health, social care and other services which treat and manage long-term conditionsdefault9.1 
default              
defaultCentres of Excellence
default such as GOSH and Newcastle already link local services together in a ‘hub-and-spoke model’
default.
default9.2
default              
default Often patients and families cannot get coordinated and integrated care locally without a hub or care advisor organising their care. Families o
defaultften have
default to re-explain the condition again an
defaultd again to numerous clinicians.
default9.3
default              
default 
defaultNeuromuscular 
defaultCare Advisors lie at the heart of integrating services across health, social care and other services. They must 
defaulttie together the multitude of services required when living with DMD.
default9.4 
default              
defaultGiven that DMD is symptomatic at a
default young age and the speed of progression of the disease requires educatio
defaultn, health and social care to work together around the patient, Action Duchenne feels th
defaultat those living with DMD must have Care Plans which include all of these aspects and MDT’s must have strong links to local education, health and social care services
default.
default&#xa0;
default10. defaultThe implications of an ageing population for the prevalence and type of long term conditions, together with evidence about the extent to which existing services will have the capacity to meet future demanddefault10.1 
default              
defaultThe Duchenne population in Denmark has almost doubled since 1990, the average age has risen from 14 to 24 and people with DMD are now living into their late 40s. The number of 
defaultpeople living with DMD will increase as standards of care improve and treatments come to market.
default10.2 
default              
defaultExisting services, especially in terms of specialist centres, are already 
defaultunder strain. These existing services must be planned long term, with the MDT in each region being formally developed to cope with the increase in population.
default10.3 
default              
defaultAs drugs 
defaultfor DMD 
defaultare developed, access to trials and monitoring of th
defaulteir efficacy can only be done by specialist MDTs. Therefore, it is vital MDTs in each region are set up swiftly, as set out in the service specification, and trials are accessible no matter where in the UK the patients live.

default 
defaultFamilies break ups and 
defaultdepression are also much more likely in families living with DMD. A
defaultdequate
default 
defaultpsycho-social care
default must be provided from diagnosis

defaultwith proper information and follow up
default. 
default11.3

default 
defaultfor appropriate carers
default on families is very large. Families must be supported and the progressive nature of the disease must be understood and planned for. Long term decisions must be made, with the families given a clear plan to lessen the 
defaultpossibility

defaultissues
default.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default 
defaultPatient counselling

defaultProblems like bullying

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAction Duchenne anticipates that the new Education, Health and Care plans will be wanted by all parents. Inconsistencies in providing them could lead to 
defaultanxiety among parents and representation will be needed for assessments
