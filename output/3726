defaultWritten evidence from defaultMerseyside Cycling Campaign adefaultnd defaultWirral Pedestrians' Association (CYS0017)default&#xa0;defaultProposals to eradicate fatal and serious injuries to Merseyside pedestrians and cyclistsdefault&#xa0;
defaultMerseyside is not a safe place for children or adults to walk or cycle 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe reason is the danger to children and adults from motor vehicles, which is particularly bad in Merseyside. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAre serious injuries to pedestrians and cyclist acceptable?defaultAround 300 Merseyside children are injured by motor vehicles each year, as pedestria
defaultns or cyclists.  That is nearly one each day.  Some 60 of these injuries to children are classed as serious - more than one each week.  In addition, 800 adult pedestrians or cyclists are injured every year.  
default&#xa0;
defaultFor children injured by dangerous dogs, gang v
defaultiolence, parental abuse or sexual abuse, society does not regard any number other than zero as acceptable - and yet 300 children injured by motor vehicles 
defaultattracts
default little attention.  
default&#xa0;
defaultMany road safety professionals now argue for a Vision Zero approach - w
defaulthere the only acceptable number of fatalities or serious injuries is zero.  This has driven the Swedish road safety programme for some time [1], is supported by the OECD [2], and is the basis of London's 2013 
defaultSafe Streets
default plan [3].  
default&#xa0;
defaultA key part of Vision 
defaultZero is a Safe System approach where it is recognised that all road users - pedestrians, cyclists and motor vehicle drivers - will make mistakes from time to time, and provision is made to minimise the consequences of these mistakes. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat are the health defaultimpacts of unconstrained road dangers in Merseyside?default 
default
default 
defaultthe
default 2012 pedestrian casualty rate (deaths or serious injuries) was the worst in Great Britain [note 4]
default 
default
default 
defaultthe
default 2012 cyclist total of deaths or serious injuries was at a 16-year high [note 5]
default 
default
default 52% of 
defaultdeaths or serious road injuries in Merseyside occur in pedestrians or cyclists [note 6]

defaultan

default 
default
default 
defaultpoor

default&#xa0;
defaultAction neededdefaultEvery day, as pedestrians and cyclists, we see dangers to vulnerable road users that are not being addressed.  When these dangers have been reported to 
defaultthose in authority, responses have too often shown indifference, prevarication and inaction.  Yet simple solutions exist that are far more straightforward than providing 24-hour care to just one of the pedestrians or cyclists rendered brain-damaged or para
defaultplegic by motor vehicles.  
default&#xa0;
defaultWe therefore present a range of measures that, had they been already implemented, would have avoided many deaths and much ill health.  Continued inaction in the face of this epidemic on our roads can only result in further avoi
defaultdable deaths and disability.  We do not think that this is acceptable.
