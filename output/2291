[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. Transparency of institutional investors' holdings of equity and debt securities in fossil fuel companies[bold]. At the moment, pension funds, asset management firms and other institutional investors are not obliged to disclose information about their investments to the public, or even their own members. This must change to enable greater public scrutiny of the investment practices of the biggest investors.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3. More regulation to achieve greater transparency of banks lending and investment banking activities[bold]. At the moment, researching the activities of banks is fraught with difficulty. Without access to expensive propriety databases, most people are currently unable to see what their bank is 
[normal]investing in. Government needs to act to force banks to disclose more about their specific investments in the fossil fuel sector.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. Reform of listing criteria[bold] is one example of a new regulatory measure
[normal] that the government should introduce. 
[normal]At the moment, the UK's listing authority, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is charged only with ensuring that companies’ corporate governance and reporting meets certain standards before allowing them to list on the London Stock Exchange. Listing rules should be expanded to include social, environmental and climate criteria to prevent firms with dubious records from using London as a base to raise money for their destructive activities.

[normal]In failing to regulate in this way, the UK is missing out on the opportunity to create a thriving renewables sector. In contrast, the renewables sector in California, China, Demark, Germany and Spain has taken root from a mix of favourable regulation, including feed-in tariffs and other subsidies that include small-scale producers, renewables targets and infant industry protection. The UK is lagging behind other countries in the transition to a high-tech low-carbon energy system and economy. Increased regulation for extractives companies and financial institutions is one of the first steps we need to take to make a start on this transition.
