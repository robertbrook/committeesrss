\nChair: Good afternoon.  You are all welcome to this\n sixth evidence session on local government procurement\n.  \nFor our records, could you say who you are and the organisations you represent?\nMark Wardman: My n\name is Mark \nWardman\n.  I am a Senior M\nanager in the information and analysis group at the Audit Commission.\nAlan Bryce: I am Alan Bryce, Head of Counter-F\nraud for the Audit Commission.\nKeith Davis: I am Keith Davis, Director of Cabinet Office and Cross-Government S\ntudies at the National Audit Office.\nQ387 &#xa0; \nChair: \nThank you very much for coming to give evidence\n.  \nIn taki\nng evidence, we have talked to quite a few local authorities.  I suppose the feeling always is that the ones who come to give evidence and speak to you are those who are doing things best, and that is why they want to tell you about it.  How do we get a real feel about whether local authorities in general are using best practice in the area of\n procurement\n?\nMark Wardman: There is a slight problem for the Audit Commission now in answering a question like that, because we no longer have the route into understanding auditor assessments and judgments that perhaps we did in the past.  I have come along today in part because I have done some work recently with the Local Government Association, which \nlooked at contract management in councils, and from that I have picked up some evidence of their procurement practice, too.  \nQ388 &#xa0; \nChair: But don’t they talk to the people who are doing things best as well?  They also talk to the authorities who are doing things best.\nMark Wardman: The Local Government Association?\nChair: Yes.\nMark Wardman: In the case of that particular piece of work, we were talking to councils that we felt had shown good practice in that area, that is true, but the councils were keen to explain how they had gone on a journey, overcome some of the barriers to poor procurement and contract management and improved.\nQ389 &#xa0; \nChair: If the Audit Commission has not got the ability now, has the National Audit Office taken over so it can give us all the information?\nKeith Davis: I fear that my answer may slightly frustrate the Committee’s question on this one as well.  I am here as one of the authors of the recent National Audit Office work on central Government contracting.  There are a lot of lessons and principles we can draw out from our experience of looking at that which are equally relevant to local government.  \nOn your specific question, one of the keys perhaps is transparency.  It was certainly a big theme of the work we did on central Government that we need a much better understanding of who is spending what, what revenue a contractor is getting, what level of profit a contractor is getting and what level of performance is being delivered on individual contracts.  That might be one of the keys to getting a better understanding of what is happening in the local government landscape.\nQ390 &#xa0; \nChair: But as soon as we got anywhere near those sorts of issues the contractors say it is a matter of commercial confidentiality and they cannot release the information because their competitors will have an immediate advantage in seeing what they are doing.  Can you have commercial confidentiality but somehow get a release of useful information in these matters?\nKeith Davis: You can.  That was not our recent experience.  One of the reports we published a couple of weeks ago was based on the portfolio of work that Serco, Capita, G4S and \nAtos\n do across the public sector.  We engaged with them and asked them for information on revenue broken down by different public sector clients.  We asked them for information on their profit, and whether they have open book accounting.  We even cheekily \nasked \nwhether they paid \nUK\n tax.  In all cases, we got pretty comprehensive answers.\nQ391 &#xa0; \nChair: Answers to you.\nKeith Davis: Yes, and we were able to put the answers and data they gave us into our published report.  It is all in here.  Contractors might often be willing to go a lot further with this than we sometimes think.\nMark Wardman: It is clear that councils have been on a journey on procurement over the last 10 to 15 years.  There has been a huge effort to improve guidance for councils on procurement, and a growth in shared services and contracting out.  It would be surprising if councils were not improving in this area in that context, but they vary enormously.  They \nhave been procuring goods and services for a very long time—as long as they have been in existence—and the fact they have such a wide variety of contracts within each council means there will be variable practice across the piece.  My sense is that it is probably improving, but some will be much better at it than others.\nQ392 &#xa0; \nChair: As a general comment, all local authorities are under enormous pressure to be as efficient as possible and try to make savings on their procurement.  \nOn the other hand\n, the issue of social value is probably coming to the fore in a way it was not 10 years ago.  How do local authorities deal with the potential conflict between getting prices down but also adding social value to contracts at the same time?\nMark Wardman: You are alluding to a tension in council procurement, and that existed before the financial crisis and the recent austerity programme to reduce their income.  Councils have always had to balance aggregating their demand to get the lowest possible price through economies of scale and fostering a healthy local economy through their procurement.  \nFrom the latest research with the Local Government Association on contract management, I am picking up the fact that, of the various social value areas in which councils are interested, they are particularly interested in economic regeneration—perhaps prioritising that over environmental regeneration.  For example, through their procurement and contract management they are looking for suppliers who provide apprenticeships for local people, and using local firms in their supply chain, perhaps bringing other things from contractors where they have had difficulty.  I think \nBirmingham\n persuaded the directors of some companies to act as school governors, for example.  They are tying in some of the social value they want in their area to economic regeneration in particular in their contracts.\nQ393 &#xa0; \nJames Morris: Both the Audit Commission and the National Audit Office have pointed to the value of collaboration between local authorities.  How effective do you think local government is being in collaborating on procurement?\nKeith Davis: We did some joint work with the Audit Commission back in 2010 where we made general comments about the scope to go further with collaboration.  For our part, we have not looked at local authorities in any way since.  It is not part of our remit.  \nThe one thing we have looked at quite recently is police procurement, and certainly we argued there that there were pretty significant missed opportunities around collaboration.  Police forces were taking a too localised approach.  About half of them still had their own dedicated procurement teams; there were lots of barriers to collaboration around police forces wanting their own particular specification for a uniform or boot and that was getting in the way.  If you could move to a place where there is a standard specification for uniforms, to use that example, they would be much more effective in being able to get the benefits of aggregating demand.\nMark Wardman: \nI\n absolutely agree. That report did set out how standard specifications, economies of scale and fewer tenders would lead to reduced admin costs.  Those things showed that aggregating your demand in a market works.  \nThere is an example in the contract management report which draws on the experience of London councils, led by the London Borough of Camden.  It shows how sharing information can make a really big difference.  They asked councils how much they were spending on IT procurement, broadly from the same supplier, and found, to everyone’s surprise, how much \nvariation there was.  Using that information and given that transparency, they were able to negotiate with the supplier, approaching a saving of £2.5 million in one year.  Given the success of that initiative, the LGA now wants to roll that out nationwide, or certainly in England.\nQ394 &#xa0; \nJames Morris: One of the tensions that has come out in evidence in our inquiry is about whether the Government should mandate in some way a centralised way of local government procuring services, or whether local autonomy should still be an important factor.  What is your view, Mr \nWardman\n?\nMark Wardman: Representing the Audit Commission, I think \nmandation\n is an issue for the Government rather than us.\nQ395 &#xa0; \nJames Morris: Do you think it would enhance the savings which you are pointing to, in terms of collaboration, if there was to be a mandate that said, “We’re going to move towards a more centralised procurement process”, on the basis of the savings your reports have identified?\nMark Wardman: I preface my response by saying that councils need to be very clear\n why they do not collaborate\n.  \nThey\n need to be sure they are getting better value than would be the case, certainly for things like IT, stationery, vehicles, possibly travel and subsistence and consultants, but they could argue that it depends on the scope of \nmandation\n and the consequences of failing to comply.  There might be very local and specific issues related to contracted-out care for some very vulnerable individuals, for example looked-after children.  We need to be careful.  \nG\niven the range of services\n councils provide, \nmandation\n might be\n seen by them as a r\nather crude weapon, if that is the right expression, to make sure \nthey get the\n best possible price. They will\n argue,\n \nwith some justification\n, that they need to protect their local requirements and understand their local objectives, but that is not to say \neveryone shoul\nd go off and do their own thing.  Centralised procurement carries powerful weight.\nQ396 &#xa0; \nJames Morris: Mr Davis, what do you think about that idea?\nKeith Davis: It would not be our place to say yes or no to \nmandation\n in local government.\nQ397 &#xa0; \nJames Morris: In principle, in terms of trying to achieve the objective of collaboration, do you think it needs to be more than just a good idea for local authorities, police authorities or whoever to collaborate, and there needs to be some other mechanism put in place to make sure that happens?\nKeith Davis: It is certainly the case that in central Government there have been some benefits from \nmandation\n.  \nThe idea of the Cabinet Office mandat\ning the main central Government Departments to buy through particular routes has led to \nsavings\n.  \nIf you are weighing up whether\n or not to mandate\n, \nas Mark hinted at, \nthere is a complicated set of factors to take into account\n when you go into local government, not least local accountability and what it means.  \nThere is also the behavioural side of it.  As human beings, \ni\nf we are forced to do something\n that may not\n always get the best response from us; if we are persuaded to do something because we see some data that show us\n it is bet\nter value for money to go down this rather \nthan that route, we will probably buy in more to collaboration as a principle, so quite a subtle judg\nment \nis \nto be made.\nQ398 &#xa0; \nJames Morris: Mr Bryce, presumably this does not cover your area.\nAlan Bryce: It does not cover my area of expertise.\nQ399 &#xa0; \nChair: While \nmandation\n to collaborate may not always be right and there will be real problems around it, trying to ensure best practice is passed on to other authorities must, surely, always be right.  How are you going to do that? The Audit Commission is no longer there to do it.  I am not quite sure what the National Audit Office will be doing in this area, so who is going to do it?\nKeith Davis: \nI can answer\n a little bit about what the National Audit Office is going to be doing.  \nWe are \npicking up some aspects of the Audit Commission role, as you know, one of which is around the code of audit practice, but perhaps more relevantly here are some aspects of the national studies that the Audit Commission does.  \nWe will b\ne doing a small number of those each year.  They will not be about making judg\nments on individual local authorities; \nthey will be about looking across the whole picture and explicitly drawing out good practice as a \nvehicle for di\nsseminating it.  We will be able to make a contribution.  Clearly, we are not the only actors in this space; there are a\n number of\n other parties, which Mark can probably talk about better than I can, who are well placed to do some of this.\nMark Wardman: T\nhe L\nocal Government Association \ncomes to mind as an organisation that will collect good practice, but I suppose your question points to the fact \nthat one of the previous roles for the Audit Commission’s national studies was to \ncollate information centrally about what auditors\n and earlier performance specialists had found.  It could use that\n not only \nto map the terrain—\nwhat\n we felt was the variability of performance—but also \nhig\nhlight good practice.  It was a\n means of spreading good pract\nice.  With us going, we would like to see some means of collating the assessments that \nauditors ma\nke in an easily understandable and digestible way.\nQ400 &#xa0; \nChair: That is not a role for the National Audit Office, is it?\nKeith Davis: We do not have current plans to do exactly that, as far as I understand.  I am not close to our group that is taking in parts of the Audit Commission work.  I work in a team that leads on work around the Cabinet Office and central Government agenda, but I am not aware of anything there.\nQ401 &#xa0; \nChair: If I were to ask you whether the National Audit Office was going to have a proper ongoing dialogue with the LGA about how to work together on this area, what would you say?\nKeith Davis: I am certain that is the case.  We already have a significant dialogue with the Local Government Association and \nlots of other parties around\n local government, and I am certain that will include this as a topic.\nQ402 &#xa0; \nMrs Glindon: Mr \nWardman\n, earlier you said that councillors \nhad been on a journey over the last\n 10 years on procurement, but \nboth your organisations have been re\nally damning about the lack of skills in central \nGovernment \nand local government to manage complex procurement.  \nWhat\n measures should the Government and \nthe local government sector as well be taking to \naddress this deficit in skills?\nMark Wardman: What measures should local government be taking?\nQ403 &#xa0; \nMrs Glindon: At both national \nGovernment \nand local government level.\nMark Wardman: \nLocal government can draw on a range\n of sources to help them improve their procurement skills, but,\n going\n back to my earlier point, \nthere will be\n variable practice.  For example, some small district councils might find it\n hard to recruit the specia\nlist procurement expertise \nthey would need\n.  Broadly, I suppose you can define this.  I know y\nou\n will hear from others about what that skill would involve, but, from our point of view, based on our past work,\n it is certainly a commercial outlook\n.  \nUnderstanding procurement means understanding\n costs, prices, supplier business models, and the creation of an\n effective business case t\nhat looks at costs and benefits of different options.  \nIt \nis about understanding markets.\nBased on my own experience—I \ncannot give you quantitative data\n—I know that not all councils have exactly the same levels of skills in those areas.  It would be \ninteresting to see whether local government could draw on people with expertise as and when they need\ned\n it\n.  The ways they can do that are: they can employ people with a commercial or procurement background; they can\n use consultants from time to time, althoug\nh, from the work we did recently,\n \nthey have different views about the value of consultants, certainly in contract management; they can bring people in to train their staff, but i\nt may well be they just need to bring in some other organisation tha\nt might provide specialist help when it is needed.  I am not saying I know what that is.\nQ404 &#xa0; \nMrs Glindon: How could national Government move this along? We are talking about a time of cuts in local council budgets, and making use of consultants and extra training would be very onerous.  While it is about how to get the best procurement, the culture is changing because of what has been forced on to councils.  Is there anything the Government can do to provide guidance or help?\nMark Wardman: If you take the view, as I would\n, that the principl\nes of good procurement and \ncontract management apply\n probably not just across all parts of the public sector but more widely,\n initiatives like the Commissioning Aca\ndemy, run by the Cabinet Office, mean that a body of expertise is developing on which councils might be able to draw.  \nA\nnecdotally, I know that some councils have spoken to the Cabinet Office about that.  I am not party to those discussions; \nI do not know what has taken place, but \nit seems to me there is a line of communication opening up that could be quite \nuseful.\nQ405 &#xa0; \nMrs Glindon: Do you know how much the lack of skills is costing the taxpayer locally or nationally?\nMark Wardman: \nI do not think I would be willi\nng to put a figure on it.  Lack of skills means you are much more likely to encounter the risks that good procurement seeks to manage, essentially buying \nthe wrong things\n,\n or \nbuying \nthe right things \nat the wrong price, or buying them at the right price but for the wrong level of quality.  It might be too high a \nquality, \ndepending on your needs.  \nAll those so\nrts of risks could be mitigated by having access to expertise.\nKeith Davis: That is right.  It is \nvery dif\nficult to get an overall sense of how much lack of skills might cost.  There are some case examples from things that have\n gone wrong in contracts\n.  \nI agree with Mark that the key area where there is a significant \nskill \nshortfall is \ncontract management.  The problems that the Ministry of Justice has had with its electronic monitoring contracts are well publicised.  We know that the cost \nhas run into tens of millions of pounds\n.  \nT\nhe Ministry of Justice has not yet settled with the two contractors, but there will certainly be a very significant cost to the taxpayer.  It may well be that the contractors\n pay\n back\n some or \nall of that money, but it \nshow\ns the potential scale or cost of not necessarily having the right contract management skills.\nChair: You were talking about your discussions with \nAtos\n, G4S and Serco.  You were probably trying to find out how not to do things in terms of contracts, but we will move on.\nQ406 &#xa0; \nMark Pawsey: I want to ask about how effective \nlocal authorities are at managing contracts, \nin particular how effective they are at managing risk.  One of the risks to local authorities in the running of contracts is fraud.  Mr Bryce, I am not sure we have heard from you yet.  Could you tell us your view on how effective \nlocal authoritie\ns are at managing risk, and the risk of fraud occurring in contracts in which they are involved?\nAlan Bryce: S\npeaki\nng from the evidence base that the commission collects, Mark made the point that our evidence base has changed.  W\ne do collect data on all fraud com\nmitted against local government and publish this in our annual report \nProtecting\n the\n Public Purse\n.  \nWe published the 2013 version only a couple of weeks ago.  I suggest it has some very\n intere\nsting messages in relation to how we interpret the fraud detection activities, compared with the total amount of fraud and the risks out there.  \nFor example, in 2013\n all of local government\n—local government as a whole submits the data—203 cases of procurement fraud to a value of £1.9\n&#xa0;\nmillion were detected.  To put that into context, nationally all the fraud detected and committed against local government amounted to 107,000 cases, so we are talking about 0\n.2%\n.  \nThat is probably not unexpected in terms of the \ncases, because generally procurement frauds tend to be higher value cases but of lower volume compared with the traditional cases of fraud that local government face.\nSome interesting trend data are starting to emerge.  If I take you back to 2011, there were 145 cases of detected procurement fraud, so that is a 40% increase in only a couple of \nyears\n.  \nThat would tend to indicate \na greater focus on this issue, which many organisations such as the Commission have been encouraging, but, given the potential scale of loss due to procurement fraud, it would indicate there is still some distance to go.  A number of reasons sit behind that.  \nThe most common explanation we have seen from local government investigators tends to fall around the specific problems of trying to identify and investigate \nprocurement fraud\n itself.  It is generally far more complex in more traditional areas such as housing benefit fraud.  Many of the\n traditional\n techniques, for example data matching and data analytics, \nd\no not apply,\n and that\n puts a lot of emphasis particularly on \nwhistleblowing\n initially to identify and investigate those frauds, and that \nstart\ns\n to create issues around capa\nbility.  Fifteen or 20 years ago most large internal audit teams in local government would have a contract audit\n specialist, for example\n.  \nVery few have that now, so do they necessarily\n have the capability to tackle this type of fraud and investigate it properly?\nThere is also a\nn issue of capacity\n in relation to tackling procurement fraud, partic\nularly going forward.  Right now, many of the smaller local government bodies rely on the investigative capacity they already have in dealing with housing benefit fraud investigations.  It is an in-house team, but not entirely; some have corporate fraud teams and some have contract audit specialists.  Going forward, even though there are relatively few cases of detected fraud in relation to procurement that we are seeing, compared with the\n totality\n,\n \nthe capacity \nof \nlocal government to investigate this type of fraud\n is likely to fall away consid\nerably with the advent of the single fraud investigation service next year.\nQ407 &#xa0; \nMark Pawsey: Were the figures you cited cases identified by the local authorities themselves or by auditors?\nAlan Bryce: It would be a mix of all fraud detected.  The other thing that might be of interest to the Committee—the data bring this out quite clearly—is that, if we rewind a couple of years, the average value of the detected fraud case committed against local government was just over £100,000 per case.  If we go forward two years, it is just under £10,000.\nQ408 &#xa0; \nMark Pawsey: What do we deduce from that?\nAlan Bryce: I would suspect that a significant proportion of this is due to the fact we are now starting to see the impact, from a couple of years ago, of one particular type of procurement fraud arising from changes to bank mandate details, which the Committee might well be aware of, and the way in which the transparency agenda and tackling corruption have helped facilitate fraudsters to use publicly-available information to commit fraud.  I suggest that local government is responding very well by putting in place the prevention arrangements to stop those types of fraud happening now.\nQ409 &#xa0; \nMark Pawsey: You are saying there are more cases but on average each case is significantly smaller in size, and therefore the total amount of fraud committed against local authority procurement is less than it was previously?\nAlan Bryce: Not committed but detected.\nQ410 &#xa0; \nMark Pawsey: Are local bodies good at detecting fraud?  I suppose that the judgment call I am asking you to make is how much people are getting away with.\nAlan Bryce: At the start, I \nalluded\n to the fact that \ndetecting this \ntype of fraud is very difficult.  Short of \nwhistleblowing\n, it is very hard to find these types of fraud\n, despite the \nfact that there has been a lot of guidance about good practice to\n assist authorities\n.  \nThere is no academi\ncally robust and statistically significant estimate of the scale of procurement fraud against local government.  An estimate has been made by the National Fraud Authority.  It estimates that £876 million is the likely scale of risk of annual fraud loss in local government procurement.  \nTherefore, by comparison\n £1.9 million of detection in total would appear very small, but a\n couple of points\n are to be made here.  \nOne is that it suggests that even more can be done by local government.  When I talked about the amount detected\n in one year, that could be\n running back several years.  Therefore, the £1.9 million of detected fraud in local government in the last year is not just the total amount committed in that year.  However, when the National Fraud Authority talks about the total annual loss, that is just for one year, so it suggests that in terms of value an awful lot more can be done.\nI would put down a marker in respect of that \nestimate\n.  That estimate is based\n on an analysi\ns of procurement fraud in the MO\nD\n, not local government.  Without being an expert in procurement in the MOD, I do not know how directly comparable that is with the fraud prevention arrangements that local government have, so it might be more of an indicator at the top level, but certainly it is difficult to say how true a reflection that is.\nQ411 &#xa0; \nMark Pawsey: In terms of management of risk\n, what steps could local authorities take\n to improve their performance\n?\nAlan Bryce: \nFraud can happen anywhere within the process of procur\nement.  Maybe I should explain that every single case of fraud committed against local government valued at over £10,000 crosses my desk.  Most of the fraud cases being detected tend to be at\n the contract implementation stage\n.  \nThere are important \nissues more generally about the controls in place to prevent and detect fraud, for example \ntraditional issues around segregation of duties\n.  \nWe have seen an \nups\nurge in the number of cases where the absence of supervisory controls and segregation of duties has enabled these \nfraud\ns to occur.  A review of the controls fundamental to preventing and detecting fraud is required.  N\not all local authorities\n, as part of their review of controls more generally, are necessarily considering \nthe key controls to prevent a\nnd detect fraud, and I would encourage them to do so.\nT\nhe\n pre-tendering side of fraud risk is even more problematic.  In very few of the cases \nwe have seen \ndoes detection\n occu\nr at that stage, which\n suggest\ns\n that\n,\n if there is to be a proportionate response \nto tackling this type of fraud, the deterrence aspect probably needs to be considered much more widely.  \nI can suggest a couple of ways to aid local authority investigations.  One is around \nwhistleblowing\n.  The other one, which I am told about consistently by colleagues who are investigating these cases, is that often they feel stymied b\ny the difficulty of ob\ntaining access to information from the organisations providing the service.  This has prevented many of the fraud investigations from proceeding.  As a result, \nI understand t\nhat many councils often treat what we would probably consider to be procurement fraud as a \ncase of weak contract managemen\nt.  Our message has always been to treat fraud as fraud.  That is perhaps changing a little, but there is still that within the system.\nQ412 &#xa0; \nMark Pawsey: When that fraud occurs, that causes reputational damage to the body involved.  The other two types of fraud that the Audit Commission identified were: the dangers of \nsupplier \ninsolvency, where too onerous a contract may push the supplier out of business, and service failure.  All of that damages the reputation of the procuring body, in this case the local council.  We have heard quite extensively from Mr Bryce about fraud, but, on those other two risks, are councils sufficiently adept at managing risk, picking up the point made by Mrs\n&#xa0;\nGlindon\n about whether they have the skills to manage it?\nMark Wardman: In some cases, the councils we spoke to that have developed collaborative arrangements with suppliers, for example Solihull, have brought other councils into those arrangements so they can take advantage of the savings.  Not just Solihull but others in that report are very alive to the idea \nof supply fai\nlure.  \nThere have been some very high-profile failures, not least in social care, so an organisation like Trafford will, as part of its\n annual market management\n,\n have extensi\nve dialogue with \ncouncils.  That produces some benefits to them when they come to the vexed question about whether the supplier\n \ncan share their \npain as well a\ns the gains, hopefully, in good times.  \nThey have managed to negotiate \nthat, because they understand their supplier market and the business models of different suppliers.  Councils are increasingly \nalive to the idea that you can ask too much of your suppliers.\nQ413 &#xa0; \nMark Pawsey: To take the example you have just given, does pressure on budgets encourage councils to be at greater risk than they might otherwise be in terms of to whom they give a contract?  Are they less diligent or cautious in letting a contract because they are under pressure to deliver at a lower price?\nMark Wardman: \nI cannot give you a picture of what is going on, but\n that has to be a risk.  One point I wanted to make earlier, which is also relevant to this point and also to fraud, is that w\ne have just published a report called \nTough Times\n.  \nTh\nat shows that councils are broadly managing within their budgets and set managed budgets, but th\ney are doing tha\nt primarily by making savings.  About half of the savings councils are having to make are by reducing\n staff numbers\n.  \nFi\ngures from the ONS suggest that since 2009\n councils ha\nve shed about 19% of their full-time equivalent headcount.  In that case\n the question is\n: who are they letting go?  In the same way as the old days, if councils contract out their \nse\nrvice and technical expertise along with the contract, they find that perhaps they are at a loss when it comes to contract management, change of control or \nre-letting the contract\n.  \nThere is an issue here a\nbout skills which it is important for councils to address.  They are having to make savings and predominantly they are doing it by letting people go as well as outsourcing contracts.  Those two things together present a risk for them if they are not on top of it.\nQ414 &#xa0; \nDavid Heyes: Mr Bryce has anticipated the line of questioning I was going to pursue on fraud in the very comprehensive and helpful responses we have had so far.  You briefly mentioned whistleblowers.  Would you say that \nwhistleblowing\n is the main source of identification of fraud? What proportion is it?\nAlan Bryce: I would not have the specific statistics.\nQ415 &#xa0; \nDavid Heyes: Give us a feel for it.\nAlan Bryce: It is probably the single most common way of identifying procurement fraud.\nQ416 &#xa0; \nDavid Heyes: That poses two obvious questions.  What can we do to make that more likely?  How can we be more supportive of potential whistleblowers to create a more open environment?  What other things should councils be doing to open up other sources of identification of fraud?\nAlan Bryce: As to \nwhistleblowing\n, this really comes down to a fundamental issue in terms of who is doing the \nwhistleblowing\n.  \nAs we have recognised in other areas,\n it is important to ensure that the organisations you deal with and the staff involved, who will be the people who blow the whistle, are aware, in a local government context, of to whom they can blow the whistle, not just in their own organisation but the local authorities concerned.  I know that as part of contract arrangements some consideration is often given to what the \nwhistleblowing\n arrangements of the provider organisation are, but I think we could go a lot further than that.\nIn the end, the danger of that approach is ticking a box that virtually everybody will be able to tick—“I have some \nwhistleblowing\n arrangements, or a policy as such.” Any organisation would be able to say that.  What is more important is the extent to which that is embedded; the culture of staff in a private sector organisation, of which care homes are a very good example; and whether those providing the care—this goes further than fraud—would feel confident to blow the whistle to the council rather than their own organisation if they saw something of concern, and there are detrimental aspects to this for them individually.  Strengthening the requirement around that and putting greater emphasis on assurance around the \nwhistleblowing\n arrangements in provider organisations would be very helpful.\nThis Committee might not have had the chan\nce to consider it yet, but the leading \nwhistleblowing\n charity, Public Concern at Work, published its \nWhistleblowing\n Commission report last week.  T\nhey make a number \nof very helpful recommendations that address that specific point, which is wider than just fraud, and include a \ncode of practic\ne.  That is something \nprivat\ne bodies might want to consider in the future.\nKeith Davis: That \nechoes wh\nat we said about \nwhistleblowing\n in our report a couple of weeks ago.  We framed it in terms of public sector procuring authorities seeing it very much as part of the dialogue they are having with contractors, saying to them, “If you want to \ndo business with us, we want to see your \nwhistleblowing\n policy; we want to\n understand how that works in practice; we want you to convince us that there is a\n culture within the organisation where \nwhistl\neblowing\n is not trampled down\n and is genuinely encouraged.\n”  \nWe would look almost for third-party reviews of \nwhistleblowing\n policies to give public sector customers \nextra confide\nnce in these contractors.  I agree with everything Alan said.  \nW\nhistleblowing\n is absolutely crucial\n to combating fraud.\nQ417 &#xa0; \nDavid Heyes: There is perhaps an irony in this.  If you depend so heavily on \nwhistleblowing\n to identify fraud, you almost depend on the fraud taking place for the \nwhistleblowing\n to be effective.  What \nother things should be happening to nip the fraud in the bud before we become so dependent on whistleblowers?\nAlan Bryce: There are other very effective\n techniques\n to identify fraud.  I go back to my earlier response.  Probably the \none consideration we really should be \ngiving thought to is around deterrence.  \nThere is relatively little\n deterrence from the perspective of fraud currently in the system, by which I mean that to have effective deterrence you must have a\n reasonable capaci\nty to identify and detect fraud initially;\n and\n, more importantly, there should be an investigator who would be able to investigate this and the local authority\n would take action appropriately, including\n potentially criminal sanction.\nLooking at the data we have right now on detection, if an organisation really wanted and was encouraged to attempt some form of procurement fraud, currently\n th\nere is a very good chance that they would not be identified.  One gets back to the point made earlier in the Committee.  How do we start to address the capacity and\n capability\n to investigate this?\n \n Most important\n of all\n, if you are to have deterrence there must be a change of mindset.  \nAs the public sector, we should be \nshouting f\nrom the rooftops every time we find a procurement fraud and celebrate that fact, because the only thing that aids fraudsters if we all\n keep quiet abou\nt it.  There is a cultural aspect here, and, to get to the h\neart of your question\n, tackling fraud culture and the way we talk about the issue would be a \nvery significant step forward.\nQ418 &#xa0; \nChair: Mr Bryce, you made a point about the resistance of service providers to co-operate in this.  H\now can we ensure that more pressure is put on\n them\n to do so?\n  Should things be written into contracts to ensure that service providers do thoroughly co\n&#x2011;\noperate?  Indeed, when somebody \nwhistleblows\n in a private sector organisation should there be a requirement to release that information automatically to the public sector body that is paying for the service\n?\nAlan Bryce: I have not given consideration to the legal requirement to \nwhistleblow\n.  The \nappr\noach we have always taken is to encourage a strong culture.  Consideration could be given to that aspect, and i\nt is such an im\nportant source of information.  On\n the principal issue you asked me about, which is the\n contractual side, if you really want to investigate these matters and tackle it across the sector\n all local authorities\n should be looking for their investigators to have access to the necessary financial information that these provider companies have.\nQ419 &#xa0; \nChair: That would be written into the contract to make it absolutely clear from the beginning.\nAlan Bryce: That would certainly\n be the most effective way.  What I am hearing from the sector is that that is variable.  Some local authorities do require that; others do not, and that lack of consistency means that the local government sector as a whole is finding it more difficult to tackle this type of fraud.\nQ420 &#xa0; \nChair: Would you like to think about the “\nwhistleblowing\n” point and whether something could be written in, and perhaps come back to us on that?\nAlan Bryce: Indeed.\nChair: Thank you all very much for coming and giving evidence to us.\n              \nOral evidence: Local Government Procurement\n, HC \n712\n              \n              \n12\n"
