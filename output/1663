[normal]              
[normal]This 
[normal]submission
[normal] 
[normal]is based
[normal] on the 
[normal]latest
[normal] 
[normal]research on carbon capture and storage
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]CCS
[normal]) 
[normal]and 
[normal]professional opinions of
[normal] experts 
[normal]at
[normal] Imperial College London and the London School of Economics and Political Science.
[normal] It emphasises
[normal] that there is a clear environmental and economic case for 
[normal]a much greater investment
[normal] 
[normal]by the UK public and private sectors 
[normal]in 
[normal]the
[normal] development 
[normal]of CCS
[normal].
[normal]2.
[normal]              
[normal]A
[normal] range of large demonstration projects will be needed by 2020 in order to 
[normal]explore
[normal] whether CCS can be commercially viable at 
[normal]large 
[normal]scale and to minimise the risk of wrong or late investments.
[normal] 
[normal]This will require a 
[normal]number of economic and institutional issu
[normal]es 
[normal]to be addressed 
[normal]relat
[normal]ing 
[normal]to costs
[normal] and
[normal] liabilities, as well as 
[normal]the 
[normal]building 
[normal]of 
[normal]confidence amongst investors and the general public.
[normal]3.
[normal]              
[normal]We welcome and support the
[normal] Government’s approach
[normal] set out in its CCS road
[normal]map
[normal] (DECC, 2012)
[normal], including the emphasis on 
[normal]res
[normal]earch and development in order to reduce
[normal] cost
[normal]s
[normal] reduction
[normal],
[normal] and on the 
[normal]creation of an appropriate 
[normal]regulatory framework. However
[normal],
[normal] progress towards 
[normal]full scale demonstration appears 
[normal]to be falling behind schedule
[normal].
[normal]4.
[normal]              
[normal]Deploying CCS on a large
[normal] scale
[normal] will require 
[normal]policy certainty 
[normal]through a combination of 
[normal]carbon pricing, direct financial support 
[normal]for research and development (particularly for more advanced capture technologies for gas and biomass power plants and for industrial applications)
[normal], manag
[normal]ing
[normal] risk and liabil
[normal]ity, 
[normal]and appropriate regulation, 
[normal]such as 
[normal]mandatory 
[normal]requirements for power plan
[normal]ts.
[normal]5.
[normal]              
[normal]Overall,
[normal] we support the view 
[normal]if the International Energy Agency 
[normal]that CCS will be a critical component in a 
[normal]global 
[normal]portfolio of 
[normal]low-
[normal]carbon energy technologies by 
[normal]2050
[normal]. T
[normal]his
[normal] 
[normal]is 
[normal]a key
[normal] 
[normal]area of 
[normal]climate 
[normal]change 
[normal]mitigation 
[normal]in which
[normal] the UK can
[normal] build on significant expertise and lead the way
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]For this to happen, i
[normal]t 
[normal]is crucial t
[normal]hat t
[normal]he Government
[normal] provide
[normal]s
[normal] clearer CCS policy objectives, including 
[normal]in relation to
[normal] 
[normal]the liability regime an

[normal]The 
[normal]information 
[normal]in this submission
[normal] 
[normal]has been provided from 
[normal]our ongoing
[normal] policy study on 
[normal]the challenges 
[normal]of achieving a
[normal] significant CCS deployment 
[normal]in the European Union 
[normal]by the 2030s
[normal], 
[normal]the result of which we

[normal]in early 2014
[normal].

[normal]              
[normal]CCS is an integrated suite of te
[normal]chnologies 
[normal]which can
[normal] capture around 90 per cent of 
[normal]carbon dioxide 
[normal]emissions from large stationary sources
[normal] (typically power plants or large industrial installations) 
[normal]before it is emitted into the atmosphere. Captured 
[normal]carbon dioxide 
[normal]is then transported to se
[normal]lected site
[normal]s 
[normal]for permanent storage. The three major stages involved in CCS technology are: a) 
[normal]c
[normal]apture; b) 
[normal]t
[normal]ransport; and c) 
[normal]s
[normal]torage
[normal].
[normal]10.
[normal]              
[normal]Capture 
[normal]is the
[normal] separation of 
[normal]carbon dioxide
[normal] from other gases produced at large industrial process facilities
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]such as 
[normal](but not limited to) 
[normal]coal and natural gas power plants, oil
[normal] refineries, natural 
[normal]gas 
[normal]processing 
[normal]plants, steel mills and cement plants. Currently 
[normal]this can be achieved with three alternative technologies
[normal]: 
[normal]p
[normal]ost-combustion; 
[normal]p
[normal]re-combustion
[normal], and
[normal] 
[normal]o
[normal]xy-
[normal]combustion
[normal] 
[normal](

[normal]11.
[normal]              
[normal]Transport
[normal] 
[normal]is
[normal] 
[normal]the transfer
[normal] 
[normal]of the 
[normal]captured 
[normal]carbon dioxide
[normal] 
[normal]from the CCS plant 
[normal]to a selected storage site
[normal], which 
[normal]may
[normal] 
[normal]be located several miles apart
[normal]. 
[normal]Transport can take place
[normal] 
[normal]via pipelines, either 
[normal]o
[normal]nshore 
[normal](
[normal]using 
[normal]a well-established technology 
[normal]already developed
[normal] 
[normal]for enhanced oil recovery) or offshore (currently 
[normal]the subject
[normal] 
[normal]of further research); or
[normal] 
[normal]via 
[normal]shipping 
[normal](
[normal]building on experience 
[normal]from the transport of
[normal] 
[normal]liquefied natural gas
[normal])
[normal].

[normal]2.
[normal]              
[normal]Storage
[normal] is the
[normal] permanent 
[normal]sequestration of 
[normal]carbon dioxide 
[normal]away from the atmosphere. 
[normal]Carbon dioxide 
[normal]is injected into porous rock, either aquifers containing salty water or depleted oil and gas reservoirs. 
[normal]In the UK, storage capacity in oil and gas fields 
[normal]could range from 7.4 to 9.
[normal]9 
[normal]billion tonnes of carbon dioxide. T
[normal]he storage 
[normal]potential
[normal] of saline fields is more uncertain, and could 
[normal]range from
[normal] 6.3 to 62.7 
[normal]billion tonnes of carbon dioxide
[normal] (for f
[normal]urther details 
[normal]see:
[normal] Blunt
[normal], 
[normal]2010
[normal]; Senior CCS Solutions Ltd, 2010
[normal])
[normal].
[normal]13.
[normal]              
[normal]Currently there are about 
[normal]20
[normal] CCS projects in operation
[normal] across the world
[normal], 
[normal]of which only
[normal] one is in Europe (the Sn
[normal]ø
[normal]hvit capture and storage project in Norway). 
[normal]Only eight of these projects
[normal] have been developed at 
[normal]full 
[normal]commercial scale
[normal] (EC, 2013)
[normal].

[normal]              
[normal]An a
[normal]nalysis by 
[normal]the UK Energy Research Centre 
[normal](2013) 
[normal]of
[normal] 
[normal]low-carbon 
[normal]electricity
[normal] potential review
[normal]ed
[normal] 
[normal]nine 
[normal]different scenarios 
[normal]which have been 
[normal]developed by 
[normal]a number of
[normal] institutions (
[normal]inclu
[normal]ding
[normal] the Committee on Climate Change, 
[normal]the Department of Energy and Climate Change 
[normal]and 
[normal]the UK Energy Research Centre)
[normal] 
[normal]to
[normal] model
[normal] 
[normal]ways of meeting
[normal] the UK 
[normal]2050 
[normal]decarbonisation 
[normal]target
[normal] set out in the Climate Change Act 2008
[normal]. 
[normal]These scenarios 
[normal]vary greatly in terms
[normal] of 
[normal]the development of electricity generation capacity using CCS
[normal]. Coal CCS 
[normal]ranges
[normal] from 0 to 38 
[normal]gigawatts (GW)
[normal], gas CCS 
[normal]ranges 
[normal]from 0 to 2.3 GW, co-
[normal]firing 
[normal]is 
[normal]up to 51 GW
[normal],
[normal] and biomass CCS 
[normal]is 
[normal]up to 5 GW.
[normal] Wh
[normal]ile the
[normal] combination of CCS sources (gas, coal, co-fir
[normal]ing or biomass) varies 
[normal]significantly 
[normal]between
[normal] scenario
[normal]s
[normal], all 
[normal]of them 
[normal]include at least some CCS 
[normal]capacity
[normal]. 
[normal]The scenario with the lowest CCS capacity
[normal] 
[normal]estimates at least 12 GW will be in operation by 2050. The 
[normal]scenario with the 
[normal]highest 
[normal]capacity 
[normal]envisages up to 
[normal]57 GW.
[normal] Overall, CCS is expected to 
[normal]meet 
[normal]between 12 
[normal]and 
[normal]37 per cent of total electricity demand in 2050.
[normal]15.
[normal]              
[normal]Nevertheless, considerable work remains to demonstrate CCS at large scale and across 
[normal]all of its stages
[normal],
[normal] both for power generation and for 
[normal]application to 
[normal]other industrial sectors.
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]idespread deployment is unlikely 
[normal]before 
[normal]2020

[normal]and

[normal]5
[normal].0
[normal] GW (LCICG, 2012)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16.
[normal]              
[normal]According to the Low Carbon Innovation Coordination Group (LCICG, 2012)
[normal], the areas of
[normal] innovation
[normal] 
[normal]which could provide
[normal] the biggest 
[normal]potential 
[normal]benefit
[normal]s
[normal] to t
[normal]he UK are (i) deep sea storage 
[normal]and
[normal] related monitoring;
[normal] and (ii) advanced capture development (especially gas and biomass) and demonstration of integrated conversion-capture. There is also a case for broad support for leading ideas with 
[normal]‘
[normal]breakthrough
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]potential
[normal], such a
[normal]s
[normal] novel capture or com
[normal]pression concepts.
[normal]17.
[normal]              
[normal]CCS development in the UK
[normal] could be worth 
[normal]between 
[normal]4
[normal] per cent and 
[normal]6 per cent
[normal] share of the global CCS
[normal] market
[normal],
[normal] with potential cumulative gross 
[normal]added value
[normal] of b
[normal]etween £150
[normal] billion
[normal] 
[normal]and
[normal] 
[normal]£
[normal]750
[normal] billion
[normal] 
[normal]up to 2050, contributing 
[normal]between
[normal] £3 
[normal]billi
[normal]on and
[normal] 
[normal]£
[normal]16
[normal] billion
[normal] to UK GDP 
[normal](LCICG, 2012)
[normal].
[normal]18.
[normal]              
[normal]Innovation 
[normal]also 
[normal]has 
[normal]the potential to drive down the costs (
[normal]excluding
[normal] fuel) of conversion with capture by 
[normal]15 per cent
[normal] by 2025 and 40 per cent
[normal] by 2050
[normal], 
[normal]and to 
[normal]reduce the long-run costs of trans
[normal]port by around 50
[normal] per cent
[normal] and of storage by more than 
[normal]50 per cent
[normal]. 
[normal]Overall, 
[normal]innovation could reduce the costs to the UK of CCS deployment by 
[normal]between 
[normal]£10
[normal] billion and £
[normal]45
[normal] billion up
[normal]to 2050
[normal], and lead to 
[normal]more than 
[normal]£100
[normal] billion in
[normal] systems savings
[normal], 
[normal]by reducing the need f
[normal]or more
[normal] expensive alternatives
[normal] 
[normal](LCICG, 2012)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]19.
[normal]              
[normal]A number of obstacles currently hamper the
[normal] scaling up of CCS. These are mostly associated 
[normal]with the
[normal] 
[normal]economic costs of CCS and related research and development, liability issues associated with storage, policy uncertainty and public and political perception
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal]20.
[normal]              
[normal]Costs.[bold] 
[normal]A fundamental barrier to CCS 
[normal]deployment is cost. Carbon dioxide capture
[normal] 
[normal]is the most expensive phase
[normal], regardless of the process used
[normal] (see 
[normal]Figure
[normal] 
[normal]1)
[normal]. 
[normal]For
[normal] state of the art technology, costs
[normal] currently
[normal] 
[normal]range from £1.1 million per 
[normal]megawatt
[normal] 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]£3.6 million per 
[normal]megawatt
[normal], with gas CCS at the l
[normal]ow end, and biomass applications at the high end (LCICG, 2012)
[normal]. C
[normal]osts are generally high in the early stages of a new technology
[normal], and
[normal] CCS is no different
[normal], b
[normal]ut they could 
[normal]decrease with f
[normal]urther development and refinement of existing technologies and 
[normal]innovative breakthroughs
[normal]. S
[normal]o far
[normal], however,
[normal] the carbon price 
[normal]in the European Union Emissions Trading System 
[normal]has been too low to stimulate 
[normal]sufficient 
[normal]investment in research
[normal],
[normal] development and deployment.

[normal]              
[normal]Policy uncertainty and investors’ [bold]confidence.[bold] 
[normal]W
[normal]hile w
[normal]e welcome the progress that the Government is mak
[normal]ing, 
[normal]as 
[normal]set out in its CCS road
[normal]map
[normal] (DECC, 2012), 
[normal]we are concerned that, following the collapse of the Longannett  project, progress towards a fir
[normal]st demonstration plant appears 
[normal]to be behind
[normal] schedule
[normal]. 
[normal]Currently there are no commercial scale projects which
[normal] can provide
[normal] financiers 
[normal]with 
[normal]confidence in the CCS business model (CCS Cost Reduction Taskforce, 2013). Furthermore, there is significant uncertainty about CCS policy objectives and potential
[normal]ly unintended consequences from the interaction of different policies (for example, policy that accelerates CCS deployment could lower the price of carbon allowances in the 
[normal]European Union Emissions Trading System (
[normal]EU ETS). The level of financial and politi
[normal]cal support for CCS in the medium to long term is also unclear.  Lack of clarity regarding safety regulations and liability issues, as well as national and international storage and transportation, also adds uncertainty to future investment decisions.
[normal] 
[normal]22.
[normal]              
[normal]Liability issues.[bold] 
[normal]C
[normal]ommercial 
[normal]and technical 
[normal]liabilities associated 
[normal]with 
[normal]the 
[normal]CCS value chain
[normal] create 
[normal]large 
[normal]risk
[normal]s
[normal] for the storage providers
[normal]. There is also 
[normal]large 
[normal]uncertainty 
[normal]around
[normal] the extent of liability of the CCS installations and carbon dioxide storage in 
[normal]case of accident and/or leakage. 
[normal]While insurance mechanisms can help 
[normal]to mitigate some 
[normal]of these risk
[normal]s
[normal], s
[normal]ome liabilities are essentially 
[normal]uninsurable
[normal] and would require some form of government guarantee
[normal] (ClimateWise, 2012
[normal])
[normal].
[normal]23.
[normal]              
[normal]Public and political perception.[bold] CCS is viewed 
[normal]by some
[normal] as being incompatible with key elements of 
[normal]a 
[normal]low-carbon economy, as it could lead to potential moral hazard, for example, if used as an excuse for continued investment in unabated fossil fuel infrastructure
[normal] in the short term
[normal]. It is a
[normal]lso associated with centralised energy systems,
[normal] which can be
[normal] perceived as 
[normal]harmful
[normal] 
[normal]to investment in smart grids and interconnection. 
[normal]U
[normal]ntil more is known about the operation of storage facilities, the risk of accidental leakage is likely to be perceived as 
[normal]high.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]24.
[normal]              
[normal]Given the obstacles noted 
[normal]in previous sections
[normal], it 
[normal]is
[normal] essential to provide a package of finance and regulation to 
[normal]advance
[normal] 
[normal]CCS
[normal] from demonstration to deployment at scale. This includes a strong price signal through 
[normal]th
[normal]e 
[normal]European Union Emissions Trading System
[normal], as well as other compl
[normal]e
[normal]mentary policies.
[normal]25.
[normal]              
[normal]First, fo
[normal]r policies to be effective it will be
[normal] crucial to 
[normal]understand where funding support is needed most, and therefore [bold]where[bold] [bold]funding resources[bold] should be prioritised[bold].[bold]26.
[normal]              
[normal]Arguably, funding should target the areas of research, development and deployment that can best deliver reduced costs. These should include next generation technologies that improve plant efficiency and reduce the cost of capture, such as post-combusti
[normal]on carbonate looping and chemical looping (Florin &amp; Fennel, 2010). 
[normal]27.
[normal]              
[normal]A prudent approach 
[normal]would be to 
[normal]prioritise support for gas
[normal] 
[normal]CCS, as opposed to coal
[normal] 
[normal]CCS, 
[normal]since
[normal] the cost per
[normal] 
[normal]kilowatt-hour 
[normal]of ‘clean’ electricity is expected
[normal] to be cheaper (although this 
[normal]will also depend on the relative price of coal and gas) and as lifecycle emissions of gas power plants are significantly lower than for coal (CCC, 2013
[normal]a
[normal]). 
[normal]This would also suit the UK ambition to exploit its shale gas resources, should 
[normal]they prove to be
[normal] comm
[normal]ercially viable and socially
[normal] and environmentally
[normal] acceptable.
[normal]28.
[normal]              
[normal]Biomass 
[normal]e
[normal]nergy with CCS (BECCS) 
[normal]is
[normal] also an important area of research as 
[normal]it
[normal] is one of the most mature ‘negative emissions technologies’ (see for example 
[normal]McGlashan et al., 2012). BECCS should 
[normal]be integrated within the general CCS strategy, and early demonstrations projects should be encouraged. An important potential constraint is the sustainability of the biomass chain, which needs to be thoroughly investigated, including direct and indirect im
[normal]pacts on land use change.
[normal]29.
[normal]              
[normal]CCS funding, which so far has mostly 
[normal]been 
[normal]focused on power plants, should also 
[normal]be used to 
[normal]address 
[normal]more 
[normal]industrial applications. CCS is currently the only technology available to achieve large scale reductions 
[normal]of carbon dioxide emissions 
[normal]in 
[normal]much of 
[normal]the industrial sector. According to the International Energy Agency (2013), almost half of the 
[normal]carbon dioxide 
[normal]that would need to be captured via CCS between 2015 and 2050 
[normal]will be emitted
[normal] from industrial applications. 
[normal]There can be large 
[normal]gains in 
[normal]emissions reduction 
[normal]by
[normal] applying CCS to large 
[normal]energy
[normal] intensive sectors, 
[normal]such as
[normal] iron and steel
[normal] and
[normal] cement 
[normal]production 
[normal]and refineries. Some sectors, like ammonia production and natural gas processing, already routinely apply carbon
[normal] dioxide separation, and in these cases the 
[normal]additional 
[normal]cost of carbon capture could be half those of power plants. There is also scope for reducing operating costs in industries 
[normal]such as
[normal] cement
[normal] production
[normal], where waste heat could be 
[normal]used 
[normal]for carbon dioxide c
[normal]apture 
[normal](Brown et al., 2012).

[normal]from 
[normal]potential 
[normal]sites, 
[normal]especially
[normal] in the North Sea. It 
[normal]w
[normal]ould
[normal] 
[normal]be sensible to prioritise demonstration 
[normal]when it comes to the
[normal] 
[normal]lowest risk 
[normal]options, such as storage in depleted gas fields (Senior CCS Solutions Ltd, 2010). Saline aquifers, especially in the southern North Sea and offshore Scotland 
[normal]may
[normal] 
[normal]offer large potential
[normal] capacities,
[normal] but there is a long lead time and significant risk 
[normal]in assuming their use
[normal] as a specific storage option
[normal], so they
[normal] should be investigated further.
[normal]31.
[normal]              
[normal]Second, o
[normal]nce the key area
[normal]s of investment are identified, 
[normal]appropriate [bold]funding sources and regulat[bold]ory mechanisms should be [bold]sought[bold] and designed[bold].
[normal]32.
[normal]              
[normal]There is a case for re-directing 
[normal]subsidies currently allocated to fossil fuels 
[normal]in order to increase funding
[normal] for 
[normal]CCS research, development and deployment
[normal]. 
[normal]The
[normal] G20 countries 
[normal]have
[normal] 
[normal]already agreed
[normal] 
[normal]to 
[normal]“
[normal]rationalize and
[normal] 
[normal]phase out over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage
[normal] 
[normal]wasteful consumption
[normal]”
[normal]. 
[normal]In the UK
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]fossil fuels are mostly supported
[normal] financially
[normal] 
[normal]by the Government 
[normal]via tax exemptions or reductions, especially 
[normal]through a 
[normal]reduction in
[normal] 
[normal]the value added tax
[normal] 
[normal]applied to households’ fuel and power consumption. 
[normal]Overall
[normal], 
[normal]this support is
[normal] estimated to 
[normal]represent
[normal] more than £4 billion in
[normal] the UK in
[normal] 2011
[normal] (OECD, 2012
[normal]).
[normal] While the removal of households’
[normal] subsidies 
[normal]would 
[normal]be politically challen
[normal]ging,
[normal] 
[normal]diverting some of these resources to support CCS
[normal] 
[normal]could
[normal] make 
[normal]their reform
[normal] less controversial, as funds 
[normal]w
[normal]ould
[normal] 
[normal]ultimately be re-allocated within the fossil fuel industry
[normal] and 
[normal]would 
[normal]potentially reduce the need for direct funding for 
[normal]low-
[normal]carbon technologie
[normal]s, which could otherwise result in higher energy 
[normal]unit costs
[normal].
[normal]33.
[normal]              
[normal]Furthermore
[normal], 
[normal]consistent
[normal] guidance or targets
[normal] applied across the European Union would be helpful
[normal]. For instance, Littlecott 
[normal]et al
[normal].
[normal] (2013) suggest the introduction of a European Union CCS milestone target or, should this prove to be to contentious, 
[normal]an adjustment of
[normal] the current 
[normal]target for
[normal] renewable energy target to allow it to be 
[normal]at least partly 
[normal]met through CCS.
[normal]34.
[normal]              
[normal]It would also be he
[normal]lpful to consider the potential 
[normal]for adjusting
[normal] 
[normal]European 
[normal]state-aid rules affecting CCS deployment. 
[normal]The issue of how to ensure c
[normal]ompliance with state-aid rules
[normal] was raised many times
[normal] during the preparation for the CCS commercialisation competition in the UK, an
[normal]d 
[normal]could
[normal] 
[normal]have significant impact on investment decisions.
[normal]35.
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]cost
[normal] of demonstration projects can be 
[normal]reduced by 
[normal]commercial 
[normal]sale 
[normal]of
[normal] captured
[normal] carbon dioxide
[normal], 
[normal]particularly
[normal] for Enhan
[normal]ced Oil 
[normal]R
[normal]ecovery (EOR)
[normal]. The prices paid in the United States for 
[normal]carbon 
[normal]dioxide for use in
[normal] EOR
[normal] are in the range of $15-30 per tonne (Brown et al., 2012). Some research projects are already 
[normal]underway
[normal] 
[normal](e.g. the EOR Joint Industry project in the North Sea, funded by the Scottish 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment 
[normal]and some private companies
[normal]), and similar
[normal] initiatives could be explored 
[normal]at
[normal] 
[normal]other sites. The timing 
[normal]of
[normal] 
[normal]EOR 
[normal]is
[normal] important because
[normal] there is only a 
[normal]specific
[normal] 
[normal]window of opportunity 
[normal]during
[normal] 
[normal]the lifetime of an oil field when EOR can be implemented efficiently. Missing the window could 
[normal]mean
[normal] 
[normal]that 
[normal]a
[normal] 
[normal]CCS 
[normal]project
[normal] 
[normal]lose
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]its potential for
[normal] 
[normal]profitability. There are also a number of emerging technologies 
[normal]that
[normal] 
[normal]could utilise and permanently store carbon dioxide, such as for chemical uses, concrete and plastic production or algae fertilisation (IEA, 2013). 
[normal]While th
[normal]e amounts of 
[normal]carbon dioxide
[normal] which could be stored via utilisation are orders of magnitude lower than that released, these technologies could have 
[normal]important
[normal] applications. 
[normal]Further research is necessary to determine if a business case can be made 
[normal]for
[normal] 
[normal]new comm
[normal]ercial applications of captured carbon dioxide - including scoping
[normal] studies of
[normal] lifecycle emissions, storage time, cost and total market
[normal] potential
[normal].
[normal]36.
[normal]              
[normal]Third
[normal], 
[normal]regulatory measures should be carefully designed to address the issue of [bold]liabilit[bold]y[bold].[bold] This, in turn, 
[normal]c
[normal]ould
[normal] 
[normal]help improve public perception and understanding of CCS risks and potential.
[normal] 
[normal]We welcome the progress that the Government has been making in this area and the emphasis that DECC plac
[normal]es
[normal] 
[normal]in 
[normal]its
[normal] CCS roadmap 
[normal]on developing the regulatory regime 
[normal](DECC, 2012
[normal]).
[normal]37.
[normal]              
[normal]Storage management and property rights should be clarified, as well as the role of 
[normal]g
[normal]overnment
[normal] in storage exploration, appraisal and development. Monitoring should be appropriately regulated, as 
[normal]a 
[normal]failure to do so could 
[normal]damage
[normal] public trust 
[normal]in
[normal] storage
[normal] facilities and operators.
[normal]38.
[normal]              
[normal]Some liability issues could be addressed with new forms of ‘innovative’ finance, for example where traditional insurance products are modified to transfer, u
[normal]sing
[normal] tightly defined criteria, a subset of the 
[normal]risk of 
[normal]carbon dioxide leakage during the injection phase (for a full description see ClimateWise, 2012). Some risks, however, will remain uninsurable. Ultimately, neither insurers no
[normal]r
[normal] storage operators will be able to bear unlimited liabilities. In these cases, r
[normal]isk sharing with 
[normal]the Government
[normal] will be required. 
[normal]Learning from t
[normal]he experience of nuclear waste 
[normal]could also help to
[normal] defin
[normal]e
[normal] the responsibilit
[normal]ies
[normal] of 
[normal]the G
[normal]overnment and private companies 
[normal]for
[normal] liabilities 
[normal]that 
[normal]are not limited in size.
[normal]39.
[normal]              
[normal]I
[normal]t will be also importa
[normal]nt to clarify the role of CCS in balancing an electricity system with
[normal] an
[normal] increasing 
[normal]capacity of 
[normal]intermittent renewables, in reducing emissions in carbon
[normal]-
[normal]intensive industrial production, and in 
[normal]creating
[normal] ‘negative emissions’ when applied to biomass. On this 
[normal]latter point, there is evidence that 
[normal]implementing
[normal] BECCS 
[normal]could potentially
[normal] reduce ‘NIMBY’ complaints (for example
[normal],
[normal] see Wallquist et al., 2012).
[normal]40.
[normal]              
[normal]Finally, it should also be 
[normal]noted
[normal] that 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]implementation
[normal] of CCS
[normal], together with other 
[normal]low-
[normal]carbon energy 
[normal]technologies
[normal],
[normal] will 
[normal]ultimately 
[normal]lead to an increase in the 
[normal]unit 
[normal]price of electricity and industrial output. 
[normal]The distributional impacts of expected price increases should be carefully assessed [bold]and possible flanking measures [bold]should be investigated[bold],[bold] [bold]for example
[normal] to offset high energy prices 
[normal]for
[normal] 
[normal]poor households
[normal].[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]41.
[normal]              
[normal]The main elements of CCS technology – capture, transport and storage – have already been developed and are being applied in several industrial sectors. 
[normal]Capture technologies are at an advanced stage of industrial development. 
[normal]In the UK
[normal],
[normal] methane is already r
[normal]outinely transported at higher pressures than those required 
[normal]to transport 
[normal]carbon dioxide (7.39 megapascal
[normal]s
[normal]). 
[normal]I
[normal]n several countries
[normal],
[normal] c
[normal]arbon dioxide is already transported via pipelines, ship and road tanker, 
[normal]in 
[normal]some cases in relatively large amounts
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]primari
[normal]ly for use in the food industry or for oil and gas recovery. For example
[normal],
[normal] enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects in the Permian Basin in Texas 
[normal]each year
[normal] 
[normal]process, transport and re-inject around 23 million tonnes of recycled carbon dioxide
[normal], 
[normal]with 
[normal]more than
[normal] 
[normal]2,20
[normal]0 miles of high 
[normal]pressure
[normal] (10-15 MPa
[normal]) 
[normal]pipelines
[normal]. As
[normal] for storage, four large-scale CCS projects have carried out sufficient monitoring to provide confidence that injected carbon dioxide 
[normal]can
[normal] 
[normal]be permanently retained. Collectively they have stored about 50 
[normal]million tonnes of carbon dioxide to date (IEA, 2013)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]42.
[normal]              
[normal]According to the International 
[normal]Energy 
[normal]Agency (2012a), f
[normal]ailure
[normal] to develop CC
[normal]S will increase 
[normal]by 40 per cent 
[normal]the cap
[normal]ital costs of reducing power secto
[normal]r emissions 
[normal]to 
[normal]a 
[normal]level consistent with 
[normal]avoiding a rise of more than
[normal] 2°C 
[normal]in global 
[normal]average 
[normal]temperature
[normal] 
[normal]compared with pre-industrial levels
[normal] (IEA, 2012a).
[normal]43.
[normal]              
[normal]In the UK, a 
[normal]‘No CCS’
[normal] scenario 
[normal]for 2030 produced 
[normal]by the Committee on Climate Change (2013
[normal]b
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]indicates 
[normal]that
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]carbon intensity 
[normal]of the 
[normal]UK 
[normal]power system would only 
[normal]fall to 
[normal]100g
[normal], instead of
[normal] 
[normal]a desired 
[normal]50g
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour 
[normal]by 2030.
[normal] 
[normal]E
[normal]ven this 
[normal]c
[normal]ould
[normal] only be 
[normal]achiev
[normal]ed
[normal] 
[normal]with significant components
[normal] of 
[normal]nuclear and offshore wind
[normal] 
[normal]power
[normal] 
[normal](around 15 GW and 25
[normal] 
[normal]GW respectively).
[normal]44.
[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]he UK w
[normal]ould
[normal] 
[normal]also 
[normal]fail to exploit a likely lucrative export market
[normal] 
[normal]for CCS 
[normal](see section 4 above). Some of the major technology providers 
[normal]are 
[normal]already 
[normal]keen to open 
[normal]up 
[normal]this market
[normal] and 
[normal]exploit
[normal] 
[normal]‘
[normal]first mover
[normal]’
[normal] advantage
[normal]s.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]45.
[normal]              
[normal]As the 
[normal]Select 
[normal]Committee ha
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]recognised, CCS has the potential to play a major role in the global effort to combat climate change. In 
[normal]its
[normal] low
[normal]-
[normal]carbon energy scenario (2 Degrees case)
[normal],
[normal] the 
[normal]International Energy Agency
[normal] 
[normal](2012a) 
[normal]show
[normal]s
[normal] CCS as the technology with the greatest potential for 
[normal]re
[normal]ducing carbon dioxide emissions
[normal]. CCS 
[normal]would 
[normal]account for 22 per cent
[normal] of 
[normal]reductions,
[normal] 
[normal]or 2.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (equivalent to m
[normal]ore than two
[normal]-
[normal]thi
[normal]rds of Europe’s emissions today)
[normal]. This makes CCS a genuinely strategic option for global climate 
[normal]chang
[normal]e 
[normal]mitigation.
[normal]46.
[normal]              
[normal]Although the 
[normal]viability of the 
[normal]component technologies ha
[normal]s
[normal] been demonstrated
[normal],
[normal] there are many uncertainties, as described above, about 
[normal]the
[normal] technical and commercial implementation
[normal] 
[normal]of CCS at a 
[normal]large scale
[normal]. The UK still has significant advantages in terms of well
[normal]-
[normal]understood offshore reservoirs where 
[normal]carbon dioxide
[normal] could be stored, a strong oil and gas sector with relevant expertise, and 
[normal]a capable engineering and research base. While i
[normal]nvestment
[normal] in CCS 
[normal]faces 
[normal]a
[normal] number of policy, legal and insurance challenges, 
[normal]this
[normal] 
[normal]is 
[normal]a key
[normal] climate 
[normal]change 
[normal]mitigation area 
[normal]in which
[normal] the UK can
[normal] 
[normal]lead the way
[normal].
[normal] A
[normal] key technical challenge 
[normal]is
[normal] 
[normal]to 
[normal]integrat
[normal]e
[normal] all 
[normal]of 
[normal]the various sub-systems
[normal], and to 
[normal]ensure that they operate
[normal] efficiently
[normal] togethe
[normal]r and
[normal], subsequently, 
[normal]within 
[normal]a network. In particular, 
[normal]an 
[normal]understanding 
[normal]of 
[normal]how CCS 
[normal]can
[normal] operate 
[normal]most effectively within 
[normal]a diverse energy system will be of particular value.
