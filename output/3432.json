"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Society for Applied Microbiology (AMR0036)&#xa0;\nThe Society for Applied Microbiology\n (S\nf\nAM)\n is the oldest microbiology society in the UK. \n&#xa0;\nS\nf\nAM envisages a future where applied microbiology research and development is strong in the UK and beyond, and the applications of microbiology contribute significantly to all global challenges facing humanity, including infectious diseases; the changing environment; sustainability of energy, food, water, and land resources; and economic growth.\n&#xa0;\nThis response is in addition to S\nf\nAM’s endorsement of the Society of Biology submission. S\nf\nAM is a member organization of the Society of Biology.\n&#xa0;\nQ. How has antimicrobial resistance developed in the past decade?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ.\n&#xa0;\nWhat are the gaps in our knowledge about antimicrobial resistance?\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nIt will also be important to understand what resistance reservoir exists in normal human and animal commensal microbiota (even prior to any antibiotic exposure). \n&#xa0;\nWe need to know:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ. Is there sufficient research and investment into new antibiotics or other treatments and methods to ensure continued protection against infection? If not, how could this be rectified?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ. What measures (including behavioural change) have been most effective in controlling the spread of resistant pathogens, and could such measures be used to control other pathogens?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ. What global coordination and action is required to fight antimicrobial resistance and is the UK contributing enough towards cross-border initiatives?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nUK 1970 - The solution - Swann recommendations:\n&#xa0;\nEU 2006. Ban of use of growth promoters in animal feeds ‘Regulation 1831/2003/EC on additives for use in animal nutrition’ ‘This regulation will strengthen the EU’s rules on the safety of animal feed and complete the EU ban on the use of antibiotics as growth promoters Both these objectives are of major importance to the EU’s food safety strategy and indeed to wider considerations of animal health’\n David Byrne, EU Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, 2006 &#xa0;\nUK Chief Medical Officer Reports 2009, 2011 ‘\nThere should be a ban on the use of certain types of antibiotics (quinolones and cephalosporins) in animals, in order to protect their activity in humans’ \nSir Liam Donaldson, CMO, 2009 ‘N\national approach to tackling antimicrobial resistance should be managed jointly between DH and Defra to ensure that a comprehensive integrated programme is developed’. \nDame Sally Davies, CMO, 2013 &#xa0;\nEuropean Food Safety Authority (EFSA), 2011 Scientific Opinion on the public health risks of bacterial strains producing ESBLsand/or AmpC β-lactamases in food and food-producing animals ‘A highly effective control option would be to stop all uses of cephalosporins/systemically active 3rd/4th generation cephalosporins, or to restrict their use (use only to be allowed under specific circumstances)’. \n&#xa0;\nEuropean Parliament October 2011 ‘European Parliament calls upon the European Commission to make legislative proposals to phase out the prophylactic use of antibiotics in livestock farming in the EU’ \nEuropean Parliament, 27 October 2011 &#xa0;\nSANCO strategy on Antimicrobial Resistance5-year strategy presented on European Antibiotic Awareness Day,18 November 2011  Holistic approach: public health, food safety, consumer safety, environment, animal health and welfare as well as non-therapeutic use of antimicrobials \n&#xa0;\nWHO Europe strategy on antibiotic resistance Seven action areas: 1. Promote national coordination \n2. Strengthen surveillance \n3. Promote rational use of antibiotics, including surveillance of antibiotic consumption \n4. Improve infection control and stewardship of antibiotic use in health care settings \n5. Promote surveillance, prevention and control of antibiotic resistance in the food chain \n6. Promote research and innovation on new antibiotics \n7. Improve awareness on antibiotic use and risk of increasing resistance \n&#xa0;\nFighting antibiotic resistance a priority for WHO/Europe European strategy under development \n2011 publication suggests actions for tackling antibiotic resistance from a food safety perspective &#xa0;\nKey messages for countries 1. Improve overall coordination \n2. Improve regulatory framework \n3. Reduce the need for and promote prudent use of antibiotics \n4. Improve surveillance \n5. Advocate and communicate \n6.

What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Government’s 2013-2018 strategy for tackling antimicrobial resistance? What changes might be made to further strengthen the Government’s action plan?\n&#xa0;\nStrengths\n:  realisation that there is a problem and that measure should be undertaken to combat this problem.\n&#xa0;\nThe Department of Health 5 year strategy states at Point 2.1, page 8; ‘Increasing scientific evidence suggests that the clinical issues with antimicrobial resistance that we face in human medicine are primarily the result of antibiotic use in people, rather than antibiotics in animals’.\n&#xa0;\nWeaknesses\n: lack of willingness to introduce comprehensive legislation to combat resistance development in both the human and veterinary sectors.\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/09/13/jac.dkt349.full.pdf+html\n"
