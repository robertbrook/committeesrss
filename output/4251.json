"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Royal Meteorological Society (IPC0029)Description of submission1. This submission is made on behalf of the Royal Meteorological Society (RMetS). \nThe Royal Meteorological Society is the Learned and Professional Society for weather and climate. The Society is a registered charity. Its affairs are run by a Council of Trustees. Council comprises a total of nineteen Officers and Ordinary Members of Council elected at the Annual General Meeting.\n&#xa0;\n2. The submission was drafted by the Chair of the \nRMetS’s\n Climate Science Communications Group (CSCG), incorporating comments from the CSCG members and members of Council. It has been approved by RMetS Council.\n A list of members of the CSCG and of Council are provided in\n Note 1 \nbelow. \n3. The inquiry invites comments with regard to the IPCC’s fifth assessment report (AR5). Our responses refer specifically to the report of Working Group 1 (WG1).\nDeclaration of interest4\n.

Declaration of interests of members of Council\n. \nThose marked (*) were excluded from taking part in drafti\nng or approving this submission\n:\nJoanna Haigh (Contributing author to IPCC 5\nth\n assessment report\n and Lead Author on \nthe third assessment\n)\nDavid Stevenson (Contributing author to IPCC 5\nth\n assessment report)\nLiz Howell* (\nrequired under BBC Editorial Guidelines to maintain impartiality and \nindependence within the BBC\n)\nHow robust are the conclusions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis report?7\n. \nThe conclusions \nof the report \nare graded in terms of probability and confidence. \nWe believe this provides a clear description of the robustness of the conclusions. \nThe most robust conclusions are indicated by high levels \no\nf likelihood and/or confidence. Conversely the \nleast robust \nare assigned low likelihood/confidence.\n \nHow much scope is there to question the report’s conclusions? 8\n. \nThe report draws on the published peer-reviewed literature and as such represents the current scientific understanding, with the conclusions being carefully graded in terms of likelihood/confidence, noting where appropriate the levels of uncertainty.\nTo what extent does AR5 reflect the range of views among climate scientists?9\n.\n \nGiven AR5 is a comprehensive synthesi\ns of the published literature, our judgement is that\n \nthe report\n accurately reflects the views of the vast majority of professional climate scientists who are actively working the field.\nCan any of the areas of the science now be considered settled as a result of AR5’s publication, if so which?&#xa0; 10\n. \nThis depends on how one defines “settled”\n.\n In its purest interpretation, no area of science is ever settled since the scientific method \nalways \nallows for new evidence to overturn previously established theories. \nTo\n \nprovide readers with an accurate assessment of the state of scientific understanding\n, \nthe report \nqualifies many of its conclusions with \nlevels of certainty \nin the form of likelihood/confidence. \nThe report \nalso \nmakes some unqualified statements when justified, for example, the Summary for Policymakers states that “Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the surface than any preceding decade since the 1850s” and “Warming of the climate system is unequivocal”.\n \nWhat areas need further effort to reduce the levels of uncertainty?11\n. \nScientific research is an on\n-going process that \nattempt\ns\n to reduce \nthe levels of uncertainty in all\n \nrelevant \narea\ns. I\nt is important to note that in some instances it is reasonable to anticipate that further research may reduce the range of uncertainty, whereas in others the uncerta\ninty is a fundamental property (\nfor example there will always be a \n50%\n chance of \ntossing a “head” on an unbiased coin\n)\n. \nThere are on-going efforts to narrow the range of uncertainty\n, for example,\n in a measure of the climate response with feedbacks to a change in atmospher\nic carbon dioxide concentration\n known as the “climate sensitivity”. \nA key area of climate research where it is anticipated that further progress will reduce uncertainties is in the prediction of the regional detail of climate change\n.\nHow effective is AR5 and the summary for policymakers in conveying&#xa0;what is meant by uncertainty in scientific terms? Would a focus on risk rather than uncertainty be useful?12\n. \nIn general it is \nchalle\nnging to communicate the \nscientific \nmeaning of \nthe words \n“uncertainty” \nand “risk” because they differ\n \nin subtle ways \nfrom the\n \ncommon-us\nes\n of the word\ns, and indeed the words are used in subtly different ways in other fields such as \neconomics. \nGiven this, it is always worth testing and evaluating whether statements have been interpreted as intended and exploring alternative ways of communicating. \nThe \nfull \nAR5 \nreport including\n \nthe summary for policymakers us\nes\n a standardised framew\nork for describing \n“\nuncertaint\ny\n”\n \nbased around likelihood/confidence quan\ntifiers\n as described in the published guidance note on the consistent treatment of uncertainties.\n \nWe note that a\nn assessment of “risk” would typically incorporate information that is beyond the scope of WG1, but within the scope of WG2 and WG3.\nDoes the AR5 address the reliability of climate models?13\n. \nThe R\neport devotes \nChapter 9 to \na comprehensive\n, balanced and realistic\n \nevaluation of climate models\n which is based on the published literature and draws extensively on the results of the \nCoupled Model \nIntercomparison\n Project Phase 5 (CMIP5).\n As stated in the report\n (Chapter 9, final draft)\n c\nlimate models are based on physical principles, and they reproduce many important aspects of observed climate. We agree with the report when it states that both these aspects contribute to \na\n \n“\nconfidence in the models’ suitability for their application in detection and attribution studies and for quantitative future predictions and projections\n”, and when it notes that “w\nhereas weather and seasonal climate predictions can be regularly verified, climate projections spanning a century or more cannot. This is particularly the case as anthropogenic forcing is driving the climate system toward conditions not previously observed in the instrumental record, and it will always be a limitation.”\nHas AR5 sufficiently explained the reasons behind the widely reported hiatus in the global surface temperature record?1\n4\n. T\nhe report summarised the scientific understanding of recent \nglobal \naverage \nsurface \ntemperature change as described in the published literature\n up to the WG1 publication acceptance cut-off date of 15 March 2013\n. This outlined the factors \nthought \nmost likely to have contributed to recent changes. This\n is an \non-going and \nactive area of research \n(see for example \n“\nCoverage bias in the HadCRUT4 temperature series and its impact on recent temperature trends” by \nCowtan\n and Way in the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society\n,\n a\nc\ncepted manuscript online: 12 Nov\n 2013)\n.\nDo the AR5 Physical Science Basis report’s conclusions strengthen or weaken the economic case for action to prevent dangerous climate change? 1\n5\n. \nThe \nscientific conclusions of the WG1 report \nprovide an evidence base for input into economic \ndiscussions\n. \nI\nn the majority of instances, the \nscientific \nconclusions of the AR5 WG1 report are strengthened compared with \nprevious reports\n in the sense that the conclusions have remained broadly similar but are now supported by more evidence.\n The WG1 report does not comment on the economic case for action to prevent dangerous climate change and this is outside the regime of expertise of the Royal Meteorological Society.\nIs the IPCC process an effective mechanism for assessing scientific knowledge? Or has it focused on providing a justification for political commitment?1\n6\n. \nWe believe that th\ne IPCC process provides a comprehensive, objective, open and transparent\n assessment of the state of scientific knowledge.\n \nWe note that \nthe \nprocess involves\n \na significant commitment from the scientific community with\n the voluntary contribution of many thousands of scientists worldwide\n. We argue that it is vital that this commitment acts to stimulate scientific research \nrather than placing a burden that may hinder scientific progress\n and that the IPCC process, or a\nny modification to \nit, must ensure this.\n \nThe \nIPCC \nreports are neutral with respect to policy\n,\n being policy-relevant but never policy-prescriptive.\n \nBy endorsing the IPCC reports, governments acknowledge the authority of their scientific content.\n \nWhat relevance do the IPCC’s conclusions have in respect of the review of the fourth Carbon Budget? 1\n7\n.\n \nThe report concluded that “Continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system. Limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.” It also concluded “\nCumulative emissions of CO2 largely determine global mean surface warming by the late 21st century and beyond. Most aspects of climate change will persist for many centuries even if emissions of CO2 are stopped. This represents a substantial multi-century climate change commitment created by past, present and future emissions of CO2.” We suggest that both these conclusions may be of relevance to the review of the fourth Carbon Budget.\n&#xa0;\nNote 1\nA list of members of the CSCG and Council\nCSCG members:Dr \nEmily Shuckburgh (Chair)\nDr \nEd Hawkins\nIan \nStrangeways\nProf \nJohn Mitchell\nProf \nTim Palmer\nProf \nRowan Sutton\nCouncil members:Prof \nJoanna Haigh (President)\nJennie Campbell\nProf \nEllie Highwood\nDr \nDavid Stevenson\nRob Varley\nDr \nBob Riddaway\nAlan Radford\nProf \nDavid Schultz\nCdr Derek Swannick\nProf \nBria\nn Golding\nDr \nGeoff Jenkins\nDr \nEmily Sh\nuckburgh\nJohn Goulding\nBaden Hall\nLiz Howell\nShanti Majithia\nProf \nDavid Marshall\nProf \nDudley \nShallcross\nJohn \nHirst\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
