"VEP 0010\n&#xa0;\nWritten Submission by Jonathan Fisher QC (VEP 0010)&#xa0;1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhis \nevidence \naddresses the single issue of whether the right to vote is properly to be considered a human right.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe short answer, in my\n view\n, is that it \nis \nnot. \n&#xa0;\n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe prisoner voting debate has been characterised\n by a failure to distinguish \nbetween\n \nthe guarantee to \nhold free elections on the one hand, and \nthe \nm\nan\nner in which free elections are to be held on the other. The former, namely the requirement \nimposed on a State \nto hold free elections at reasonable intervals, is a fundamental freedom and recognised as a human right. The latter, namely the manner in which an \nelection\n is held and \na citizen’s ability to \nparticipate in it, is not.\n Universal suf\nfrage is the means by which th\ne human right requiring the State to hold free elections \nis realised, but it is \nnot \na human \nright itself.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis distinction \nbetween the right to hold free elections and a citizen’s ability to participate in an election \nis reflected in \nArticle 3 \nProtocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights \n(“the Convention”) \nwhich provides as follows:\n&#xa0;\nARTICLE 3\nRight to free elections\nThe High Contracting Parties undertake to hold free elections at\n \nreasonable intervals by secret ballot, under conditions which will\n \nensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the\n \nchoice of the legislature.\n&#xa0;\n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe omission to \narticulate \na human right guaranteeing an individual’s right to participate in free elections was deliberate.\n At a meeting of the Committee of Experts on Human Rights\n (“the Committee”)\n at the Council of Europe on 3 February 1950, Sir Oscar Dowson (the UK’s representative) explained:\n&#xa0;\n“ … It is probable that suffrage is as wide in the United Kingdom as in any other country; yet even in the United Kingdom it is inaccurate to speak of suffrage as “universal”. In no State is the right to vote enjoyed even by citizens without qualifications. The qualifications required differ from State to State, and it is our view that the variety of circumstances to be considered may justify the imposition of a variety of qualifications, as a condition of the exercise of suffrage ...”\n \n&#xa0;\n6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nE\nven if a reference to universal suffrage had been included in Article 3 Protocol 1, the other signatory \ncountries\n were clear that this would not confer on \na \ncitizen a \nhuman \nrigh\nt to vote in every circumstance\n. The response of the other member States was \nsummarised \n \nin \nthe \nCommittee’\ns\n \ndraft \non 15 February 1950 in the following terms:\n&#xa0;\n“The United Kingdom representative stated that his Government was opposed to the insertion of an Article of this kind in the Convention by reason of the practical difficulties which would thereby arise, particularly over the definition of the term “universal suffrage”, the right to vote being, in all countries, subject to restrictions [...]\n&#xa0;\nThe other Committee members, however, were of the opinion that the term “universal suffrage” had a sufficiently clear and precise meaning for the European countries and did not exclude the usual restriction on the right to vote. The members felt, moreover, that even if universal suffrage and secret ballot was not an absolute guarantee of democracy, it nevertheless constituted an important guarantee which merited protection by the Convention.”\n \n&#xa0;\n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTwo significant points emerge from \na consideration of \nthis passage. First, as already noted, signatory \ncountries \ndid not consider that the notion of universal suffrage excluded any restriction on the right to vote. Secondly, the significance of the reference to universal suffrage is not the articulation of a human right to vote, but rather the recognition of the means \nor mechanism \nby which \na \nfree election\n is \nsecured.  \n&#xa0;\n8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis understanding was re-iterated in 1966 in Article 25 of \nthe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. \nThis \nprovide\nd\n that\n:\n“Every citizen shall have the right and the opportunity, without any of the distinctions mentioned in article 2 and without unreasonable restrictions:\n(a) To take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives;\n(b) To vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot, guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors;\n(\nc) To have access, on general terms of equality, to public service in his country.”\n&#xa0;\n9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThirty years later, this understanding remained unchanged. In 1996, when considering the issue of universal suffrage, the United Nations Office of the Commission for Human Rights made clear in a General Comment that:\n&#xa0;\n“\nState reports should describe the rules governing the right to vote, and the application of those rules in the period covered by the report. State reports should also describe factors which impede citizens from exercising the right to vote and the positive measures which have been adopted to overcome these factors.\n&#xa0;\nIn their reports, States parties should indicate and explain the legislative provisions which would deprive citizens of their right to vote. The grounds for such deprivation should be objective and reasonable. If conviction for an offence is a basis for suspending the right to vote, the period of such suspension should be proportionate to the offence and the sentence. Persons who are deprived of liberty but who have not been convicted should not be excluded from exercising the right to vote.”\n&#xa0;\n10.\n&#xa0; \nI\nt is interesting to note that the United Nations Office con\nsidered \nthat the loss of a convicted prisoner’s ability to vote \nwas\n not incompatible with the right of universal suffrage or the holding of free elections \nto secure a \ndemocratic\nally elected government. \n&#xa0;\n11.\n&#xa0; \nThis understanding is consistent with an \napproach which safeguards the holding of free elections as a fundamental freedom \nin \nmodern democratic society but stops short of recognising a human right which guarantees to every citizen the ability to participate in this process. \n&#xa0;\n12.\n&#xa0; \nA restriction on a convicted prisoner’s ability to participate\n in the democratic process is \nboth \nreasonable and objectively \njustifiable.\n \n&#xa0;\n13.\n&#xa0; \nWhere a person\n’s failure to \ncomply with the rules of modern civilized society \nis sufficiently serious to justify the imposition of a custodial sentence, he demonstrates a rejection of the societal norms by which his fellow citizens have chosen to live. \nW\nithdrawal from participation in civil society is an important \nfeature of a custodial sentence, \nand it \nis \ninconsistent with \na convicted\n prisoner’s \nrejection of these societal norms to permit him to participate in civil society pending his rehabilitation in due course\n.\n The period of exclusion is proportionate, the length of sentence having been determined in accordance with rationally defensible criteria.\n&#xa0;\n14.\n&#xa0; \nIf a \nperson or a \ngroup of people were to be disenfranchised on grounds which \nwe\nre arbitrary or capricious, \nit would infringe a human right but not \na right to vote. \nT\nhe infringement would engage a person’s right to be treated equally and not subjected to discrimination on the grounds of sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\n In consequence, a signatory country would infringe its positive obligation under Article 3 Protocol 1 \n“\nto hold free elections \n… \nunder conditions which ensured the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of legislature\n”\n.\n \nBut this is not the same as saying that Article 3 Protocol 1 establishes a discrete human right for an individual to vote which is free-standing. \n&#xa0;\n15.\n&#xa0; \nThere is much discussion amongst legal theorists as to how human rights come to be recognised and their substance determined. Theories based on \nJohn\n Locke’s social contract \nand/or \nthe existence of natural law rights have given way in \nmodern \ntimes to a positivist approach, by which human rights are recognised in circumstances where a broad section of society acknowledges this to be the case. \n&#xa0;\n16.\n&#xa0; \nApplying the\n \npositivist and \nself-sustaining approach to the recognition of legal norms,  \nI believe \nit is clear that the \nright \nto free elections which guarantee the democratic process is protected as a fundament\nal freedom whereas \nan individual’s ability to participate in the process is not.\n \n&#xa0;\nDeclaration of interest\n: I was a Conservative nominated member of the Commission on a Bill of Rights appointed by the Coalition Government which reported in 2012, and between 20\n06 and 2010 \nI was Chairman of Research of the Society of Conservative Lawyers.\n&#xa0;\nJune 2013\n1\n&#xa0;\n See Raab, Strasbourg in the Dock: Prisoner Voting, Human Rights &amp; the Case for Democracy, 2011\n \nT\nravaux \npréparatoires, \nIII, p.182.\n \nT\nravaux \npréparatoires, \nIII, p.264.\n \nGeneral Comment No. 25: The right to participate in public affairs, voting rights and the right of equal access to public service (Art. 25), 12/07/1996,\n CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.7, General Comment No. 25.
