[[[Crime]]]

[[[ Statistics]]]&#xa0;Thank you for your letter of 6th December 2013. &#xa0;My Police and Crime Plan, which is available on the OPCC website (www-wiltshire.pcc.gov.uk) speaks of priorities, objectives and key initiatives.  I have been consistently reluctant to set targets given the inherent problems they entail.  The target for the number of offenders brought to justice is a prime example.  In order to chase the target police officers effectively abandoned their discretion in relation to low-level offences.  A generation of younger people was disproportionally criminalised and the criminal justice system creaked under the weight of inappropriate cases.  Similarly, a rigid target to answer non-emergency calls within 30 seconds led inevitably to over stretched call takers dumping calls on inappropriate extensions where the wrong person answered or no-one answered the calls at all.&#xa0;There does however have to be some method by which I can judge, and the public at election time can judge, whether we are going in the right direction.  I have therefore set what I term thresholds.  These are the levels across a range of indicators where I would expect performance to sit.  They are intended to encourage management and the workforce alike to concentrate on the right areas and to do so diligently.  Both I, and the performance team that advises me, are alert to the possibility of counter-productive performance monitoring.  Along with the Chief Constable, I believe that we are achieving the right balance.&#xa0;As regards the integrity of recorded crime figures, I and my staff have full access to the crime registrar.  We watch crime trends carefully and always consider the possibility that a recording practice has varied if we see significant change.  I am setting up an independent panel of volunteers to dip sample cases where a resolution outside the criminal justice system has been recorded. It may be possible to extend this to a more general check and test of recording policy. However this can only be an additional safeguard and public reassurance. We do, in my view, need a robust inspection framework. A portion of my budget is spent on audit and inspection, as you will be aware. Whilst I would not be willing to pay more, I believe the auditing of crime recording practice should be a core function of HMIC. Their resources should be directed far more closely on this area, unglamorous though it may be. In years past I recall regular national audits for crime recording. Problems that are surfacing in different parts of the country may have been avoided had this regime not been discontinued.&#xa0;I hope this is of use to you and your members&#xa0;&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;
