[normal] [bold]Annex A[bold]&#xa0;[bold]STATISTICAL DIGEST: PASSENGER TRANSPORT IN ISOLATED COMMUNITIES[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Most isolated communities are in rural areas and the evidence
[normal] in this Statistical Annex concentrates on rural areas, and differences between rural and urban areas. The annex mainly draws on data from 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The National Travel Survey 
[normal]over
[normal] 2011
[normal] and 20
[normal]12 shows that around 9 per cent of households in rural areas
[normal] in Great Britain
[normal] do not own a car
[normal] (or van)
[normal], compared to 45 per 
[normal]cent in London Boroughs, 33 per cent in metropolitan bu
[normal]ilt up areas and 27 per cent in large urban areas. In rural areas, 52 per cent of households owned more than two cars.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]So while a small minority of households in rural areas do not have access to a car, more than 90% of households do. As a result the
[normal] car 
[normal]is a more dominant mode
[normal] of transport
[normal] for residents of rural 
[normal]communities
[normal] than for residents of urban settlements of any size.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]With car ownership being higher in rural areas, travel by car is also the predominant means of transport in rural areas. I
[normal]n fact, t
[normal]ravel by car as a driver is the predominant
[normal] means of transport in all area types (with the exception of 
[normal]London
[normal]), but it is at its highest in 
[normal]rural areas.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Rural residents 
[normal]made 526 trips on average by car or van as a driver in 2011 and 2012 combin
[normal]ed (and another 239 as a passenger) compared to 357 as a driver in metropolitan built-up areas.

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Chart 2: Average number of car/van trips (as driver or passenger) by area type: [bold]Great Britain[bold], 2011 and 2012 combined[bold]Source: National Travel Survey
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]People in rural areas also take the least number of walking and bus trips per person. In 2011 and 2012, people walked an average of 147 trips, and took a 
[normal]local bus for an average of 28 trips. This compares to 
[normal]a 
[normal]Great Britain
[normal] average of 217 trips and 62 trips walking and by bus respectively.
[normal] [bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]P
[normal]roportionally fewer households in rural 
[normal]or isolated areas 
[normal]have access to a regular bus service th
[normal]an 
[normal]households in 
[normal]urban areas.
[normal] This can be measured by the National Travel Survey’s ‘bus availability’ measure. This 
[normal]is expressed as the percentage of households whose nearest bus stop is within 13 minutes walk and has a service at least once an hour.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Over
[normal] 2011 and 2012, 59 per cent
[normal] of households in rural ar
[normal]eas in 
[normal]Great Britain
[normal] were within reach of bus under this measure, compared to 98 per cent of
[normal] households in 
[normal]metropolitan built-up areas and 91 per cent in 
[normal]Great Britain
[normal] as a whole. Indeed, all other (non-
[normal]rural) area types
[normal] 
[normal]scored 90 per cent or more on this measure over
[normal] 201
[normal]1 and 201
[normal]2
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, this figure has increased in recent years in rural areas. 
[normal]Between 2002 and 
[normal]2011 and 
[normal]2012
[normal] combined
[normal], the proportion of households in rural areas that were within 13 minutes walk of an hourly or better bus service increased 
[normal]from 48% to 59%.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The introduction of statutory free concessionary travel for older people on local buses has had the biggest propo
[normal]rtionate impact in rural areas. The take-up of concessionary travel passes among eligible residents of rural areas increased from 34% in 2005 (the year before the scheme’s introduction) to 66% in 2012, an increase of 32 percentage points. The equivalent in
[normal]creases were 
[normal]12 percentage points in metropolitan built-up areas, and 3 percentage points in 
[normal]London
[normal] boroughs.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Department for Transport bus statistics also unsurprisingly show fewer local bus journeys in rural areas than in urban areas. The total number of bus journeys in 
[normal]England
[normal] in “significant rural” and “predominantly rural” local authority areas has been broadl
[normal]y level since 2007/08. In the latest year available, 2011/12, there were 451 million journeys in significantly rural areas, and 322 million journeys in predominantly rural areas. This was about 17 per cent of the total number of bus journeys in that year.
[normal] However, these areas contained 37.4% of the resident population of 
[normal]England
[normal] in 2011
[normal].
[normal]1
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]While the usage of certain modes of travel can differ markedly between rural and urban areas as described above, 
[normal]the 
[normal]overall 
[normal]number of trips 
[normal]made in a year varies much less. However, those in
[normal] more rural settlements travel much 
[normal]longer
[normal] distances on averag
[normal]e than those in urban areas
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Overall, 
[normal]the 
[normal]average distance travelled per person per year 
[normal]for residents of rural 
[normal]areas
[normal] was 9,764 miles over 2011 and 2012 (which included 5,731 miles by car). This 
[normal]was around double the average of 
[normal]London
[normal] residents (4,687
[normal] miles
[normal]) and residents of Metropolitan built-u
[normal]p areas (5,276 miles).
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]R
[normal]ural areas
[normal], and in particular very isolated rural
[normal] areas, are 
[normal]much 
[normal]less densely populat
[normal]ed
[normal] than urban areas. This means that rural service locations (schools, food stores, GPs, etc.) are 
[normal]likely to 
[normal]be more sparse, and to 
[normal]serve larger geographical 
[normal]catchment 
[normal]area
[normal]s.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The DfT’s accessibility indicators measure access to eight key services (employmen
[normal]t centres, primary schools, secondary schools, further education institutions, GPs, hospitals, food stores and town centres) by public transport/walking, cycle and car. 
[normal]Results for 2011
[normal] 
[normal]show that users in urban areas 
[normal]in 
[normal]England
[normal] 
[normal]could access key services by
[normal] public transport/walking, on average, in 12 minutes compared to 22 minutes in rural areas
[normal]. However, there was much less difference in the average access times for car users, which only varied between 6 minutes and 7 minutes across urban and rural areas re
[normal]spectively
[normal].

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]As shown above, household access to cars is highest in rural areas. These
[normal] figures therefore suggest that accessibility difficulties will particularly affect the minority of rural households that do not have a car, and therefore need to use other modes of transport to access key services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Chart 4 (below) shows the percentage of
[normal] user populations in 
[normal]England
[normal] with “reasonable” access to key services.
[normal] (This is a 
[normal]measure of accessibility which takes into account the sensitivity of users to the travel time for each service)
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The variation between rural and urban a
[normal]reas 
[normal]was greatest fo
[normal]r further education institutions (17 
[normal]percentage point
[normal] difference between rural and urban areas), and least for primary schools (5 
[normal]percentage point
[normal] difference).
