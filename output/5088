[normal]WRITTEN EVIDENCE SUBMITTED TO THE EFRA COMMITTEE ON BEHALF OF THE GLOBAL FEDERATION OF ANIMAL SANCTUARIES[bold] (GFAS)[bold]January 2014[bold]T
[normal]he EFRA Committee is seeking written submissions of evidence in regard to 
[normal]the following:
[normal]The following is submitted on behalf of the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries (GFAS).
[normal]SUMMARY[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1, [bold]About GFAS[bold]The Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries (GFAS) is an international non-profit organisati
[normal]on dedicated to 
[normal]helping sanctuaries to help animals.
[normal] 
[normal]GFAS promotes and validates excellence in sanctuary management and humane and responsible care of animals through a global system of accreditation, collaboration and 
[normal]mentoring. 
[normal] GFAS promotes the develop
[normal]ment of greater recognition and r
[normal]esources for sanctuaries, and works
[normal] to 
[normal]eliminate the causes of displaced animals.
[normal]GFAS is proud to provide 
[normal]comprehensive
[normal] standards on sanctuary excellence,
[normal] and operates a 
[normal]rigorous accreditation system 
[normal]by which sanctuaries are assessed against these standards 
[normal]through a written application, review of documents and site visit, 
[normal]in order to achieve
[normal] accreditation and verification. 
[normal]The GFAS Standards of Excellence were developed and reviewed with the input of
[normal] animal 
[normal]welfare experts
[normal], non-profit professionals, sanctuary managers, 
[normal]and veterinarians, utilis
[normal]ing existing standards from outstanding sanctuaries as a starting framework and refined/expanded upon based on knowledge and expertise of contributors.
[normal]GFAS con
[normal]siders a 
[normal]sanctuary 
[normal]to be 
[normal]an establishment that provides lifetime care for animals that have been abused, injured, abandoned, or are otherwise in need. The animals may come from sources 
[normal]including, but not limited to, private owners, research laboratories, g
[normal]overnment authorities, the entertainment industry, and zoos.
[normal]All GFAS 
[normal]sanctuaries
[normal] must adhere to certain policies as set out in our standards, including but not limited to:
[normal]Facilities that are not genuine 
[normal]sanctuaries, on the other hand, 
[normal]may 
[normal]buy and sell 
[normal]primates
[normal], ex
[normal]hibit the animals on and off site, allow the public to 
[normal]have direct contact with primates
[normal], breed 
[normal]primates
[normal], and allow the public 
[normal]to visit
[normal] on a regular basis without escort. 
[normal]In addition, their 
[normal]facilities 
[normal]may be substandard. 
[normal]2. [bold]Situation in the UK[bold]GFAS has ac
[normal]credited and verified several primate sanctuaries in North America, where the issue of primates as pets is a particular problem in terms of numbers. 
[normal]To date, GFAS has accredited one primate sanctuary in the UK. We are aware of a handful of other primate-ke
[normal]eping facilities across Europe that might also meet the standards for verification or accreditation by GFAS.
[normal]It is apparent that there is a dearth of suitable facilities for rehoming and rescuing primates. Allowing the ownership and trade of pet primates t
[normal]o continue without this safety net would be irresponsible.
[normal] 
[normal]We note that there is currently no definition of an animal sanctuary in UK legislation. We do not consider that this should be an obstacle to a ban on the keeping of primates as pets. Genuine sanc
[normal]tuaries do not keep primates as pets, nor do they keep them specifically for exhibition. Furthermore they do not trade in primates.
[normal] A ban on the keeping of pet primates or on the trade in primates would be unlikely to affect the activities of responsible a
[normal]nimal sanctuaries, particularly if legislation is tailored towards 
[normal]banning 
[normal]the keeping of primates by individuals in a domestic environment.
[normal]3. [bold]Conclusions[bold]We 
[normal]are convinced 
[normal]that the keeping of primates in the UK should be restricted to licensed zoos and to genuine animal sanctuaries. We consider facilities 
[normal]to be genuine sanctuaries if they 
[normal]are already accredited or verified by GFAS, or are likely to comply with GFAS standards
[normal].
[normal]At this time, we do not offer comment on whether a ban on the keeping and/or a ban on the trade in primates as pets is the most suitable mechanism for achieving this restriction.
[normal]In the event of a ban, GFAS remains willing to assist Defra and other stake
[normal]holders in advising on the best options for primates currently kept as pets.
[normal]GFAS looks forward to working with and alongside other stakeholders in verifying and/or accrediting suitable facilities across Europe, where appropriate.
