defaultWe are committed to sharing our expertise, knowledge, discovery, insight and analysis in order to improve the UK’s economic, social, intellectual and cultural circumstances, and do so primarily through scholarly outputs, education, public engagement, translational research, commercial and social enterprise activity, and engagement with public policy and professional practice.

defaultThis Submission to the Committee has been prepared by members of the UCL Communicating Climate Science Policy Commission:
default&#xa0;
default1. Evidence from climate science shows that the modern world is founded on a false assumption - that it can be powered by fossil fuels with impunity. Reworking this “ultimate stranded asset”, whilst adapting to the climate disruption to which past human activities have already committed us, represents a massive challenge. It requires myriad tailored actions on the part of a large fraction of the 
defaultpeoples of the world in their personal, professional and public lives, at all levels, and in all sectors, of society. 
default&#xa0;
default2. There are many barriers to galvanising the appropriate and necessary actions. Key steps are to convince both a critical mass of individuals with influence, and the general public, to recognise the priority and urgency of the issue, and to motivate them to not only act within their remit, but to establish the framework and vision within which massive devolved action can take place. 
default&#xa0;
default3. While a majority of the general public broadly accept that climate change is occurring, and that human activity plays at least some role in this, the severity of the threat and the urgency of individual and collective action, as well as exactly what we need to do, is not widely appreciated. Neither is the extent to which individual and collective action is needed to prevent serious climate disruption. 
default&#xa0;
default4. Increasing public scepticism about climate change, as well as diminishing concern about its effects - as noted in the Select Committee’s Terms of Reference - have been well documented in public opinion research, both in the UK and internationally. However, recent survey data indicate that these beliefs and attitudes may have stabilised (e.g. Shuckburgh et al, 2012; Leiserowitz et al., 2012). 
default&#xa0;
default5. Many reasons have been put forward to help account for the period of increasing scepticism, and scepticism about the issue more generally. These include the technical nature of the evidence, a high degree of disconnection between people’s daily lives and the problem (“not me, not now”), 
defaultissue-fatigue, the impact of the global financial crisis, distrust – especially following “ClimateGate”, “false balance” in the coverage by the media, and the deepening politicisation of the issue
default (see Pidgeon, 2012 for a review).
default&#xa0;
default6. While surveys of representative samples of influential figures and groups are not available, observation of their rhetoric and actions strongly suggests that, in general, these have no greater understanding of the urgent need for action than the public, and possibly less. 
default&#xa0;
default7. There is copious evidence for a well-funded, well-organised and resolute campaign by vested interests to undermine the credibility of climate science and climate scientists, and to sow doubt and confusion about the subject, with a view to delaying or preventing action to address it (see Oreskes and Conway, 2010 for example).
