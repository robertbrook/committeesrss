Written evidence submitted by defaultForensic Science Northern Ireland (defaultFSNIdefault) (FSS041)defaultFSNI Declaration of InterestsdefaultThis response represents the views of Forensic Science Northern Ireland (FSNI), an Executive Agency of the Department of Justice (DOJ), 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default.
defaultThis response is from the operational perspective of an organisation providing a broad range of integrated forensic science services to the criminal justice system in 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default. The mix of cases investigated by FSNI tends more towards serious crime and terrorism than volume crime, which may mean a somewhat different perspective compared to 
defaultEngland
default and 
defaultWales
default. 
defaultGiven the inherent unpredictability of demand for forensic services (which is heavily dependent on the nature, timing and number of individual cases), FSNI has, on occasion, accessed “spare” capacity in other 
defaultUK
default jurisdictions.  FSNI has been affected by the closure of the FSS and the state of the commercial market in 
defaultEngland
default and 
defaultWales
default, especially when seeking to broker excess demand to other providers.
defaultFSNI’s awareness of the situation in 
defaultEngland
default and 
defaultWales
default is also informed by membership of the Association of Forensic Science Providers (AFSP) as well as involvement with the Regulator’s Forensic Science Advisory Council (FSAC) and its various sub-groups.  
defaultFSNI is not aware of a cohesive strategy for forensic science for 
defaultEngland
default &amp; 
defaultWales
default, or of any consideration of the impact of the closure of the FSS on the rest of the 
defaultUK
default, including 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default.  The Forensic 21 initiative “
defaultaims to provide an agile and flexible response to the changing demands of the police service through the delivery of effective business change” in relation to forensics. However, it adopts a policing perspective rather than a comprehensive strategy addressing the scientific ethos of forensics or the wider ramifications for the delivery of justice across all parts of the 
defaultUK
default.
defaultThe substantial reduction in the commercially contestable market (through reduced expenditure on forensic services and police in-housing of services) may destabilise the market in the medium/long term.  In generic marketing terms, a shrinking market with falling profit margins is not usually attractive and consideration needs to be given to sustaining market attractiveness for providers. 
defaultThe forensic market is relatively small, uncertain in terms of continuity, high cost in terms of capital investment and skilled staff and high risk in terms of potential negative exposure. Yet the procurement approach adopted appears to have been geared to creating a commodity market rather than an added-value market.  For example, it is understood that the procurement approach has reduced costs for some volume crime forensic work (which is more linear and less integrated in nature and less robustly contested in court), but there are indications that the high-end national capacity and capability, especially for complex cases such as serious crime and terrorism, has been threatened.
defaultA report by the US Academy of Sciences (Strengthening Forensic Science in the 
defaultUS
default: A Path Forward: 2009) recommended the separation of forensic provision from the investigating authority (police) for reasons of quality management and cognitive/selection bias. The in-housing of forensic services within police forces would seem to run counter to that recommendation.
default&#xa0;
default2. Did the FSS transition and closure run smoothly and within budget? defaultWe are not sufficiently aware of the internal processes and budgets of the FSS transition to make a meaningful comment.  We are aware, however, about some general concerns expressed within the wider forensic science community that the closure of FSS did not run smoothly.  It is not clear, for example, how decisions were made around in-housing some services and building police laboratories. 
default&#xa0;
default3. What impacts have the FSS’s closure had on (i) the criminal justice system and (ii) forensic science R&amp;D and training? In particular, have the appropriate quality standards and accreditation been rigorously maintained? (please provide evidence/examples) default(i) The reduction in national capacity caused by the closure of FSS has affected FSNI’s ability to broker excess work at peak demand periods and reduced the Agency’s resilience and ability to meet its turnaround times. 
defaultThe increased reliance on police in-house forensics (unless systematically and structurally mitigated) also potentially increases the risk of cognitive or selection bias in relation to the exhibits selected for forensic examination, the choice of examinations conducted or not conducted on them and the subsequent objective evaluation of the evidence. 
defaultIn the interests of justice, forensic evaluation reports often need to be caveated in the light of such issues.  As outlined above, the 2009 US Academy of Sciences report recommended the operational independence of forensic science laboratories from the investigating authority (police).  We are unaware of any strategic consideration of this operational independence issue during the FSS transition and the drive to in-house services within police forces. Quality Accreditation, with its mandatory self-critical approach, including peer reviews, quality audits, case assessments etc. is highly relevant, especially when much in-housing was, as we understand it, carried out in the absence of any quality accreditation. 
defaultThere are also concerns on the related issue of the ability of a commercial provider to request additional (potentially exculpatory) exhibits or examinations in the interests of justice (and in so doing increase their own revenues) whilst still being accepted as completely objective.  
defaultThere were also some indications of distortion in cost comparisons between in-housing (without accreditation) versus external provision (with full accreditation). Additional costs are associated with accreditation fees but more significantly with the workings of a good quality management system, such as peer reviews, internal audits, blind trials etc. which are essential in preserving the integrity and objectivity of the science. Such quality on-costs are significant.
default(ii)  FSS was a recognised world leader in R&amp;D.  FSNI was collaborating with FSS on R&amp;D in several areas at the time of the closure announcement. With the closure of FSS, the burden of R&amp;D falls largely on commercial providers. However, with the contestable market having shrunk and with profit margins squeezed by the procurement process, there is little incentive for investment by the commercial companies in R&amp;D, especially given the high capital costs and restructuring costs associated with the relatively short procurement contracts. 
defaultWe would have some initial concerns regarding the proposed approach to R&amp;D for forensics, as outlined by the UK Technology Strategy Board’s FoSci Special Interest Group presentation to AFSP.  
default&#xa0;default4.  What should be role of the Forensic Science Regulator? defaultIt could be argued that the regulator’s remit should be wider than quality 
defaultper se
default, as the design and functioning of the market present a risk, in their own right, to the future provision of forensic science within the 
defaultUK
default. 
default&#xa0;
default5.  What is the size of the forensics market and how stable is it?defaultWe understand the market to have reduced to ca £170m p.a. in terms of police expenditure, of which only some is commercially contestable (i.e. not in-house). The market size is very small in comparative terms and given its dynamics and barriers to entry, it is by no means certain that it will remain attractive to current or potential providers. The high costs of bidding for contracts (in terms of capital investment in labs, staff etc.) act as disincentives, as does the somewhat commoditised nature of the procurement approach. 
defaultForensic science is not primarily a commodity service, except in those few disciplines based on lower value, standardised, straightforward, high volume processes (and even then only in the testing, as distinct from the evaluation aspects, 
defaultviz 
defaultDNA). It is in essence a technical business-to-business market.  Such markets normally function best where value is added to the business processes of the buyer through partnership working and is reflected in healthy margins and long term relationships for the providers, thus incentivising them to further develop their services for mutual benefit. There is limited evidence that such a market dynamic has developed and there is a significant risk of an exit from the market by one or more providers, which would further reduce national capacity and capability.   
defaultThis issue is compounded by the lack of any economic model that links forensic expenditure to monetary and other benefits in police investigations, criminal justice processes, or societal outcomes related to the improved detection, investigation and deterrence of crime facilitated by improved forensics. In the absence of such a model, commoditisation of the market through the dominance of direct cost to the police becomes the default.   
default&#xa0;default6.  How are forensic science services procured by police forces and could procurement processes be improved? defaultFSNI do not bid for procurement contracts with police forces in 
defaultEngland
default and 
defaultWales
default. However, short-term contracts are by their nature destabilising in a service requiring reliable local accessible presence by competent suppliers. In addition, the use of commoditised procurement approaches does not incentivise added value. 
defaultHowever, an alternative model could be constructed whereby a number of providers could simultaneously supply a competitive range of services within one region, with the market share of each being determined, over time, by the quality and overall cost-effectiveness of the services they continue to provide. It would generally be sensible to assign work on one case (or set of related cases) to a single provider to avoid fragmentation of the forensics and the individual case management. This approach might help create a more genuine added-value market and one for which providers would be better incentivised to invest in service improvement over the longer term.     
default&#xa0;
default7.  Has the closure of the FSS resulted in a loss of intellectual wealth through its scientists leaving the forensic science profession, or the defaultUKdefault? (please provide evidence/examples) defaultIt is not possible for us to comment definitively on this. However, it would be surprising if a significant number of highly skilled and experienced scientists - observing a shrinking market with, as they perceive it, a reduced appreciation of their expertise and added value and with less long-term job security -  would not be incentivised to look to other scientific opportunities for their future careers.    We are aware of some highly experienced former FSS employees setting up private consultancy services but cannot comment upon the numbers involved or the longer-term viability of the services.
default&#xa0;
default8.  Are current arrangements for the FSS’s archives satisfactory? How could arrangements for the retention of case files and forensic materials in the defaultUKdefault be improved?defaultWe are not close enough to the detail to comment. 
default 
defaultHowever, in addition to the archives themselves, there is the issue of the corporate memory of FSS having been lost, including personal “ownership” of case files with staff leaving the organisation. This may present difficulties in revisiting cold or historic cases.
