[normal]This submission draws on published findings from the Annual

[normal]a 
[normal]recent 
[normal]paper
[normal] that Ofsted commissioned
[normal] looking at
[normal] the educational attainment of White British students from low income background
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal] It also draws on Ofsted’s
[normal] f
[normal]orthcoming good practice report

[normal]No Child Left Unseen: successful practice in raising the attainment and progress of pupils from low income families
[normal], 
[normal]as well as internal analyses of outcomes data and inspection reports.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Much of the 
[normal]data 
[normal]analysis in this submission
[normal] is based on 
[normal]academic outcomes for
[normal] those 
[normal]pupils that were
[normal] eligible for free school meals, known as ‘FSM’
[normal], up to an
[normal]d
[normal] including 2012
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]In this submission, these pupils are referred to as ‘disadvantaged’ or from low 
[normal]income backgrounds.

[normal]Ofsted’s

[normal]school 
[normal]inspection framework 
[normal]was
[normal] strengthen
[normal]ed
[normal] further 
[normal]in September 2012 
[normal]to ensure 
[normal]that the achievement of 
[normal]specific 
[normal]groups of pupils, 
[normal]especially 
[normal]those pupils in receipt of support through the pupil premium, 
[normal]is at the v
[normal]ery heart of an inspecto
[normal]r’s judgements. I
[normal]t is now harder for schools to be judged good or outstanding where the achievement of disadvantaged pupils is below that of other pupils.

[normal]Deprivation is based on the Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index (IDACI) 2010. The deprivation of a provider is 
[normal]based on the mean of the deprivation indices associated with the home post codes of the pupils attending the school rather than the location of the school itself. The schools are divided into five equal groups (quintiles) that are labelled from ‘most depri
[normal]ved’ to ‘least deprived’.
