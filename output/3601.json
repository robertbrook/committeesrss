Before I engage with the witnesses, I want to make a few points. The Members of the Committee with relevant interests will declare these now. Does anybody have a relevant interest? We always seem to skirt over this one. I take it \nthat \nthey have not. The session is on record and is being webcast live and will be subsequently accessible via the parliamentary website. The witnesses will receive a transcript of the session to check and correct and this will be put on the public record in printed form and on the parliamentary website. For the record, would each of the witnesses begin by stating their names and official titles?\nProfessor Maguire: My name is Sue Maguire. I am a professorial fellow at the Centre for Education and Industry at the \nUniversity\n of \nWarwick\n.\nProfessor Sloman: My name is Martyn Sloman. I am a visiting professor at \nKingston\n \nUniversity\n and an extraordinary professor \nat \nNorth-West University\n, \nSouth Africa\n.\nDr Copeland: My name is Paul Copeland and I am lecturer of public policy at Queen Mary in \nLondon\n.\nThe Chairman: Thank you very much. Does anybody want to make an opening statement before we go into the questions? Lord Brooke, you have the first question.\nQ16 &#xa0; \nLord Brooke of Alverthorpe: Welcome. Good afternoon and thank you for the written evidence that we have had, which is interesting. One of the problems that I have in trying to get to the heart of this issue is the terminology in the field of unemployment, which to an outsider can be somewhat ambiguous. What do you think is meant by youth unemployment as opposed to worklessness and the other category of NEET that is increasingly used throughout the whole of Europe as well as the \nUK\n? For example, if a young person has left school with no job and is then put by a government programme on to a short-term training scheme, where do they crop up in these figures? What are the real figures and how do we get a better understanding about the real unemployed?\nProfessor Maguire: You have picked up on a very key issue. If we are famous for anything in \nBritain\n, we are famous for defining the term NEET. We created the term and it was created in the late 1990s following concern about the growing number of young people whose destination was unknown. Prior to 1988, all young people in \nEngland\n were eligible for income support or unemployment benefit when they left school. That was terminated in 1988, so 16 to 18\n \nyear-olds were no longer classified as unemployed. The only group of young unemployed that we had were the post-18 group and they were young people who were claiming benefit and actively seeking work. We had this group of young people who were operating under the radar and who had no official connection to any agency. Towards the end of the 1990s there was growing concern about this unknown group and who they were and, more critically, how many there were. Their official status was zero in the unemployment camp because they were not classified as unemployed. So we coined the term NEET\n—\nnot in education, employment or training\n—\nto get a handle on this population of under-18s who were not participating in education, employment or training. \nThe distinction is very much, in my mind, that the under-18s were NEET and the over-18s were those who could claim benefit and were actively seeking work. Those two definitions have become rather blurred and the NEET definition is used now more widely to incorporate both young people who are actively seeking work, the unemployed, and the non-active group, the NEET group. Within that NEET group, we now have over a million young people in \nEngland\n. \nW\ne have these strange definitions and terms, but if we want a classification of just unemployed, they are the young people who are actively seeking work and are claiming benefit. The NEET group are far more difficult to quantify in number and purpose.\nThe Chairman: Just for clarification, the NEET group, as you now describe them, do not get benefit. They could be looking for work, of course.\nProfessor Maguire: Of course they could, yes. The unemployed are a sub-group of the NEET group. We have half a million in \nEngland\n who are unemployed and the rest are classified as inactive. We have “actively seeking” but that is a much more accurate count because they are counted in the unemployment statistics.\nThe Chairman: They are registered in the \nj\nobcentres and so on?\nProfessor Maguire: They would be registered in the \nj\nobcentres and within the labour force survey. When the labour force survey is conducted, they declare themselves as actively seeking work. The inactive group are far more difficult and the problem of quantifying them is greatest within the 16 to 18 group because they have no natural entitlement to income support until the age of 18.\nLord Brooke of Alverthorpe: Do you think it is important from society’s viewpoint that we should find some mechanism whereby we can stick with them and know of their existence, where they are, what they are doing? Has anybody done any academic work to try to follow a cohort of them for a number of years to assess their cost to society or to themselves in terms of health, perhaps criminality or other areas of social problems that might arise from being in that category? I \ndo not wish\n to blame anybody in any sense, because a lot of people have problems that lead to the difficulties they encounter, but I wonder whether we follow through what the true cost is when we start talking about them not having anything at all from the state when in fact they are costing the state a lot.\nProfessor Maguire: The figures for the unknown group were very small\n,\n but over the last couple of years they are rocketing because the infrastructure has been withdrawn to map the NEET population. So we have a growing problem with the unknown group and who they are or what they are. We cannot assume that they are NEET\n,\n but we do not actually know who they are. \nS\nome work \nwas \ndone a couple of years ago by the \nUniversity\n of \nYork\n and the \nNational \nAudit Office looking at the cost to society of being NEET, so the costs of being NEET have been quantified.\nQ17 &#xa0; \nLord Brooke of Alverthorpe: Do you have any ideas about \nwhether it would \nbe right that we should try to track them, as we could prior to 1988?\nProfessor Maguire: I think it is crucial that we track them\n,\n because if we lose young people and they have a destination unknown at the age of 16, we know from the figures that they emerge at the age of 18, having been lost for two years. They turn up at 18 because they can claim benefit and in our eyes they have been left for two years with nothing to do. The problem is far greater to fix if you have left someone for two years, or perhaps longer, than if there is instant intervention at 16 and they are supported and tracked and monitored through the system. We have disturbing numbers of unknown. I have some figures with me that show that the unknown figures since 2010 have doubled or trebled in some areas.\nThe Chairman: Would it be possible for you to send them to us?\nProfessor Maguire: I will send the figures to you.\nThe Chairman: Thank you very much. Prof\nessor Sloman, would you like to \nadd to that?\nProfessor Sloman: Can I defer first to Dr Copeland? I think \nthis \nis a little more \nin \nhis area\n. I will \nthen I come back, if I \nmay\n.\nDr Copeland: Here is hoping. Maybe I should mention this definition of worklessness or joblessness. This is an interesting one and is even more recent than the NEET classification. Worklessness is an EU-wide definition\n,\n and within the literature you will see a flipping between worklessness and joblessness\n,\n \nbut \nit actually means the same thing. The definition here is individuals who are working less than 16 hours a week, so these individuals are still employed albeit working part-time or below 16 hours a week. The definition of worklessness or jobless households, for example, very much features in Europe 2020, the EU’s new reform strategy and successor to the \nLisbon\n agenda, which attempts to define poverty as individuals living in jobless households and is supposed to pick up on issues of economic inactivity. \nThe problem with the definition is twofold. One is that individuals are still working, albeit for 16 hours or less a week, and the second is that the definition itself picks up all economically inactive people, such as those on disability benefits and pensioners. There is a real problem with using a worklessness or joblessness definition to look at the youth unemployment problem. It does not give you an accurate picture of what is really happening out there.\nProfessor Sloman: Could I make some general comments first, my Lord Chair? I was very pleased to be invited here\n,\n but perhaps I should position myself. I am basically a training manager in organisations. That is what I have come through. I have held director roles as head of training in organisations, so I have looked at this problem from a slightly different perspective \nfrom\n the definitions. I would make two very general observations and point you in the direction of something. \nFirst of all, this is about the most confused area \nfor \nvocabulary that it is possible to look at. The definitions of categories\n \nseem to vary. Y\nou cannot tie them down, and there are multiple schemes and acronyms, all with strange-sounding names. My view is that you have to define the problem before you can comment on the solution. The challenge facing us is\n whether \nthe problem \nis \none of youth inactivity, a problem of a lost generation, or a problem of a lack of skills for the future through training\n.\n Those are quite different problems\n,\n but we need to determine which of those we want. With the metrics reporting and definition, it is more important to start with the problem than \nto \ntry to drill down through definitions. \nSomething that attracted my attention when I was looking at this problem was a Local Government Association report called \nHidden Talents\n. \nT\nhat argued, very powerfully, for a scorecard for local areas, if you could agree a scorecard, because you have three \ngovernment departments\n, Education, Business, Innovation and Skills\n,\n and DWP, each producing different figures and definitions and each focusing on different areas. I fear that is not an answer to your question but I hope it is an observation that might help the Committee.\nQ18 &#xa0; \n \nLord Cotter: You have spoken about skills\n,\n and this is something that is raised time and time again when people come to Parliament\n—\nthe lack of engineers and the lack of having anticipated this years back\n—\nand it can be very much applied to youngsters who perhaps need to roll their sleeves up and do things.\nProfessor Sloman: We have a very important dialogue going on in this country about the skills of young people at present\n,\n and it is very hard to disentangle it. Again, I do not know \nwhether\n this helps the Committee or not. I live in \nNorfolk\n, and \nNorwich\n is the nearest place. We have a very serious structural problem there, and it is not untypical. In the 1930s, 30% of girls and 25% of boys went into the boot and shoe industries in \nNorwich\n, so you could talk about the skills of boots and shoes. That has totally disappeared. Last week in the \nEastern Daily Press\n, which is our local newspaper, the head of Start-rite—I do not know \nwhether\n you remember Start-rite, the children’s shoes that used to be made in Norwich—\nsaid that\n he would like to bring it back to Norfolk if he could but at present they are mainly manufacturing in Portugal and Italy, I think from memory, or it might be Portugal and Spain. Are we going to invest in boot and shoe skills in \nNorwich\n in the hope that something happens? The answer, of course, is no. \nW\ne need to get our young people into work as quickly as possible because it is work that produces the skills. People learn skills from work. I can expand on this by all means. What we have at present in \nNorfolk\n, which is occupying a lot of my time, is a totally bogus propaganda campaign without any substance, \nNorwich\n for Jobs, which masks the real problem. The real problem is not enough jobs at present in the English economy for young school leavers who are not sure what they want to do, and who does at 16. Does that help?\nLord Cotter: Very much, thank you.\nThe Chairman: I was going to ask you when \nthe issue of\n skills came up, because surely it has been for\n \never thus, right from the beginning of the 20\nth \ncentury. How did people become motor mechanics, because there were no motor cars? The skills had to follow the new inventions. I keep coming back to the point that nowadays we say \nthat \nwe are in the digital age\n and \nIT is supposed to be the great answer to everything, but the IT skills are more talked about than real and there is a huge gap of people \nwho claim to be skilled and those \nwho are truly skilled in IT. I think this is one of those things that people could major on. \nThe\n clerk has just \nasked \nwhat we think are the most helpful statistics to look at when we are considering the whole issue of youth unemployment\n.\n We are being bombarded by statistics from everywhere. Can I ask the three of you not necessarily to give us the answer to that now but to think about it and see if you can help us through this? Maybe it is OECD, maybe it is the British Government, maybe it is a red book or a green book or a yellow book or something, but we really need to know because I think we are in danger of confusing and comparing unlike with like, so to speak. That is just as an aside.\nQ19 &#xa0; \nBaroness Hooper: On that issue—I realise this might come up later on the question about the historical situation—there was a time when with national service all young men went into the \nA\nrmy and very often they learnt a skill in that way. Nobody is going to reintroduce national service, I suspect, but perhaps there could be some sort of community service, as in \nSwitzerland\n and other countries, that could fill that sort of gap. Is this being looked at at all?\nProfessor Maguire: There is a national citizenship programme that was launched a couple of years ago that offers young people citizenship training over the summer period.\nBaroness Hooper: That is not a skill.\nProfessor Maguire: It is just a programme.\nThe Chairman: A social service \ninitiative?\nProfessor Maguire: I think there is huge potential. If we think about the numbers of ageing in society and the growing loneliness that is reported, we have all these people who are in need and all these young people with the capacity to give. It does not seem a bridge too far to join them together.\nLord Kakkar: I find this a rather interesting discussion and I just want to be clear. Are we saying that there is no clear definition of this problem at a European level? If that is the case, how can you have reasonable policy and determine \nwhether \nthat policy is being effective if you do not have a clear definition of the problem and are unable to see whether that policy is actually affecting the numbers if they are changed from time to time because the definition changes?\nDr Copeland: There is an EU-wide definition of youth unemployment that captures individuals from 15 to 24. An issue is that some countries, even the \nUK\n, will give slightly different age parameters. In the \nUK\n it is 16 to 24, I believe. \nW\nhat normally happens \nwith \nEU documentation is that they differentiate between youth unemployment and NEETs, just to show you some of the variation and the problems within those statistics. \nA\nt EU level \nI think \nthere is an awareness of these problems that we are talking about\n, b\nut in terms of EU policy and how that affects member states, the EU’s role is very much to guide member states to their own solutions, so there is no\n \ntop-down, homogenous way of doing things.\nThe Chairman: I have just been reminded that Professor Maguire could probably give us a quick answer about the best statistics to look for.\nProfessor Maguire: The statistics that I would look at for the \nUK\n are the ONS statistics. The most recent were published in August. They give our figures for 16 to 24\n year-olds\n. There is a statistical bulletin that is published every three or four months. I can send you the link. They would be the figures that I would use.\nThe Chairman: Thank you very much for that, and thank you for reminding me that we should get the answer now.\nQ20 &#xa0; \n \nLord Fearn: In your view, what is the\n nature of the current problems \nwith respect to youth unemployment across \nEurope\n? Are the key concerns related to the numbers, who is affected\n,\n and where are they located across \nEurope\n?\nDr Copeland: I may overlap between questions 2 and 3 here, so do excuse me\n,\n but I see them as linked. I think it is important to note that youth unemployment is not a recent problem or \na \nrecent phenomenon. Back in 1994 the European Commission noted that youth unemployment across the EU stood at 20%, so that is quite high. Of course, in the early 1990s we had the recession\n, b\nut when you compare the EU to its then main competitors in the early 1990s, the \nUSA\n and \nJapan\n, \nEurope\n has had a long-term youth unemployment problem. If we take the current situation in the \nUK\n where youth unemployment is at approximately 20%, and we look back at the 20-year period, we will see that 10 years prior to 2008 it was still at 10%, so it is still considerably higher than the then level of general unemployment. \nWhy exactly is this the case? I am of the persuasion that that 10%, that kind of drag on unemployment, is a complex problem. It is for numerous variables to explain this situation, so it is not just a case of individuals with poor training skills. There may also be some social issues involved in that problem. \nThe reasons are \nclearly not the same as \nin \nsome other European countries. Our current level of youth unemployment, although it has increased, has not increased as much as other European countries. Our long-term rate of youth unemployment has not been as high as some European countries. When we look across the EU, we see that long term it is the Mediterranean countries that have had a problem here, and we include \nFrance\n within the discussion. These Mediterranean countries have had much higher levels of youth unemployment than the \nUK\n and this is because they have often operated dual labour markets, so younger generations find themselves on contracts that are less generous than older generations. It is much easier to dismiss a young person off these contracts\n,\n so younger generations get made redundant much more easily. They have this dual labour market system. \nWe started from a situation before the crisis where youth unemployment was high already\n,\n and it has increased since 2008, but we think of the problem countries as being those in the \nMediterranean\n because of the downturn. The problem in the \nUK\n is similar in the sense that youth unemployment has sky rocketed because there \nis \na lack of jobs. We can talk all day about skills, and skills are fundamentally important, but if you train and retrain the \nUK\n’s young and there is no job waiting for them at the end\n, \nthis is just a waste of money. If you look at northern European countries since 2008, the economies of the Scandinavian countries, \nGermany\n and \nAustria\n have boomed and their youth unemployment has fallen. I think that serves as a good indicator of the real problem. We have an issue of skills but we have an issue of a lack of jobs\n,\n so you have to take a much broader and more holistic perspective on the problem.\nThe Chairman: Is there not a mismatch? Not everybody who is unemployed can go into these jobs. There are an awful lot of employers looking for people but they cannot take them because they do not have the skills, so it is the mismatch between what the employers think these people are capable of and whether they are capable of being trained in a period of, say, three or four months.\nDr Copeland: I think \nthat \nlong term there is some mismatch\n,\n but I do not agree that there \nhas been \nsuch a mismatch since 2008. In some instances there have been over 100 applications for one single job. That is not a mismatch of skills\n; t\nhat is a lack of jobs in the economy.\nThe Chairman: Can I follow that one through? We all know the story about the 5,000 people who applied to Rolls-Royce in \nDerby\n to get apprenticeships. It is not that they could not get jobs elsewhere but they have targeted Rolls-Royce because they know that they are going to get terrific training and great skills. That does not mean that all those 5,000 people are not going to get jobs elsewhere. They have just all focused on Rolls-Royce.\nDr Copeland: I still think those numbers are ridiculously high\n:\n 5,000 applications for one job.\nThe Chairman: That is what we have been told.\nProfessor Sloman: Apprenticeship\ns\n \nare\n something I know a \ngreat \ndeal about. That 5,000 is right because it is a very well known, attractive scheme and you would get that. A well\n \nstructured apprenticeship scheme wherever will get eight or nine applicants, and probably more, for every position. One of the things that concerns me, and I want to put this on \nthe \nrecord—I do not know \nwhether \nit is permissible to produce written material afterwards but I would certainly be keen to do so on this point\n—\nThe Chairman: Yes, \nplease\n.\nProfessor Sloman: \nWhat concerns me is that w\ne are using loose vocabulary to define a problem. On Monday last week the Government announced \ntheir \nnew policies on apprenticeships, or at least half of them, and that word is now losing its meaning. The word “apprentice” no longer means what it is considered to be in popular parlance. My father was an apprentice. He was a coachbuilder apprentice\n for \nfive years. He started off on very limited pay, went through and left with a transferable skill that could be taken anywhere else. \nNow, \nthe term “apprenticeship” \nis being \nused to describe a job with training in a framework defined by the employer. I used to run the graduate investment banking training scheme for NatWest Markets. I could easily, on that definition, call it an apprenticeship and increase the figures. We are setting a target, \narbitrarily\n, for the number of apprenticeships, believing that we are solving the problem\n,\n or, bluntly, pretending that we are solving the problem. \nThe most depressing thing is that the announcement last Monday, which was one of the most significant and important announcements in skills training in \nBritain\n, passed without any public debate or any mention in the newspapers. It was not mentioned on the news, it did not feature in the serious papers, and yet \nit \nis the most profound change in our attitude to skills training in \nBritain\n.\nProfessor Maguire: I think there are two causes of youth unemployment. It is either down to structural changes or a labour queue hypothesis. Structural changes to the youth labour market were most dramatic in this country in the late 1980s\n and \n1990s when the manufacturing sector diminished\n,\n and therefore the traditional youth labour market that existed for school leavers was decimated. That damage to the youth labour market has never been repaired because that infrastructure does not exist. \nA\nfter that \nwe went towards \nencouraging increasing numbers of young people to remain in full\n-\ntime education as an alternative to finding work. I think we are picking up the consequences of those policies now. \nWe are talking about a broad spectrum of 16 to 24\n year-olds\n, including graduates and young people\n,\n who are leaving learning without basically literacy and numeracy, so we cannot group them all together. They have very specific needs and very different skill levels. I think we have to be quite honest here and say that we have not had a real commitment to placing young people in employment for many years, particularly the younger groups. The focus has been on increasing rates in \nfull-time\n learning\n,\n and it is only when young people have emerged from that and that has coincided with a recession that we are suddenly screaming about youth unemployment. I think we have to be honest and say that that has not been a policy priority in this country and in many other countries, unlike \nGermany\n, which has \nalways sustained a healthy apprenticeship programme that is well supported and as such ha\ns\n never experienced high levels of youth unemployment since the war.\nThe Chairman: That is very useful indeed and very sobering. \nQ21 &#xa0; \n \nEarl of Liverpool: I refer to an earlier point made by Dr Copeland\n. \nI believe you said \nthat \nthere is a severe shortage of jobs available. This comes back to the confused mixed messages we are getting within this Select Committee. Mr W\nells\n from the Department \nfor\n Business, Innovation and Skills told us something very different last week. He said, “One of the things I should say is that our labour market is sufficiently flexible that there are jobs for everybody in the sense that there is a very dynamic and diverse range. It is actually quite difficult to regard someone as unemployable because the range of jobs in the \nUK\n is quite great\n”.\n How do we square this circle?\nDr Copeland: \nIn the \nUK\n we have \nissue \nwith skills, \nand retraining is necessary. I strongly believe, however, that since 2008, if you look at the statistics, there has \nabsolutely \nbeen a shortage of jobs. For example, research published in April 2013 by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills was rather critical of the lack of lending for small and medium-sized enterprises since 2008. I wonder \nwhether \nanybody has \nactually \nspoken to anyone between 16 and 24 years-old and asked them about their experiences of employment or trying to get a job, whether they are 18 or after university. I have very first-hand experience of graduates trying to get a job within the sector that I am employed in and I can tell you they face much more difficulty now than they did five years ago. \nIn any kind of analysis of youth unemployment, we can look at the statistics but we also need qualitative accounts of individual experiences, and there is a north-south divide. It is much easier to find a job in the south-east then it is up north. Spend a day in \nManchester\n or Sheffield and you will soon see that the disparities are huge and that if you are a young person in those cities you face much more difficulty than you do in somewhere like \nLondon\n.\nProfessor Sloman: Can I add something on that? It is not simply a north-south d\nivide. It is also a rural-city\n divide as well. I live in rural \nNorfolk\n. I do not know who your expert witness from the Department \nfor\n Business, Innovation and Skills was but I would very much welcome him to visit north \nNorfolk\n. First of all, young people are now entirely dependent on getting to work by some sort of transport, which is enormously difficult anyway. The key thing for them is passing their driving test and having someone who has the money to give them a car, because there is no transport.\nLord Brooke of Alverthorpe: And pay for the insurance.\nProfessor Sloman: And pay for the insurance, absolutely right. Yes, that is the big thing. In our little market town, there is a computer shop and I have got to know the fine young woman who is working there. She has a 2:1 \ndegree \nin criminology and wanted to work with young offenders, and if there is one thing we are not short of it is young offenders. There is plenty of material there for her to work with. She has a record of applying for 20, 30, 40 jobs. Famously she tells the story of applying for one job at Aviva Norwich Union at 6\n o’clock\n one evening and getting an automatic response back at 8 am the following morning from the computer telling her she was not good enough. She has been in touch with the probation service in Norfolk to try to get voluntary work in that area and she says \nthat \nthe problem has been that they are so overwhelmed with young people trying to get job experiences of any sort that the probation service is unable to cope with sorting between people who have some particular interest, a law background or interest in working with young people, and decent young people who are just desperate to get anything on their CV. \nThat is the situation that we are facing\n,\n and I firmly believe that it is a structural issue that is a reflection of the world economy and certain jobs going. It applies throughout the whole of \nEurope\n. It is more acute in places like Greece and Spain, we know that, and it is less acute in the Netherlands, Austria and Germany, we know that, but it is certainly, most disturbingly for us, a problem that is not moving at all in Britain. However you define it\n, \nand I do not have the expertise of my two colleagues\n, the significant thing about \nth\ne\n figure \nof 958,000 unemployed which \nSue referred to\n \nis that quarter on quarter it has shifted by 1,000 in 958,000. The 1,000 improvement was entirely in female unemployment. Male unemployment went up in that 16 to 24 category. That is correct, is it not?\nProfessor Maguire: Yes, but there is a hidden issue around that. It looks as though we have a particular problem with male youth unemployment but that is because we have 355,000 young women between the ages of 16 and 24 who are classified as NEET inactive, so they do not actually appear on the unemployment statistics at all, compared to a figure of 130,00\n0\n males. I find it very disturbing that a third of a million young women between the ages of 16 and 24 have been written off already and do not even appear on the unemployment statistics because they are classified as inactive, therefore they are not even picked up by the agencies and are eligible for the \nW\nork \nP\nrogramme or the youth contract. I find that quite disturbing.\nThe Chairman: It is indeed. A lot of what we have unearthed today seems to be disturbing, but we have to crack on a bit I am afraid.\nQ22 &#xa0; \n \nLord Wilson of Tillyorn: \nI wanted to follow up on that, but we are moving on. \nLooking for help from history, if we can, how does what we face now compare with historical experience, either in boom or bust times? Are there lessons that we ought to be able to learn from either good or bad times? When we are trying to look with our telescopes towards the future, is there anything \nthat \nwe can discern coming up in as a result of experience we have had in the past?\nProfessor Maguire: \nI think it is probably best to look back to \nthe late 1970s\n and \nearly 1980s when the huge structural changes occurred to the youth labour market. The intervention then was the youth training scheme, which we will all remember, probably, for its label of slave labour\n,\n offering young people pittance wages and employers exploiting them for six months\n,\n and things like that. I had the opportunity to look at the evaluation of the youth training scheme a few months ago\n,\n and I think \nthat \nif we had that amount of money and that amount of commitment now we would be rubbing our hands together with glee because it looks like a great programme compared to the opportunities and interventions that are being created for young people currently.\nWhat we need to learn from the 1980s experience is that we \nhad \nyoung people who were subject to long-term unemployment and the effects of that on their re-engagement and ability to find a job were long lasting. The idea of a scarring effect was born from that experience. If learn anything \nfrom that \nit would be that we should be intervening sooner rather than later\n,\n \nthat \nthose interventions should be employment training and education, not just one or the other, and that we should stop blaming young people for this problem. It is society’s problem and we should embrace it and not \nblame\n young people because they cannot find jobs. It is impossible for some young people to find jobs.\nLord Wilson of Tillyorn: Could you flesh out very briefly the youth training scheme? You say \nthat \nit was much abused at the time but \nthat \nactually we would love to have it now if we could. What were the key elements in it?\nProfessor Maguire: It was a point I made earlier\n:\n that at that time we were still tuned into the requirement that young people should find work rather than keeping them in learning\n,\n and therefore we understood employers’ needs much more, how they might use young people and in what kind of capacity. We had a much better grip of where young people fitted into the labour market. I am not certain that we would know that now. We know where they go \nto learn\n and we know what qualifications fit together, but I am certainly not convinced that we know where young people fit into the labour market in this country. I think we need some intelligence as a base in order to develop policy from that.\nProfessor Sloman: May I build on that a little? I agree with a lot of what Sue was saying\n,\n but I think \nthat \nwe are in a different situation from the situation historically\n \nbecause of structural changes in employment, particularly as they affect young people, and the sort of skills that people need at work are changing. This is one of the reasons, Lord Wilson, why so many young people who do find first jobs find them in either the retail sector or the hospitality sector where the skills needs are pretty easily recognisable, if I can put it that way without diminishing the high quality of training that go\nes\n on. I do not think we are going to find a solution in the current cocktail of policies or the traditional cocktail of policies. \nOne thing is certain now\n:\n we have far too many schemes. A Select Committee of the House of Commons looking at Jobcentre Plus had evidence from an expert witness who said \nthat \nthey had counted 48 separate schemes in the \nUK\n affecting youth unemployment. I \nread\n the minutes today and I can reference it. The Local Government Association has identified 35 separate schemes. I do not think there is going to be a solution \non \nschemes. I think we need more radical solutions now. \nWe need to understand, and we can, what drives employers’ training. I am quite happy to say a little more about that. I know a little about what determines that decision to train. I \nadvocate \nin fact a change in the Companies Act legislation. I do not think we will solve this problem without requiring companies to accept wider social obligations. That is pretty radical but that is where I am coming from.\nQ23 &#xa0; \nLord Wilson of Tillyorn: You have rejected a couple of cocktails. Your cocktail is a sort of single drink, the Companies Act?\nProfessor Sloman: No, it is not. I have a cocktail of four I can offer you. Very quickly, \nthey are \na change in the Companies Act, more devolution to local government because of the triple schemes,\n a change to the role of the UK\nCES towards honest reporting, and some sort of charter.\nLord Wilson of Tillyorn: Sorry, CES?\nProfessor Sloman: \nThe \nUK Commission for Employment and Skills, which has become the scheme promoter. I think we need more honest reporting. We need it to have the sort of role that the financial one has, an Office for Budget Responsibilit\ny-\ntype role. Finally, \nt\nh\nere should be \na charter. I will put these in writing.\nThe Chairman: That would be wonderful. I was about to ask you that and I \nwondered whether \nI \nhad \nthe nerve to \ndo so\n.\nProfessor Sloman: That was garbled. I apologise.\nThe Chairman: No, that is really helpful. Lord Wilson, do you have a supplementary\n question\n?\nLord Wilson of Tillyorn: I have, but do you want to say anything on the earlier point, Dr Copeland?\nDr Copeland: Yes, building on what my two colleagues have said\n. \nI will be brief. Sue was talking about the 1980s, but if we look at the 1990s as well we will see that the trends in statistics show some kind of hangover of youth unemployment that lasts for about eight to 10 years, so it can take a good decade for this to actually come down. \nT\nhe interesting thing about earlier peaks in youth unemployment and the current situation is that then we did not have welfare to work, which we do now, which I think has been successful in some respects in getting some individuals back into the labour market. \nThe problem I have when looking at youth unemployment and this idea that it will take about eight to 10 years for youth unemployment to come back down to its pre-recession level is the social consequences of that. We know that when individuals are outside the labour market for a long period, whether they be youth unemployed or general unemployed, they often need much more than something like A\n4e\n to get them back into work. There was discussion in the media last week that they could develop physical or mental health issues that cannot be tackled in the more conventional sense and they often require more social intervention. Thinking about this long term, we need to broaden the way that we look at getting people back into work. \nBaroness Hooper: May I pick up a point made by Professor Sloman when he said that we have far too many schemes? We are looking at EU action to tackle unemployment and we are talking about far too many schemes in the \nUK\n. If you look around the European Union as a whole, how many does that add up to and how are we finding out what is best practice in relation to what is going on in other countries?\nProfessor Sloman: As I understand the European youth guarantee and what they call the youth employment initiative, it is meant to be an umbrella commitment with local interpretation. \nT\nhat is probably the correct approach there, given the multitude of schemes that exist. As you can see, I am much more of a commentator than an academic, coming from a practitioner background. The problem is that we cannot say, “Would we not like to be like \nGermany\n was 50 years ago today?”\n,\n and build on that. \nGermany\n has achieved what \nit has \nthrough a variety of circumstances and accidents. Other countries have achieved what they have or what they \nhave \nfailed to achieve through a variety of schemes, but I think it comes down to something pretty basic, and this is where the 48 or the 35 schemes confuse. \nThere are three things. You can act on the supply side, which is \nthat \nyou can try to get more young people to have better skills to begin with, and that is a wide gamut\n: i\nt is maths and English, very specific skills, communication skills and technology skills. You can act on the demand side \nby \nsubsidising employers in some way or another to create more jobs, and the \nO\npposition \nare \ntalking about using public procurement. \nY\nou can do something on job matching, which is trying to ensure that there is a better match between the market, that the careers service works more effectively, that they get more careers advice, \nthat \nyou get businesses going into schools\n,\n and so on, so the market for clearing becomes more efficient. When it comes down to it, those are the three things \nthat \nyou are basically doing\n,\n and you can put \nin \nthe schemes on all that. \nWhere we have suffered is that we insist on overselling whatever the latest scheme\n is\n. They have stopped doing it now but I used to read the Business, Innovation and Skills regular update of the schemes\n,\n and in one month I counted the word “celebration” used\n 38 times: \n“We have celebrated the success of this scheme, we have celebrated the launch”. We have nothing to celebrate.\nThe Chairman: I think you have made that quite clear. It is a rather confused basket \nthat \nwe are looking at. We have to crack on because we have a lot to get through.\nQ24 &#xa0; \n \nLord Cotter: Thank you very much for your robust contributions. They are very welcome. \nThere are f\nar too many schemes. What do you think about the evidence from the Government suggesting that the position in the \nUK\n is rather better than the rest of \nEurope\n? Are the Government talking about our actions or the level of unemployment? You are saying a lot about the array of different initiatives. What do you think about this evidence from the Government that we are much better positioned? If so, in what way?\nProfessor Maguire: I do not think we should be celebrating the fact that we have 1.09 million young people who are classified as NEET and another percentage who we do not even know where they are. In particular, the latter is very worrying. Yes, we are not as bad as \nGreece\n and \nItaly\n but we have an unacceptable level of youth unemployment and we need some action\n. W\ne particularly need to tackle the younger age group, between the ages of 16 and 18, where the cuts in services mean that the entitlement to careers guidance and access to support for those young people who are NEET is of grave concern and hence why we have this growing unknown population. We need early intervention to curb a worrying trend of protracted lengths of youth unemployment. I do not think we have much to celebrate. We have a lot to act on.\nProfessor Sloman: All I would add is that we are mid-table in most of the OECD rankings, which if you are a \nNorwich\n \nCity\n supporter is pretty good going but it is not good news at all. What is worrying is that our situation is deteriorating and the raw figures are not shifting month on month. I keep coming back to that. Whatever we are doing, we are not moving that problem. \nY\nouth unemployment now is up there with the care of the elderly or affordable housing in the south-east, which is seen as a critical social problem affecting our development as a society that shows no sign of shifting.\nLord Cotter: I think the overselling of interventions is emerging. I have a strong feeling about the political overselling of things and you seem to be saying the same sort of thing. The youth guarantee scheme has one or two different points and a stable situation. Thank you very much for that. I do not know whether to ask you any more\n,\n but I think you have answered with what you have said up to now that perhaps we are overselling things and we need to be more stable and consider the points you are making.\nProfessor Sloman: We need to get a better information base too about what we are concerned about. Apprenticeships are a good example to take. The number of apprenticeships is going up\n,\n but do apprenticeships mean what they used to mean\n,\n and all those sorts of things. These become propaganda figures if we do not watch it.\nThe Chairman: Dr Copeland, were you about to say something?\nDr Copeland: No. For issues of time, I agree with what they—\nThe Chairman: No, come on.\nDr Copeland: I would like to reiterate the point \nabout \nthe Government saying that the \nUK\n position is rather better than the rest of \nEurope\n. Youth unemployment in \nGreece\n is 65%, so if you compare the \nUK\n situation of course it is much better but it is certainly not much better than other northern European countries, echoing the point \nmade by \nProfessor Sloman.\nQ25 &#xa0; \n \nEarl of Liverpool: Could you let us know your view on the effectiveness of the actions that have been taken at the EU level so far, such as the youth employment programme and the youth employment initiatives? Are there other ways in which the EU might take more effective action? Before you answer that, could I say \nthat \nI have read Dr Copeland’s very helpful report that you gave us before the meeting and, reading the last paragraph, I think you are \nprobably \ngoing to say something about supporting entrepreneurships.\nDr Copeland: In answer to the first part of the question about how effective have actions been so far at EU level, such as the youth employment programme and youth employment initiatives, I think it is too early to tell. These initiatives have only come forward in the last couple of years. I daresay \nthat \nin some member states they have not even been acted upon, so it is still too early to make a judgment on the outcomes of EU activity\n, b\nut I reiterate the point that the EU does not give a policy prescription here for what member states do with regard to youth policy. It \nvery much supports\n, whether it be by funding or the sharing of best practice, what is going on in that member state. \nA\nny EU initiative is then only as good as what is happening at each member state level and the activity and impetus at each member state level. \nI would say something else about EU activity since 2010. There is an awful of grumbling, particularly in the UK, about how much money the EU wastes—whether that is true or not is of course deb\natable—particularly when we think about funds for the common agricultural policy. Here we\n have an example of the EU ring-\nfencing €6 billion to do something to specifically help its vulnerable. I think the EU is doing something absolutely right here and is \nnot wasting money. Again, member states can do with that at local level how they see fit as long it fits within the parameters of what is prescribed. \nAre there other ways in which the EU might take more effective action? This is a tricky one because the EU is constrained in what it can do for EU youth policy. We can come up with all sorts of amazing ideas of what the €6 billion could do, but according to the treaty it can only spend the money on education and training. Articles 50 and 126 of the treaty spe\ncify that the EU can play a co-ordinating role for youth and education. With the recent initiatives, the \nC\nommission and the EU itself has very much fitted in with that legal framework\n,\n so we struggle when we want to go beyond it. \nOne idea that I thought would fit in with that framework and could complement some of the activities at EU level is building on some of the initiatives that the EU has done in the structural funds with regard to hub activities, specifically focusing on the EU’s young and helping them to set up their own businesses. That is one thing the EU could do and should do more. We have seen that lending to small and medium-sized enterprises has contracted massively. That is where a lot of jobs and growth will come from in the economy\n,\n and there are a considerable number of young people out there who may have ideas and may want to set up their own business\n,\n but the resources are quite limited. You could package that in terms of training and so forth. That is one possibility.\nEarl of Liverpool: Are you saying that that is not currently possible within the remit of what the European Union \nis \nsaying \nit is \ntrying to do with education and training?\nDr Copeland: I believe that \nwithin \nthe education and training remit, the recent initiatives of the EU are not doing that to tackle this youth unemployment problem. In the past the structural funds have funded particular regional activities for these hubs, \nwhich are \nusually located close to universities to set up entrepreneurial activities, but I believe \nthat \nit has not targeted it towards the current set of problems.\nThe Chairman: Following on directly from Lord Liverpool\n’s question\n, we have known about this €6 billion up to 2016 and then €8 billion to 2020 for a very long time, at least it seems a very\n long time, but we have had very little information about how \nm\nuch of it has been spent, what has been done with it and what the results are.\nProfessor Sloman: Can I try to clarify a bit and test my understanding? In preparation for this, I tried to dig a little deeper from my position. As I understand it—and I know you have had evidence from the \nd\nepartment—they have to present an implementation plan by Christmas. This is the key thing. They are very helpful at the \nC\nommission. They have sent me all the documents on the implementation plan, the templates that you have to put your material in, and it covers a wide variety of headings. I am interested from a professional point of view now \nin \nhow much variance there will be if they publish those implementation plans, different approaches being used across \nEurope\n. It is too early to judge the effectiveness of that. \nIf I can pick up the Earl of Liverpool’s question, one thing I would like to see that could be done at European level—and I defer to my professional colleagues on all this—is some sort of protection for the young employee in charter terms. One of the effects of these famous 48\n,\n 35 or however many schemes is \nthat \nthere is \nplenty of evidence now of small-\nscale abuse\n,\n and when there is it is quite serious and disturbing. We have a labour market for young people where employers can take advantage, and there is anecdotal evidence and precise evidence. Let me give you just two\n examples\n. Jobs have been advertised on the Government’s National Apprenticeship Service website at below the minimum wage. This is well documented and I will put it in my evidence. Another employer, whose name you will all recognise, advertised on the National Apprenticeship Service for a 37\n \nhour\n \na\n \nweek trainee unpaid. I think we are at the stage where generally we ought to be thinking about some sort of charter or protection for young workers.\nThe Chairman: Yes. I am sure you are right. Do you feel that the response at \nUK\n level, such as the youth contract and payment by results in the w\nelfare to work area, is pointing in the same direction as EU initiatives, as other member states’ initiatives?\nProfessor Maguire: I do not think they are, no. The youth guarantee is giving an offer of a job or training place within six months and the €6 billion has to be applauded as a step in the right direction for tackling youth unemployment. Whether that is enough is debatable. I would bring the Committee back to a point I made earlier, which is that you can only give somebody an offer of a job or a tra\nining place or an education place if you know they exist, so I think we have to get a handle on the population and be in touch with the whole population in order to implement that policy. In my view, the offer of a job or training is not enough. We have to support and protect young people to make sure that those transitions are sustained, and I think that is where we move on to look at the youth contract in this country. \nI am involved in the evaluation of the youth contract for 16 and 17\n year-olds\n and it is not just about engaging young people\n; it is about \nsupporting their transitions into a successful outcome and for six months beyond that so that they are sustained in that outcome, because we know that particularly among the vulnerable groups within the NEET population there is a high churn, that they are prone to drop out. There will be churn, so we need more than an offer. We need sustained intervention and I think the youth contract and the principles that underpin that have got that right.\nQ26 &#xa0; \n \nLord Freeman: We know that dealing with youth unemployment is a matter for member states, essentially, with \nBrussels\n holding the purse \nstrings, or at least holding substantial reserves of money that might be deployed in this field. Do you think there is any initiative that we can take in the \nUnited Kingdom\n to encourage \nBrussels\n to circulate to all member states best and successful practice in this field? For example, in the \nUnited Kingdom\n, to my own practical knowledge, \nwe are \nlooking at success by charities in trying to provide life skills to the 14 to 16\n year-olds\n and then comparing that with whether they become NEETs in due course. I am very attracted to the idea in Germany of employers receiving a state subsidy so long as there is shown \nto be success \nin making sure that the young people employed by companies with state subsidy end up in \nfull-time\n employment. My question is very simple. Do you think that we should be recommending to the UK Government\n, an\nd through the UK Government\n to \nBrussels\n,\n to circulate best practice in all nations?\nThe Chairman: I see two nodding heads. Dr Copeland, you are the odd man out.\nDr Copeland: The circulation of best practices has long been a banner for EU level activity, whether it be in youth policy\n or elsewhere\n, but we think more about the employment strategy, for example, where the more active labour market policies that we have in place at \nUK\n level came from other European countries. I believe \nthat \nactive labour market policies\n,\n or flexicurity as it was termed\n then\n, originate from \nDenmark\n and \nAustria\n and there was that sharing of best practice at E\nU level. My understanding of EU-\nlevel activity and the sharing of best practice is that some platforms for this are already in existence. The Europe 2020 youth on the move initiative, for example, has an annual conference that brings together representatives from the different member states, where different cohorts of the EU’s young will talk about their experiences but different charities and organisations go along and share their experiences and best practices. I believe that in 2011 the \nUK\n declined to send representation to the conference in \nPoland\n at the time.\nLord Freeman: Why?\nDr Copeland: You would have to ask the Government.\nLord Freeman: You must have some inkling.\nDr Copeland: Euroscepticism\n,\n I should imagine. That would be my gut instinct. Since the \nc\noalition Government \nhave \ntaken office, \nthey have \nwithdrawn from some of the softer EU governance processes, whether it be in Europe 2020 and the youth on the move initiative or refusing to set a level of unemployment in the employment strategy of Europe 2020. The reason may be more complex than the one that I suggested\n,\n but there definitely are platforms for the sharing of best practice at EU level\n,\n and our Government ha\nve\n been rather reluctant more recently to engage in those platforms.\nProfessor Maguire: To be fair, I represent\ned\n the \nUK\n at a policy exchange in 2011 in \nWroclaw\n in \nPoland\n. It was a ministerial conference about policy exchange\n,\n and I went and talked at EU level about the implementation of the education maintenance allowance so that other countries could learn from that experience. It may be limited but it has existed. Having said that, it was a bit ironic because the EMA had just been withdrawn in \nEngland\n and I had to stand up and say that, but it was about the policy design and its impact\n,\n and other member states were very interested in using financial incentives. \nT\nhere is a missing link \nin\n that there does not seem to be any follow-up to see how much progress has been made and whether anyone has moved forward. There was lots of talk about different policies, but I have not heard anything from that meeting in 2011 about whether anyone has taken anything further or implemented it.\nDr Copeland: I think there is a separate issue, which is that \nthe Government more recently have\n seemed reluctant to send official representation to these meetings of exchange of best practice, for example.\nProfessor Sloman: Can I add something on this question? One of the queries I \nhave is how the Government feel\n about this European youth guarantee. You have had the witnesses, I have not, but from the information I have had I do not get the impression that they are feeling very positive about it. It seems to me that this is quite a well designed platform for sharing good practice, the structure and the way it is implemented. \nI want to make one other small point on the sharing of best practice that has been a concern of mine for some time, having been a training manager. A lot of the implementation is done at the micro level. The policy and the sharing \nare \nat the macro level and it comes down to the training managers and so on. \nW\ne have initiative fatigue and permanent attempts to try to get training managers of organisations to come along to the conferences, to attend these launches and so on\n. T\nhere is \nalso \nfatigue in the system now when it comes to sharing good practice, and technology is not helping. \nQ27 &#xa0; \nThe Chairman: Do you really think that this fatigue, as you call it, is actually preventing best practice being taken up\n,\n because there is a lot of it around?\nProfessor Sloman: Yes, I think there is. You are absolutely right. We have got to the situation now where employers are trying to avoid being engaged in many of these initiatives because they have seen so many come and go.\nThe Chairman: They have just had too many of them.\nProfessor Sloman: I do not know \nwhether \nyou are familiar with train to gain. There was a sudden knock on the door on train to gain. There was a knock on the door on the pledge, so you would sign the skills pledge and then that disappeared, \nthen there were \nfoundation degrees, and so it goes on and on. I was a training manager and \nI learnt\n a way of coping with that. Our chief executive would be buttonholed by someone who mattered \nwho\n said, “You must sign up to whatever it is”. He would ask the person down the line to come and see me. It would mean some sort of change that we probably would not want to make anyway and probably would not be acceptable by the time it had gone back up\n. If\n I am bluntly honest, the best I could hope for is that it would be forgotten about. It was quite often as crude as that with the training and enterpri\nse councils, the sector skills.\nSince I have depressed you, however, there is some very positive good practice out here. You mentioned the charity sector\n, which is \ndoing some outstanding work in this area, \nas\n indeed are various religious bodies in that broad area, the churches of various sorts, \nbut \nsome of our sector skills councils are \nalso \ntaking the agenda forward very capably. I am very impressed with Cogent, which is the sector skills council for the chemicals industries. \nThey are \ndoing various good things, but \nthey have \nbuilt up that relationship of trust over years with the employers, the trade unions and the employees in \ntheir \nsectors, rather than changing the goalposts and the name and suddenly deciding \nthat \nwe have the great revealed truth, “This is what we need to do”.\nThe Chairman: And have another logo.\nProfessor Sloman: Let us have another logo, another campaign.\nThe Chairman: Before we leave that, Professor Maguire and Dr Copeland, what do you think about this best practice\n? H\now \ncan \nwe unpick it or at least make it move?\nProfessor Maguire: I would reiterate what I have said. There are meetings. Perhaps we do not have the official representation\n,\n but I think \nthat \nwe should have more follow-up and more action following it. It is all right having a conference to share good practice, but what happens after that? We have a lot of intelligence in this country, for example about the NEET population, its definitions and different segments, and we have a lot to share there across \nEurope\n. I think we have a lot to give\n,\n and that should be actively encouraged.\nDr Copeland: We talk about \nthe \nsharing of best practice. We look for short-term immediate results\n,\n but all the research on EU-\nlevel sharing of best practice talks of a much longer-term impact. The sharing of best practice does not manifest itself within say six or 12 months. It can take four, five, sometimes even 10 years. If we think how employment policy has changed across the EU over the last 15 years, it changed in different countries at different times, albeit all moving towards the active labour market policies, but that sharing of best practice took longer than a couple of years. I just err on the side of caution that with the sharing of best practice we are not looking for immediate tangible results. We need to think slightly more long term.\nLord Wilson of Tillyorn: Could we get Professor Sloman to give us a list of these things that have worked? I would be terribly keen to see examples of things that actually have been positive.\nThe Chairman: Yes, that is a good point.\nProfessor Sloman: Yes, of course.\nQ28 &#xa0; \n \nLord Haskel: We have had quite a lot of discussion about the supply side and the demand side. You have raised it. You have told us about job matching. But most of the discussion has in fact been about what the EU and the Government can do. What \ncan \nemployers do? You have told us about the sector skills councils. I think most of them have been abandoned, mainly due to arguments over poaching, on my experience. Employers have a great interest in this because they are saying that they want to bring back the shoe business to \nNorfolk\n, as you were saying, but they do not have any people to make the shoes. Are they going to get robots instead of humans\n to sew the shoes\n?\nProfessor Sloman: Incidentally, just for the record, it was the industrial training boards that were abolished, not the sector skills councils. The sector skills councils are still very much there and some of them are very effective indeed.\nLord Haskel: That is right, yes. \nI mean\n the sector training boards.\nProfessor Sloman: \nI\nncidentally, Lord Haskel, might I say that in the new apprenticeship arrangements White Paper that was published on Monday last week, the sector skills councils were not mentioned at all. It was direct to employers. \nThe answer, of course, is \nthat \nemployers can do an enormous amount. People learn their skills at work. Commu\nnication and team-\nbuilding skills are learnt at work and people learn their skills through having a decent developmental manager who will point out what is going wrong, assist them and spend a bit of time with them. That sort of thing is resource intensive and any particular training scheme is also resource intensive. The problem we have as far as the employer is concerned is tha\nt skills development is a third-\norder decision. The first-\norder decision is what business are you in, so \nthe question is \nhow you compete, how you \ndeliver the service. The second-\norder decision is how you organise the work, how the work \nshould \nbe \norganised. Skills are the third-\norder decision. This is a simplification\n,\n I know\n,\n but I believe it to be fundamentally correct. Once you decide how you are going to compete, it is the work organisation\n,\n and skills come third. It takes an enormous amount of energy and effort to think outside that model and it takes resources. \nLord Wilson talked about my cocktail. The first element in my cocktail would be a change in the Companies Act legislation to ensure that employers meet the social obligation for the development of our workforce in future. That is very controversial, but I do not think we will find a solution within our existing framework while the level of overall demand, and in particular the structural demand as it affects young people, is at the level it is. We will continue to live with a 20% unemployment rate and run the risk of some social disruption. So I think employers need to be fundamentally obliged to do it. That is not popular but that is what I think.\nThe Chairman: I think a lot of good employers have a very highly developed sense of social responsibility and outreach \nin\n the areas \nfrom\n which they operate.\nProfessor Sloman: Yes, they have. \nThat is a\nbsolutely right.\nThe Chairman: Again it could be the sharing of best practice and more publicity being given to people like that. We have run out of time, unfortunately, but Dr Copeland and Professor Maguire, would you like to add anything to what Professor Sloman has just said?\nQ29 &#xa0; \n \nLord Brooke of Alverthorpe: Before we get to that, could I ask one urgent question? Given that we read in the paper that some major employers are already busy recruiting in \nBulgaria\n and \nRomania\n, how do we balance this?\nThe Chairman: Yes, indeed.\nProfessor Maguire: I think we have to come back to the policy obsession that there has been over the last 10 to 15 years about retaining young people in education. We have not really engaged with employers about young people to the degree that we should have, and I think we need to be honest about that and \nto \nstart acknowledging that with employers. I did some research about 10 years ago in \nLeicester\n and employers were saying, “We cannot get our hands on young people because they all stay on at school”. We have to be honest and say, “We need your support now. We have a youth unemployment problem. How can we work with you to sort this out?”\n.\n We have to be honest and say that we have not done that to a satisfactory degree in recent years.\nDr Copeland: What I wanted to say has been covered by Martyn and Sue.\nThe Chairman: Thank you all very much indeed. It has been a riveting session. I know I could have gone on for another couple of hours. There are lots of things\n to ask\n, particularly on this last point, but I am not going to develop it, and \non \nthe point that 50% of all children should go to university and \nthe question of \nwhat skills they get at university. All that is part of it, but it is a diversion. We have a very serious position facing us\n,\n but I am old enough to remember a very serious position in the 1950s\n and \n1960s, and these things do come round. They always said that recessions showed the brightest ones who had the emotion\nal\n intelligence to do something about it rather than think that they were going to be making shoes for the rest of their lives and not realising that things like Crocs and trainers got in the way. Thank you very much indeed. You have given up valuable time\n,\n but I can assure you it has been very valuable to us.\n&#xa0;\n"
