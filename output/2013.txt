[[[National Housing Federation – Written evidence]]]1.1 The National Housing Federation is the voice of affordable housing in England. We believe that everyone should have the home they need at a price they can afford. That’s why we represent the work of housing associations and campaign for better housing. Our members provide two and a half million homes for more than five million people. Each year they invest in a diverse range of neighbourhood projects that help create strong, vibrant communities.&#xa0;1.2 We welcome the opportunity to submit our evidence for the Draft Deregulation Bill. The bill proposes to reduce the eligibility period for the right to buy from five years to three years. We believe that the bill must accompanied by a number of other key changes if the right to buy’s impact on housing associations is to be mitigated. Our key concerns are:

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Government did not effectively consult]]] over substantial increases in right to buy discounts especially in London and did not consider the impact on housing associations or the supply of affordable homes.

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[There is no system in place to monitor]]] the impact of the Preserved Right to Buy upon the supply of affordable homes. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.2.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[There is no effective plan in place to replace affordable homes]]] lost through the Preserved Right to Buy.  &#xa0;1.3 The Joint Committee should recommend legislation be amended to:

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Protect Preserved Right to Buy Receipts (]]]

[[[) ]]]so that local authorities are required to spend their receipts on funding new affordable homes.&#xa0;1.3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Incorporate debt within the cost floor ]]]so the right to buy discount will be reduced if the sales receipt does not cover debt secured against a property. &#xa0;1.4 The Joint Committee should call on Government to:

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.4.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Carry out an independent right to buy review ]]]that takes into account recent evidence and develops more effective ways to build replacement affordable homes.

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.4.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Put in place 

[[[an effective system for regularly monitoring the preserved right to buy ]]]sales and the number of homes being replaced.&#xa0;1.5 Failure to act will result in the right to buy damaging housing association businesses and harming the Government’s ambitions to increase the supply of homes. 2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Right to buy legislation provides local authority tenants and some housing association tenants (approx. 620,000) with the right to buy their home at a discounted price. In April 2012, the discount was increased to £75,000 or 70% for a flat (60% for a house) depending on which is lower. In March 2012, the s discount in London was raised to £100,000. The higher discounts mean the receipt will often not be enough to finance a replacement home and in some cases will not cover the debt secured against the property. &#xa0;2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A housing association tenant will have the PRtB if they were a local authority tenant when their home was transferred into housing association ownership. The PRtB gives tenants the same rights and discounts to buy their homes as local authority tenants. Yet, there are some key differences in how sales receipts are handled:

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[The receipt is shared according to the terms of the transfer agreement.]]] When social housing is transferred from a local authority into a housing association, a transfer agreement is drawn up. Each agreement sets out how any sales receipts will be split. In many cases, the agreement allocates the majority share of the receipt to the local authority with the housing association receiving a smaller share to cover their foregone rental income.

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[PRtB]]]

[[[ sales receipts are unprotected]]]. Once the local authority receives its share, they are under no legal obligation to spend the receipts on funding new homes. Government does not monitor the spending of these sales receipts.&#xa0;2.5 The National Housing Federation  have carried out two surveys of housing associations to understand the impact that higher discounts would have on the sector and the supply of affordable homes. These were the key findings:

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.5.1 

[[[Sales levels]]]: the 2012 Right to Buy Impact Assessment estimated that sales would increase by 150% in three years. Surveyed housing associations believe that sales would far exceed this estimate.

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.5.2 

[[[Transfer agreements]]]: the vast majority of housing associations entered into agreements whereby they retain a small portion of the receipt to cover foregone rental income. The lion’s share goes to the local authority.

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.5.3 

[[[Replacement homes]]]: 92% of respondents declared that they would not be able to replace any homes sold via the PRtB. Only two are able to replace homes, because they retain an unusually large share of the sales receipt.

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.5.4 

[[[Long-term development capacity]]]: 60% of housing associations declared that an increase in discounts would affect their long-term financing arrangements and ultimately build fewer affordable homes. &#xa0;3.1 Since the national discount was raised in April 2012, RTB sales have doubled. Between April 2012 to March 2013, there were nearly 6,000 local authority RTB sales. &#xa0;3.2 PRtB sales also doubled in the past year. According to the Statistical Data Return (published by the Social Housing Regulator), there were 2462 PRtB sales compared to 1106 sales in 2011/12.  As the Government does not monitor the number of PRtB sales on a regular quarterly basis, we do not know the number of PRtB sales in each quarter. However, using financial data within the Social Housing Regulator’s quarterly surveys, we can understand the dramatic increase in PRtB sales receipts on a quarter by quarter basis, as the graph below shows:&#xa0;(The Regulator, Quarterly Survey of Providers, August 2013)3.3 Market intelligence from housing associations also indicates that sales levels are significantly rising across the country. The table below combines data from four different housing associations in Greater Manchester, demonstrating the impact that the increased discounts is having on sales and applications:&#xa0;

[[[Background]]]&#xa0;4.1 Phoenix Housing Association is a medium-sized resident-led housing association. They currently own and manage 5,488 general needs homes and 825 leasehold homes. It has a very strong community focus, which is reinforced by having all its stock concentrated in the south of the London Borough of Lewisham. &#xa0;4.2 Phoenix is a stock transfer housing association. As the transfer agreement was drawn up in 2007, when the right to buy discounts and sales were significantly lower, the agreement allocates the lion’s share of any sales receipt to the local authority. Phoenix is only apportioned the rental income foregone. Furthermore, as they are a recent stock transfer, nearly 4,000 out of around 5,500 tenants still have the PRtB; this includes 1,330 tenants who have the PRtB but are aged over 65 years of age. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.3 Phoenix is also committed to bringing all their existing homes up to the ‘Phoenix Standard’. This standard surpasses the current Decent Homes standard. To achieve this standard, Phoenix is investing its own resources in improving the quality of its housing stock. &#xa0;

[[[Right to Buy Sales]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.4 Phoenix has seen a growing level of applications and right to buy sales. In 2011/12, there were just four right to buy completions. Last year, there were nine completions. More than doubling the level of sales. This year Phoenix expects 33 sales during 2013/14. &#xa0;4.5 The increase in the discount has generated significant interest in the right to buy. Right to buy applications surged last year from less than twentyin 2011/12 to 75 last year. During 2013/14, Phoenix already have seventy one live applications with over half the financial year remaining. &#xa0;

[[[Replacing Homes Sold via the ]]]

[[[PRtB]]]&#xa0;4.6 Property values are significantly lower in the south of LB Lewisham and some of the lowest values in London. All Phoenix’s stock is located in the south of the borough. By way of comparison, their average flat is valued at £120,000 to £145,000. In LB Lewisham, as a whole, flats are valued at around £240,000 and across London flats are worth, on average, £337,239 (Land Registry, April 2013). The table overleaf shows the average valuation levels and the average receipt for Phoenix Housing Association:&#xa0;

[[[                                £27,332]]]&#xa0;4.7 The table above demonstrates that Phoenix does not have the resources to sustainably replace the homes lost via the PRtB. Their share of the receipt will only cover lost rental income. In some cases, it does not cover the debt secured against the property. It also does not provide Phoenix with any funds for re-investing in new homes. Likewise, Lewisham Council, under the terms of the transfer and HRA regulations, must use any receipts to pay off historic debt rather than invest in new homes. Therefore, the changes to right to buy will erode the supply of affordable homes in the south of Lewisham. Below are two examples, of recently completed sales, that demonstrate how the new £100,000 discount is playing out in practice:&#xa0;

[[[£27,332]]]&#xa0;

[[[The impact on long-term capacity]]]&#xa0;4.8 During the course of 2013/14, Phoenix have already sold 12 properties via the PRtB. These properties were worth £1.8m. They were sold for around £950,000. Under its transfer agreement, Phoenix only retained £250,000 (14% of the property’s value) and the Lewisham Council retained the remaining sales receipt.&#xa0;4.9 Phoenix expect to sell 33 properties in the course of 2012/13, of which 15 would be flats and 18 would be houses. Under this scenario, Phoenix could expect to lose around £5.25m in the value of their asset base in a single year of operation. Moreover, Phoenix will only retain around £750,000 in sales receipts. If they continue to lose their assets at this pace, their asset base will be significantly eroded within a few years. Over time, it will make it harder for them to re-finance existing debts and to take on additional borrowing. If that becomes a reality, they will have less capacity  and could stop developing new homes.5.1 With a surge in the number of right to buy sales, housing associations are receiving insufficient sales receipts to replace the homes lost from the sector. As they are not able to build replacement homes, right to buy is eroding their asset base, financial capacity and ability to build new homes. This finding is supported by the Regulator, which stated in the last Quarterly Survey, that housing associations

[[[ ]]]“with high number of transfer properties eligible for preserved RTB may derive some short-term economic benefit, but need to be careful to manage the long-term risk associated with loss of stock.” However, housing associations need more resources to manage these risks. Government intervention is needed now to manage these risks. Otherwise, right to buy discounts will eventually harm the Government ambition to increase the long-term supply of new homes.6.1 The impact of the higher national discounts is becoming clearer. 

[[[The Joint Committee should recommend that legislation be amended to:]]]&#xa0;6.1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Protect Preserved Right to Buy Receipts]]]: there must be a requirement for councils to spend at least a proportion of their PRtB receipts on building new homes. This legislative change would not only help housing associations replace stock lost via the PRtB, it would also help the Government deliver replace more homes lost via the PRtB  

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Incorporate debt within the cost floor]]]: the higher discounts means that the receipt is sometimes insufficient to pay down the debt secured against the property. An amendment to the Cost Floor Rules (Section 131, Housing Act 1985)

[[[ ]]]could allow housing associations to reduce the level of discount if the sales receipt does not cover the debt. This would protect the borrowing arrangements of housing associations. In doing so, it would give them the confidence to continue making long-term investments in improving the quality of their housing stock that are worth millions of pounds. &#xa0;6.2

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Put in place a more effective system for monitoring preserved right to buy sales: ]]]Government needs a better understanding of the increased discounts upon preserved right to buy sales levels.
