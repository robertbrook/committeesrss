"Written evidence from M. Wahlberg (HSR 024) &#xa0;Written evidence submitted by \nMadeleine Wahlberg in a personal capacity.\n I am a member of the Offchurch Action Group against HS2.\n \nI am neither a member of nor a donator to any political party and have no personal financial interest in any company or NGO. I am retired but was a university lecturer and researcher. \nI have taken a special interest in EC TEN-T policy\n and in trans\n-\nEuropean\n \ncitizen \ngroups concerning HSR\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n1 Summary&#xa0;\n2 Background&#xa0;\n2.1 \n The most common response from MPs when asked a\nbout the connection between \nHS2 and TEN-T policy is summed up by The Secretary of State for Transport who \nvehemently \nsaid \n“HS2 has nothing to do with Europe”\n.\n \n As this is patently untrue although oft repe\nated, it seems right to ask\n why there is so littl\ne \nunderstanding of TEN-T policy\n \n(or \nsuch \na widespread refusal to \nopenly \nacknowledge TEN-T policy); \nand whether the TSC has taken the same view or \nis by contrast fully aware of \ncurrent \nTEN-T policy and its likely or possible impacts on the development of the \nHS2 proposal\n?\n&#xa0;\n2.2  Assurance on \nTSC knowledge of TEN-T in relation to the HS2 proposal\n \nwould be particularly \npertinent \nin the light of the\n \n“\nmost radical overhaul of EU infrastructure policy since its inception\n”\n \nwhich has \nbeen agreed by the European Parli\nament\n today\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.3  \nI wish to raise this issue specifically without raising any issues about whether the UK should \nor should not repatriate powers from, or\n leave the EU. \nNor am I\n interested in \nscarem\no\nngering\n about \n‘\nEU control of UK transport policy\n’\n.\n Nor am I taking a view of whether TEN-T policy is \nitself \neither positive or negative. \n&#xa0;\n3  Source of advice for TSC&#xa0;3.1  \nGiven that \nit was the Secretary of State for Transport \nwho\n said \n“\nHS2 has nothing to do with Europe\n”\n,\n \nI do not\n have confidence that the Department for Transport would be sufficiently informed about the latest TEN-T policy to provide TSC with \nan adequate\n view of the issues in relation to \nthe \nHS2\n proposal\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.2  As I have raised the issue of TEN-T policy on numerous\n occasions with HS2\n Ltd\n staff, and have had ill-informed responses, I do not have the confidence th\nat HS2 Ltd has any inkling of\n the latest TEN-T policy\n nor its potential impacts on HS2\n.\n3.3  At the recent European Commission meeting on TEN-T policy that I\n attended in Tallinn, \nEC staff who are central to the implementation of TEN-T had almost no understanding of the \nstrategic \ncase either for or against the HS2\n proposal. I do not have confidence that they could adequately inform the TSC on the impacts of the\n latest TEN-T policy on HS2. \n&#xa0;\n3.4   \nIt is my view that \nt\nhe TSC should acquire an independent and informed view of the impact of the \nlatest \nTEN-T policy \non \nthe HS2 proposal.\n&#xa0;\n4  Possible issues of concern&#xa0;\nFour areas are suggested here \nas \ninitial \nexemplars \nof issues that the TSC might wish to review\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.1  \nThe reduction in priority for the ‘East Y’ arm of HS2\n. The latest TEN-T maps no longer show the East Y with ‘Core’ status.\n It is now not part of Core Corridor 8 (Cork to Marseilles). \nThe line f\nrom Birmingham to \nLeeds is now only shown with\n lower ‘Comprehensive’ status. A possible reason for this \n‘\ndowngrading\n’\n or removal of Core status\n is that it reflects a lowering of the priority to build the extension \nof HS2 \nto Leeds. There is a commitment und\ner TEN-T regulations that Core routes will be completed by 2030 but Comprehensive routes will only need to be implemented by 2050. Is the current status o\nf the East Y a reflection of a\n changed strategic case for HS2? Will this be reflected in a changed ana\nlysis \nregarding\n the \ninclusion\n of WEIs\n from the North East? \n \nIs this \nlower priority status for the East Y \nintended to reflect the way in which HS2 will be delivered cheaper and faster? \n&#xa0;\n4.2 \n \nIn earlier \nphases of TEN-T policy\n,\n the scheme that was identified\n to\n improve transport from\n London northwards was the West Coast Main Line. This was then known as Priority Project (PP) 14. EC funds were allocated to the modernisation of WCML\n \nand the \nEC \nsinged it off as a \n“\ncompleted\n”\n project.\n HS2 is e\nssentially taking \nthe TEN-T programme\n back to the starting blocks\n by introducing a second proposal on a similar route to the already completed scheme\n. \nAre there any implications \nof this \nfor the strategic cas\ne for\n \nHS2\n?\n \nWill this impact on the ability of HS2 to access EU CEF\n \nfunding for a\n duplicate (HS2) proposal? \n&#xa0;\n4.3  \nThe HS2 proposal under TEN-T will have to satisfy the EC that it is conforming to a number of ‘design criteria’ such as environmental sustainability, contribution to the carbon reduction targets, limitation o\nn environmental damage\n, multi-modality\n and the involvement \nof civic voice ‘from start to finish’.\n Does the TSC feel that HS2 wi\nll be able to match up to such \nstrategic \ncriteria? What will be the implications for the strate\ngic case of\n HS2 (including the ch\noice of specific route)\n,\n if HS2 as currently configured is not able to satisfy such criteria? \n&#xa0;\n4.4 \nAs part of the latest policy phase, TEN-T has agreed to a n\new governance instrument\n for each\n Corridor\n “\nled\n” by a co\nordinator appointed by the EC. This goes \nbeyond the existing Forums that have existed for some time in order to achieve inter-operability. The intention is that this will ensure that each Corridor is planned, developed and managed \nas a whole, \nand \non the basis of \n“\nEuropean Added V\nalue\n”\n not nationa\nl added value. \nHow will such a new governance instrument impact on the strategic case for HS2? W\nill it \nimpact on the ability \nto make \nstr\nategic decisions \nwith regard to HS2 eg \nwith regard to ticket pricing, staffing, timetabl\ning, contracting for services;\n or at a more policy level\n, will\n it allow or prevent \npolicies on eg a public service ethos; \nre-nationalised rail; the reintegration of services and infrastructure\n?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nConclusion&#xa0;\nTh\nis submission has argued that\n the latest revision of TEN-T policy should be\n acknowledged and understood. \nIt is that policy that will provide the European context for HS2 as a European project. \nWe need a more mature response than the \nfrequently \nheated denial that there is any link between HS2 and TEN-T. \nWe need to understand what the UK is committed to under the 2013 TEN-T policy and whether the HS2 proposal conforms to that. \nI hope that the TSC can take these issues forward.\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n \nPublic interview Kenilworth 3\nrd\n June 2013\n \nhttp://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/infrastructure/news/ep-backs-new-eu-infrastructure-policy_en.htm\n The House of Commons Library Stand\nard \nNote SN184 summarises some of the key potential issues, particularly in the discussion regarding the F\nourth railway Package, but it has\n not\n been\n updated by \nall \nthe 2013 decisions\n. \n \nA broad map of the UK \nTEN-T scheme \nis here \nhttp://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/infrastructure/doc/ten-t-country-fiches/uk.pdf\n  and all 9 corridors can be seen in the \npdf\n at the bottom of this\n \nhttp://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/kallas/headlines/news/2013/10/ten-t-corridors_en.htm\nA more detailed map of Core Corridor 8 is \nattached\n.\n \nhttp://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2010-01-12d.309628.h&amp;s=%28WCML%29+1935-10-01..2013-11-14+section%3Awrans#g309628.r0\n \nhttp://tentea.ec.europa.eu/en/ten-t_projects/30_priority_projects/priority_project_14/\n Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) funds\n \nhttp://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/infrastructure/ten-t- policy/review/doc/com _sec(2011)0101_en.pdf\n   (p9) “\npublic interest should lead to a continuous communication that imp\nlies a true involvement and would avoid the problems described.”\n It seems clear from discussions on the various media that many commentators assume that the UK will be in full control over all of these decisions in relation to HS2. That is less self-evident since the latest agreement in the European Parliament. \n"
