"&#xa0;\nAFS0049Written evidence submitted by Kent County Council&#xa0;\nQuestion 1The effectiveness of academisation in narrowing the gap for disadvantaged children, and what further steps should be taken within the academies system to bring about a transformational impact on student outcomes&#xa0;\n1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKent has 449 primary schools, of which 55 are academies (40 are new sponsored academies and 15 are stand-alone converter ac\nademies, not part of a chain)\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are currently 67 secondary academies (including 3 Free Schools), equivalent two thirds of secondary schools in Kent. 15 of these are traditional sponsored academies (sustained under-performance in areas of disadvantage).  Five are new sponsored acade\nmies (following an Ofsted judgement putting them in Category).  The remaining 47 are converter academies, whose performance was judged by Ofsted to be good or outstanding at the time of conversion.   \n&#xa0;\n1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIrrespective of whether academies were sponsored or co\nnverter, Kent has not seen a narrowing of the achievement gap for FSM children, compared to maintained schools, either at primary or secondary level. The FSM gap for academies is equal to maintained primary schools.\n&#xa0;\n1.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAcademies and Free Schools, through Ken\nt School Collaborative Partnerships are encouraged to work with neighbouring schools and \nlocal authority (\nLA\n) \ncolleagues to get the most out of the pupil premium to narrow the achievement gap.  \n&#xa0;\n1.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWith the support of the LA, Kent schools and their Collabora\ntive Partnerships (of which there are 60 involving 500 schools) are now intensively focusing on narrowing the gap for vulnerable groups.  The LA expects academies to focus on (in the same way as LA maintained school colleagues), ensuring that vulnerable gr\noups are identified, strategies personalised and \np\nupil \np\nremium monies effectively targeted to appropriate strategies.  \n&#xa0;\n1.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nK\nent \nC\nounty \nC\nouncil\n’s\n (KCC)\n autumn term round of Headteacher Briefings (to which all category of schools are invited) by the Corporate \nDirector for Education, Learning and Skills focused on closing the achievement gap – what the performance data is telling us, what strategies are effective (best practice locally and nationally shared) and which schools are using the pupil premium funding \neffectively to narrow the achievement gaps.  \n&#xa0;\n1.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKCC’s weekly E-Bulletin for all schools on 28 November 2013, focused on closing the gap and provided information on effective strategies. KCC is developing a range of good practice case studies in partnership \nwith a number of the schools that are having the biggest impact on this key issue, and with the help of some schools we are also developing a staff development programme to support the adoption of the most effective practices. We will launch this work in F\nebruary 2014. \n&#xa0;\n1.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere seems to be limited evidence that academies per se are having a\n \ngreater impact on narrowing gaps and improving outcomes for disadvantaged pupils. Individual schools make more or less of a difference depending on the quality \nof\n teaching and other intervention strategies to improve outcomes. \nResearch from Machin and Silva (\nSchool Structure, School Autonomy and the Tail, Centre for Economic Performance Special Paper No. 29, LSE, 2013\n), suggest that academies had not yet helped low\n attaining pupils.  \nThis paper shows that improved attainment centres on higher attainers. It also cites research \n(Wilson, J (2011) Are England’s Academies more Inclusive or More ‘Exclusive’? The Impact of Institutional Change on the Pupil Profile of Schoo\nls. CEE Discussion Paper 125)\n which shows a 12.5% reduction in pupils on free school meals, attending (traditional sponsored) academies compared with the schools they replaced. \n&#xa0;\n1.9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMore widely in terms of overall pupil achievement, recent research has found that there is no direct correlation between being an academy and improved attainment levels, reflected in Ofsted judgements.  The critical characteristic to raising attainment in \na school is the individual capacity of the school leadership. Many sponsored academies are improving the quality of education and pupil outcomes, as they have often replaced very poorly performing schools.  \n&#xa0;\n1.10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is interesting to note that research commiss\nioned by the L\nocal \nG\novernment \nA\nssociation (LGA)\n into GCSE results at both academies and maintained schools, published by the NFER in November 2013, \n(\nAnalysis of academy school performance in the 2011 and 2012 GCSEs\n),\n states that academies do not necessaril\ny outperform non-academies at GCSE. The study found that in analysing school-level GCSE data since 2007, there is no significant improvement in the rate of improvement of GCSE results for academies over and above the rate of improvement in all schools. It \nsuggested characteristics of a school, such as strong leadership or the quality of teaching, are more likely to be responsible for differences seen, rather than the school's organisational structure.\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 2The process for approving, compelling and establishing academies and free schools, including working with sponsors&#xa0;2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKent LA has developed a good working relationship with the DfE in managing the conversion of schools that wish to become academies and in making arrangements for some schools \nto be sponsored as academies as a result of poor performance or an inadequate inspection judgement. The LA is now helpfully at a point where \nwe are\n identifying local sponsors for Kent schools that require an academy solution. At the same time the LA has a \ngood working relationship with some, but not all, academy chains that sponsor academies in Kent. It is disappointing that some chains do not respond to our invitation to work more closely together or to offers to help academy chain schools that are still s\ntruggling to improve. \n&#xa0;\n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn terms of what’s not always working well, we would cite the following issues. The proposed sponsor sometimes makes considerable extra demands upon \nthe LA and its financial and capital resources towards the end of the process \nof\n tr\nansfer of a school to an academy chain. \nThis slows down, and can hinder\n the conversion process and can interfere with the urgent school improvement work required.  \nThe issuing of an Academy Order can therefore be significantly delayed. In one instance the \nsponsor pulled out at the very end of the process, leaving the school and the local authority without a solution. Sponsors need to be better at due diligence and be committed from the outset.  Considerable public resource and LA Officer time is expended un\nnecessarily waiting for sponsors to decide to proceed with their initial interest. The LA is concerned about the lack of engagement at the earliest opportunity regarding new Free School proposals.  As the strategic commissioner of new school provision, the\n LA would welcome early involvement in free school proposals to create new pupil provision in areas of evidenced need.\n&#xa0;\n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt present we have five Free Schools open in Kent.  All are in areas of socio-economic advantage, rather than growing diversity and \nchoice in disadvantaged areas of need.  There appears to be ‘middle class capture’ of the Free Schools process, in order to create new capacity in areas that do not necessarily need school places.\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 3The role of the Secretary of State in intervening in and supporting failing academies, and how this role will work as the programme expands&#xa0;3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is concern about the oversight by the DfE of under-performing and failing academies. The issuing of a warning notice is a limited form of interventio\nn and support. In Kent, failing academies do not appear to be being turned around as fast as they should be when they are continuing to perform poorly.  For example, in 2005 a failing secondary high school, in area of socio-economic disadvantage was conver\nted to a traditional sponsored academy.  Since that time, it has been the subject of an Ofsted Category twice and to date, the principal sponsor remains and the Academy Trust do not appear to have been transparently held to account by the Secretary of Stat\ne.  No Warning Notice has been served on this Academy Trust to date.\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 4The functions and responsibilities in relation to academies and free schools of local authorities and other organisations operating between the Secretary of State and individual schools; what these functions and responsibilities should be; and what gaps there are in support for schools at this level&#xa0;4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKent County Council plays a strong role in school improvement, continues to relate and work with all schools irrespective of their status and monitors the outcomes for children and young people being educated in the county. Where academy schools are under-\nperforming and need to improve at a faster rate we offer support. A good number of academies buy back the services of the local authority. We continue to relate to all schools in carrying out our responsibilities for admissions, SEN, exclusions and the com\nmissioning of new school places. We recognise the need for the LA as a strong ‘Middle Tier’ between all schools and the Secretary of State.  We would like more opportunity to hold under-performing academies to account for the outcomes they are achieving fo\nr Kent children and families. \n&#xa0;\n4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt present KCC is unclear how the LA can be held to account for the performance of academies beyond outlining our concerns to the trusts and governing bodies concerned, and to the Secretary of State. This is unsatisfactory. \n&#xa0;\n4.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKCC has no powers or funding to tackle underperformance in academies, nonetheless as an LA, we have been inviting academies and free schools to work with the family of Kent schools through the 60 School Collaborative Partnerships established since 2012 t\no create a sustainable, self-improving school system. This is working well and many academy schools are supporting other schools to improve. \n&#xa0;\n4.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAround two thirds of all academies nationally now are converter academies (\ni.e.\n good or outstanding schools). KCC\n expects these high performing academies to commit to supporting under-performing neighbouring schools, and while most schools respond well, KCC would welcome support to persuade government to make this requirement a more robust obligatory component in the\n funding agreement when schools convert to academies. \n&#xa0;\n4.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn order to support academies and monitor their outcomes, Kent School Improvement Service offers all academies two consultation visits per year. Most schools take up this offer with some paying for ad\nditional commissioned school improvement support.  \n&#xa0;\n4.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhere an academy is experiencing difficulties and improvement is not evident, the LA writes to the Principal and the Academy Trust outlining our concerns and support we are able to provide.  If there is no positive response, KCC alerts Ofsted and the Secre\ntary of State. \n&#xa0;\n4.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKent County Council has continued to play a strong role in education as the middle tier. There is a strong shared vision with schools and close partnership with schools. We see this as essential for improving educational outcomes and the q\nuality of schools, as well as for the integration of children’s services. We see the potential atomisation and fragmentation of the education system as a serious risk to delivering joined up early intervention and prevention services for vulnerable childre\nn and young people, and to making the best local strategic arrangements for pupils with special educational needs and those excluded from school. \n&#xa0;\n4.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBold Steps for Education Vision and Priorities for Improvement 2014-17\n sets out how  KCC will work in partne\nrship with  schools to create the conditions in which pupils experience the best learning and teaching, and where  their’ moral and intellectual development and confidence can flourish.  Bold Steps is a coherent strategy to effectively fulfil KCC’s respons\nibilities, acting as the strategic advocate of a joint shared vision for education, learning and skills in Kent. As the legitimate democratic champion for children, parents and the communities of Kent this vision sets out how KCC will as the middle tier\n,\n p\nromote excellence across the system by ensuring:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTension between accountability and autonomy&#xa0;\n4.9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n‘\nSchool autonomy is a good thing if it is within a system that allows cooperation and support for weak schools.  School autonomy \nalso needs to exist within a system of strong, external accountability.  If autonomy leads to a free for all, then the school system \nfragment, the difference in outcomes between schools grows\n and standards fall overall.’\n              (Andreas Schleicher, Head of \nEducation Analysis for the OECD, in a report published on 13 September 2011, ‘Education at a Glance’)\n4.10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOne of the big\ngest challenges\n in \nthe current\n school system is that \nLAs\n are\n legally\n responsible for the education\n performance\n of all children, but have pow\ner\ns\n to intervene locally in \nmaintained schools only. There is no organisational regional structure to relate to about \nfailing academies and free schools\n, apart from the D\nf\nE\n,\n and individual trusts that may themselves be lacking capacity to support the neces\nsary improvements. The DfE does not respond constructively when the LA expresses concern about the performance of some academies. \n4.11.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKCC supports the \nL\nGA in its call for LAs to be empowered to intervene early in struggling schools regardless of whether they \nare academies or local authority-maintained schools:\n \n              \n\"Councils are restlessly ambitious for all children in their local area whatever type of school they attend but have to jump through many hoops before they are allowed to intervene where there are sign\ns of failure. As Ofsted increases its inspection of councils' role in improving education, councils need a free hand to intervene early in struggling schools and to reassure mums and dads that their child's one chance at education will give them the best s\ntart in life.\"\n              \n(Cllr. David Simmonds, Chairman of LGA's Children and Young People Board, 13 November 2013)\n&#xa0;\n4.12.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBut to do this LAs need to remain sustainable in their capacity to support school improvement.  Shifts in education policy, power, accountability \nand funding are increasing\nly\n making it more difficult to maintain the capacity of some Councils to fulfil the statutory duty of ensuring the best possible education for all children in an area, irrespective of the type of school they attend.\n&#xa0;\n4.13.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKCC believes \nit is not timely to be designing unnecessary new regional bureaucracies to ensure proper oversight of the academy school system, about which there is little detail so far to provide the future proofing that is needed to secure high standards and continuous\n \nimprovement in\n all academies and free schools. \n&#xa0;\nQuestion 5What role academy chains play or should play in the new school landscape; how accountable they are; and what issues they raise with regard to governance arrangements&#xa0;5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAcademy chains are a \nsignificant player but they are a small part of the education landscape and there are questions about their capacity and track record in bringing about the necessary improvements in poorly performing academies. Some are very successful, some not. It appear\ns that some academy chains have been allowed to grow without sufficient regard to the quality of the provision they offer.\n&#xa0;\n5.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn terms of accountability, chains are accountable to their Trust and then the Secretary of State.  There is no local democratic acc\nountability, and this lack of transparency and accountability should be addressed.\n There is a need for a proper strategic relationship between the LA as commissioner and the major academy providers (whether national chains or more local groupings\n). This is\n something the LA seeks to achieve on the ground, but the current policy framework is not especially supportive of it.\n&#xa0;\n5.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe recent announcement by Lord Nash, stating that academy chains will be inspected by Ofsted in the future is welcome, as long as judgements are made about their local impact and their level of accountability to the community they serve.   \n&#xa0;Question 6The appropriateness of academy status for primary schools and what special factors apply and what evidence there is that academy status can bring value for money either for individual primary schools or for the system as a whole&#xa0;6.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKent is experiencing slow progress in respect of primary academy conversions. Few primary schools are attracted to academy status. In November 2013, there were 55 Kent primary \na\ncademies out of 449 primary schools (12%).  Of the 55 primary \na\ncademies, 15 are\n stand-alone conversions but the other 40 are sponsored \na\ncademies, consequent upon low performance and inadequate Ofsted Inspection judgements.  \n&#xa0;\n6.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are a further 20 schools with an Academy Order pending, with conversion likely to take place between De\ncember 2013 and May 2014. Some of these are church schools and will join diocesan multi-academy trusts, and some are under-performing schools. \n&#xa0;\n6.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEast Kent has the highest number of primary \na\ncademies with 23 schools, compared to West Kent which has 8 primar\ny \na\ncademies. \n&#xa0;\n6.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe rush to convert to academy status may be over as the financial gains have diminished. Schools are pragmatic. A survey in 2012 conducted by the Schools Network found that 78% had converted in part because they believed they would be bette\nr off financially.  \n&#xa0;\n6.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSchools are primarily focused on what can help them raise attainment. Some may judge that acquiring academy status supports this endeavour. Others schools may procure valuable services from the LA and use the LA’s collaborative struct\nures to secure support for teaching and learning and school improvement. In Kent, local soft and hard federations of schools have often been preferred by school governing bodies as \na more effective\n route to school improvement, rather than through securing \nacademy status.  The Kent family of schools offers local flexibility, knowledge and expertise about what works, compared to a distant academy chain or central government support and control.\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 7What alternatives to sponsored academy status should be offered to failing primary schools &#xa0;7.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn some cases, where radical improvement and re-organisation are needed to respond to a history of failure and under-performance an academy sponsor solution\n is appropriate, where it will bring significant additional capacity for improvement. KCC supports these solutions and values the opportunity to work with sponsors to bring these structural solutions to fruition, and have an on-going working relationship. \n&#xa0;\n7.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn other cases however, we have been able to broker a quicker solution for improvement by developing a hard federation with an outstanding local school or by brokering a soft federation, established through the Kent School Collaborative Partnerships who kn\now each other’s capabilities and trust each other. In these cases we seek stronger and sometimes new school leadership and more effective governance, which often achieves a very quick turnaround and \na \nsustainable upward trend in a school’s performance.  \n&#xa0;\n7.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKCC prefers a more mixed approach with some flexibility. Often it seems the D\nf\nE is only inte\nrested in one kind of solution.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n7\n&#xa0;\n"
