"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Mark Ryan\n&#xa0;\n1. My name is Mark Ryan and I am a Senior Lecturer in Constitutional and Administrative Law at \nCoventry\n \nUniversity\n. My submission, however, is made in my personal capacity and indicates my \nbrief \npersonal observations in respect of the \nFixed-term Parliaments Act 2011\n. It in no way reflects the views of my employer (Coventry University). \n&#xa0;\n2. \nAt the outset the point must be made that the enactment of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 is to be welcomed as \nproviding a degree of certainty to\n the date of \nparliamentary elections and in doing so reducing \nexecutive power in the United Kingdom’s uncodified constitutional arrangements.\n In addition, \nthe Act \nwill allow for a more structured approach to the legislative process. \n  \n&#xa0;\n3. In order to ensure that the final year of the Parliament includes a substantive and viable legislative programme, \ntwo points could be made. Firstly, \nGovernment \nBills scheduled to form part of the 2014-15 session should be \nissued \nin \ndraft \nin early 2014 in order that the \nprincipal \nelements of the\nse \nmeasure\ns\n c\nan b\ne examined \nan\nd\n scrutinised well in advance of \nthe\nm being introduced as \nfully fledged Bill\ns\n. \n \nAs an aside, \nthe \npublication o\nf \nBills in draft \nshould be standard \nlegislative practice\n in any event\n.\n \n \nSecondly\n (and as a caveat to the above), \nt\nhe content of any \nB\nill \nscheduled \nfor the 2014-15 session\n \nshould not be too party politically controversial or indeed contain any major constitutional reform \nproposals\n.\n&#xa0;\n4. \nOne key \nadvantage of the Fixed-term Parliaments \nA\nct is\n,\n of course\n,\n that it should dispense with the \n‘\nwash up\n’\n and allow\n \nfor \nlegislation to be carefully \nscheduled \n (at least in the House of Commons) \nand \nso enable appropriate \nand adequate \nscrutiny to take place\n \nof \neach element of \nevery \nBill\n.\n \n \nIn terms of select committees, they will \nalso \nbe \nable to plan and \nco-ordinate \nthe \ngathering and marshalling of \nwritten and oral \nevidence in \nthe light of \na more organised and \npredictable \nlegislative programme.\n&#xa0;\n5. It is arguable that if there had not been a Conservative–Liberal Democrat Coalition Government, then the detail of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act might have been different. \n \nIn particular, it could be \nposited \nthat the key provision of section \n1\n may well have been a term of four years as opposed to five in the \nAct\n. \nA four year term would arguably \nhave fitted in more with the existing structure of \nour \nconstitutional arrangements\n (viz., devolution\n/\n local government\n and the practical reality of \nthe length of \nrecent parliamentary terms\n).\n      \n \n     \n&#xa0;\n6. Finally, it is earne\nstly \nhoped that the report \nthat t\nh\nis \nselect committee \nwill publish in due course \non th\ne Fixed-term Parliaments Act \nwill \nbe \nconsidered carefully \nby the \ncommittee \nto be set up in 2020 \nwhich will u\nndertake a review of the operation of the Act (having been set up \nby the Prime Minister\n \nin 2020 \nin accordance with \nsection 7\n)\n.\n&#xa0;\n12\n \nJanuary  \n201\n4\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
