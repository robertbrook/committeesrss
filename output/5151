[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.    
[normal]I am writing to you in order to contribute to the evidence which you are considering in the course of your inquiry into tobacco smuggling and the trade in illicit tobacco. In this letter we 
[normal]seek
[normal] to explain
[normal] how the 
[normal]UK
[normal] 
[normal]could make progress in combating the illicit trade in tobacco products and increase tax revenues
[normal] 
[normal]through
[normal] the application of the latest secure tracking and tracing technology. 
[normal] We stand ready to p
[normal]rovide additional information as
[normal] required.

[normal]2.    
[normal]SICPA is
[normal] the
[normal] leading
[normal] internationa
[normal]l provider of security inks to c
[normal]entral banks and high security printers for the production of bank notes
[normal]. SICPA is also a
[normal] 
[normal]major [bold]independent supplier [bold]to governments [bold]of [bold]secure [bold]track and trace systems[bold] [bold]which can be used for supply chain control
[normal] [bold]supporting the collection of excise [bold]and other [bold]tax[bold]es[bold]. 
[normal]The compan
[normal]y’
[normal]s 
[normal]S
[normal]ICPATRACE
[normal]® 
[normal]platform is the basis for a number of successful national systems
[normal] 
[normal]which have significantly raised tax revenues and reduced levels of fraud. Systems 
[normal]covering a range of products 
[normal]have been 
[normal]implemented in a diverse rang
[normal]e of countries across the globe 
[normal]including e.g. 
[normal]Turkey
[normal] (since 2007
[normal]),
[normal] 
[normal]Brazil
[normal] (since 200
[normal]8)
[normal], the states of 
[normal]California
[normal] and 
[normal]Massachusetts
[normal]. 
[normal]Currently 
[normal]almost 8
[normal]0bn 
[normal]units of product
[normal] are being marked 
[normal]and controlled 
[normal]by our systems annually. 
[normal]In consequence
[normal] the company has extensive firsthand experience 
[normal]of the daily problems faced by g
[normal]overnments and enforcement agencies 
[normal]in their efforts to combat the 
[normal]illici
[normal]t trade in tobacco products and
[normal] to 
[normal]maximise t
[normal]ax revenue
[normal] collected
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.    
[normal]Since its inception and initial deployment the S
[normal]ICPATRACE
[normal]®
[normal] platform has been continually developed in order to broaden the range of solutions available
[normal] 
[normal]to our government clients. Attention has also been given to ensuring
[normal] minimal 
[normal]interference with the activities of
[normal] manufacturers and other stakeholders
[normal] and 
[normal]to 
[normal]assure a level
[normal] playing field for large and small manufacturers alike
[normal]. The latest innovations and developments take full account of the requirements of the W
[normal]orld

[normal] the introduction of a global tracking and tracing regime as a means of combating the illicit trade.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The [bold]UK[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.    
[normal]No single system is likely to be able to completely
[normal] eliminate the illicit trade in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] given
[normal] its
[normal] different component parts, but 
[normal]SICPA believes that implementation of a
[normal] 
[normal]Government controlled[bold] i[bold]ndependent[bold] [bold]system [bold]exploiting [bold]secure [bold]authentication and[bold] tracing and tracking functionality[bold] 
[normal]w
[normal]ould have significant
[normal] positive impact and should be part of a comprehensive approach.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In summary t
[normal]his positive impact would result from:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What is a secure track and trace system?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]5.    
[normal]A secure track and trace system 
[normal]begins by securely marking a unit of product (e.g. a pack of cigarettes) and
[normal] assigning 
[normal]to 
[normal]it a unique identity which is stored in a government owned and controlled database
[normal].
[normal] This can be done in such a way as to provide a 
[normal]fully reliable 
[normal]test of authenticity and to be information rich (linked to data about e.g. product 
[normal]type
[normal], time and place of manufacture, intended market of sale
[normal] et al
[normal]). The unique identity 
[normal]and the database are 
[normal]the building block
[normal]s
[normal] of a tracking capability which allows the unit to be followed throughout the supply chain -
[normal] if required 
[normal]up 
[normal]to 
[normal]the point of sale to the consumer. 
[normal] 
[normal]They also provide
[normal] the means to tra
[normal]ce backwards 
[normal]in real-time 
[normal]to point of origin
[normal]/manufacture
[normal] 
[normal]etc
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]at anytime during the product lifecycle.
[normal] 
[normal]A properly secure system is essential to meet the challenge of ever more sophisticated organised crime groups.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The key components[bold]&#xa0;[bold]6.    
[normal]The 
[normal]quality of the marking system is key[bold]. 
[normal]Marks that are properly secure and well-designed
[normal] to meet the needs of the different stakeholders
[normal], such as those recommended by SICPA, 
[normal]are easy to use, 
[normal]make counterfeiting virtually impossible
[normal] and provide information that enables enforcement
[normal]. 
[normal]We assess that the current 
[normal]UK
[normal] protection system (which 
[normal]we understand 
[normal]combines a
[normal]n easy-to-copy black ink 
[normal]‘
[normal]UK
[normal] tax paid’ mark combined with a material
[normal]-based
[normal] feature on the tear tape) to be 
[normal]relatively 
[normal]weak. 
[normal]Moreover 
[normal]illicit cigarettes in 
[normal]h
[normal]igh quality counterf
[normal]eited packaging are
[normal] difficult 
[normal]for enforcers 
[normal]to identify in real-time and need to be verified by manufacturers
[normal],
[normal] which 
[normal]can cause
[normal] inconvenience and delay
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.    
[normal]SICPA 
[normal]recommends 
[normal]a 
[normal]multi-layered approach combining material-based [bold]security [bold]features[bold] (security inks which are both visible and invisible)
[normal],
[normal] [bold]IT security[bold] features[bold] (2D secure matrix, visible and/or invisible)
[normal] and 
[normal]forensic features[bold].  
[normal]Secure o
[normal]vert features can be seen by consumers thus encouraging good citizenship; additional semi-covert features can be made available to e.g. retailers so they can protect themselves from unscrupulous suppliers; covert features can be verified by enforcers using bespoke checking equipment and used as evidence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.    
[normal]Both domestically produced 
[normal](including for export if required) 
[normal]and imported product can be marked
[normal],
[normal] but by definition it is only possible to mark product which is produced in a
[normal] declared/leg
[normal]itimate manufacturing facility
[normal] and/or
[normal] legitimately imported
[normal]. This does not mean (as some manuf
[normal]acturers might claim) that the
[normal] 
[normal]implementation of such a system ha
[normal]s 
[normal]no impact on the black and grey
[normal] markets
[normal] (where product moves between illegitimate and legitimate channels)
[normal]. Illegal product (i.e. produced illegally such as ‘illicit whites’ or illegal by 
[normal]virtue of being non-tax paid) would be
[normal] immediately identifiable
[normal] to all stakeholders
[normal] by the absence of the appropriate secure mark. 
[normal]Checks by enforcers 
[normal](linked back in real-time to the national database
[normal] and able to share with and interact with other government databases
[normal]) 
[normal]produce data not only to answer the question ‘
[normal]is this genuine or not
[normal]?
[normal]’ but 
[normal]to 
[normal]other 
[normal]enquiries such as
[normal] ‘
[normal]I
[normal]s this supposed to be coming here
[normal]?’
[normal] 
[normal]and
[normal] 
[normal]‘W
[normal]hat
[normal] tax
[normal] has 
[normal]been paid
[normal]?
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Business intelligence[bold]&#xa0;[bold]9.    
[normal]Techniques for e
[normal]xploit
[normal]ing data are progressing every day
[normal] and
[normal],
[normal] as more data is collected over-time
[normal],
[normal] become ever more powerful
[normal]. Data analysis and automated comparison of different data sets can identify patterns and anomalies which allow enforcers to make interventions against targets that would otherwise not have been spotted
[normal] and to identify changes in criminal behaviours. It also allows performance management of enforcer interventions (e.g. by locality or type) 
[normal]clarifying 
[normal]which 
[normal]interventions 
[normal]worked best.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]International agreements[bold]&#xa0;[bold]10.    
[normal]The 
[normal]UK
[normal] was an adopting party to the Protocol of the WHO 
[normal]FCTC
[normal] to 
[normal]‘
[normal]Eliminate the Illicit Trade in Tobacco 
[normal]P
[normal]roducts
[normal]’
[normal] in 
[normal]Seoul
[normal] in November 2012. 
[normal]As on so many topics where the 
[normal]UK
[normal] has taken the lead, what the 
[normal]UK
[normal] does in relation to the Protocol will be watched by other countries and followed by them.
[normal] Much of the 
[normal]UK
[normal]’s problem has its origin overseas
[normal] (‘upstream’)
[normal] and proper implementation in these countries would positively impact on the 
[normal]UK
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11.    
[normal]The Protocol recognises the crucial 
[normal]global 
[normal]dimension of the illicit trade in tobacco products
[normal] and the need to ensure international co-operation and joint working
[normal]. Among the measures agreed is
[normal],
[normal] in
[normal] A
[normal]rticle 8 of the Protocol
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the requirement to implement national track and trace systems which are globally inter-operable[bold]. The Protocol foresees a five year period after coming into force for compliant national systems to be in place. 
[normal]In order to maximise value for money and longevity it 
[normal]is import
[normal]ant that any system foreseen in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] take
[normal]s
[normal] full account of the 
[normal]provisions
[normal] of the Protocol
[normal], which includes the requirement that any system be 
[normal]fully controlled by government and independent of the tobacco manufacturers[bold].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12.    
[normal]Having followed the process of negotiation with care and adapted our R
[normal]esearch
[normal] and D
[normal]evelopment
[normal] programme to take account of it, we are conscious that i
[normal]mplementing the spirit as well as the letter of the Protocol in an efficient way will not be a straight forward exercise e.g. it requires accurate aggregation (linking 
[normal]a 
[normal]single unit to higher level packaging i
[normal].
[normal]e
[normal].
[normal] a pack of cigarettes to 
[normal]its carton
[normal], and a carton
[normal] to its mastercase et al
[normal]) which requires high-level technical and engineering expertise as well as advanced IT
[normal]. In this area, as in others, SICPA is a patent holder.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Common approaches[bold] between Ireland and UK[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]13.    
[normal]The Committee has specifically noted its interest in the interrelationship between 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] and the 
[normal]UK
[normal]. 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] currently has a
[normal] tax stamp 
[normal]containing security features 
[normal]but no track and trace functionality. We believe 
[normal]that in the absence of a decision in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] to follow suit, 
[normal]the implementation of standardised packaging in 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] is likely to have little short term impact
[normal] 
[normal]in the 
[normal]UK
[normal].
[normal] Irish tax pa
[normal]id product (in contras
[normal]t to tax paid product in some other EU countries) is at least as expensive as 
[normal]UK
[normal] tax paid product and not attractive to illicit traders. It is possible that implementation of standardised packages may encourage a ris
[normal]e in counterfeit product which imitates the standardised packs but this is likely to be essentially an Irish problem. These packs could be traded in 
[normal]North
[normal]ern
[normal] Ireland
[normal] and other parts of the 
[normal]UK
[normal], but they would be clearly identifiable as non-UK tax paid. In the longer term and in view of proximity, current smuggling routes and the WHO FCTC IPT requirements
[normal],
[normal] there would however be advantage in ensuring joint or fully compatible implementati
[normal]on of compliant control systems in 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] and the 
[normal]UK
[normal].
