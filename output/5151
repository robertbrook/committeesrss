default  
default&#xa0;
defaultIn summary t
defaulthis positive impact would result from:
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat is a secure track and trace system?default&#xa0;default5.    
defaultA secure track and trace system 
defaultbegins by securely marking a unit of product (e.g. a pack of cigarettes) and
default assigning 
defaultto 
defaultit a unique identity which is stored in a government owned and controlled database
default.
default This can be done in such a way as to provide a 
defaultfully reliable 
defaulttest of authenticity and to be information rich (linked to data about e.g. product 
defaulttype
default, time and place of manufacture, intended market of sale
default et al
default). The unique identity 
defaultand the database are 
defaultthe building block
defaults
default of a tracking capability which allows the unit to be followed throughout the supply chain -
default if required 
defaultup 
defaultto 
defaultthe point of sale to the consumer. 
default 
defaultThey also provide
default the means to tra
defaultce backwards 
defaultin real-time 
defaultto point of origin

default 
defaultat anytime during the product lifecycle.
default 
defaultA properly secure system is essential to meet the challenge of ever more sophisticated organised crime groups.default&#xa0;
defaultThe key componentsdefault&#xa0;default6.    
defaultThe 
defaultquality of the marking system is keydefault. 
defaultMarks that are properly secure and well-designed
default to meet the needs of the different stakeholders
default, such as those recommended by SICPA, 
defaultare easy to use, 
defaultmake counterfeiting virtually impossible
default and provide information that enables enforcement
default. 
defaultWe assess that the current 
defaultUK
default protection system (which 
defaultwe understand 
defaultcombines a
defaultn easy-to-copy black ink 
default‘
defaultUK
default tax paid’ mark combined with a material
default-based
default feature on the tear tape) to be 
defaultrelatively 
defaultweak. 
defaultMoreover 
defaultillicit cigarettes in 
defaulth

default difficult 
defaultfor enforcers 
defaultto identify in real-time and need to be verified by manufacturers
default,
default which 
defaultcan cause
default inconvenience and delay
default.
default&#xa0;
default7.    
defaultSICPA 
defaultrecommends 
defaulta 
defaultmulti-layered approach combining material-based defaultsecurity defaultfeaturesdefault (security inks which are both visible and invisible)
default,
default defaultIT securitydefault featuresdefault (2D secure matrix, visible and/or invisible)
default and 
defaultforensic featuresdefault.  
defaultSecure o
defaultvert features can be seen by consumers thus encouraging good citizenship; additional semi-covert features can be made available to e.g. retailers so they can protect themselves from unscrupulous suppliers; covert features can be verified by enforcers using bespoke checking equipment and used as evidence.
default&#xa0;
default8.    
defaultBoth domestically produced 
default(including for export if required) 
defaultand imported product can be marked
default,
default but by definition it is only possible to mark product which is produced in a
default declared/leg
defaultitimate manufacturing facility
default and/or
default legitimately imported
default. This does not mean (as some manuf
defaultacturers might claim) that the
default 
defaultimplementation of such a system ha
defaults 
defaultno impact on the black and grey
default markets
default (where product moves between illegitimate and legitimate channels)
default. Illegal product (i.e. produced illegally such as ‘illicit whites’ or illegal by 
defaultvirtue of being non-tax paid) would be
default immediately identifiable
default to all stakeholders
default by the absence of the appropriate secure mark. 
defaultChecks by enforcers 
default(linked back in real-time to the national database
default and able to share with and interact with other government databases
default) 
defaultproduce data not only to answer the question ‘
defaultis this genuine or not

defaultTechniques for e
defaultxploit
defaulting data are progressing every day
default and
default,
default as more data is collected over-time
default,
default become ever more powerful
default. Data analysis and automated comparison of different data sets can identify patterns and anomalies which allow enforcers to make interventions against targets that would otherwise not have been spotted
default and to identify changes in criminal behaviours. It also allows performance management of enforcer interventions (e.g. by locality or type)

defaultInternational agreementsdefault&#xa0;default10.    
defaultThe 
defaultUK
default was an adopting party to the Protocol of the WHO 
defaultFCTC
default to 
default‘
defaultEliminate the Illicit Trade in Tobacco 
defaultP
defaultroducts
default’
default in 
defaultSeoul
default in November 2012. 
defaultAs on so many topics where the 
defaultUK
default has taken the lead, what the 
defaultUK
default does in relation to the Protocol will be watched by other countries and followed by them.
default Much of the 
defaultUK
default’s problem has its origin overseas
default (‘upstream’)
default and proper implementation in these countries would positively impact on the 
defaultUK
default.
default&#xa0;
default11.    
defaultThe Protocol recognises the crucial 
defaultglobal 
defaultdimension of the illicit trade in tobacco products
default and the need to ensure international co-operation and joint working
default. Among the measures agreed is
default,
default in
default A
defaultrticle 8 of the Protocol
default,
default 
defaultthe requirement to implement national track and trace systems which are globally inter-operabledefault. The Protocol foresees a five year period after coming into force for compliant national systems to be in place. 
defaultIn order to maximise value for money and longevity it 
defaultis import
defaultant that any system foreseen in the 
defaultUK
default take
defaults
default full account of the 
defaultprovisions
default of the Protocol
default, which includes the requirement that any system be

defaultCommon approachesdefault between Ireland and UKdefault&#xa0;
default13.    
defaultThe Committee has specifically noted its interest in the interrelationship between 
defaultIreland
default and the 
defaultUK
default. 
defaultIreland
default currently has a
default tax stamp 
defaultcontaining security features 
defaultbut no track and trace functionality. We believe 
defaultthat in the absence of a decision in the 
defaultUK
default to follow suit, 
defaultthe implementation of standardised packaging in 
defaultIreland
default is likely to have little short term impact
default 
defaultin the 
defaultUK
default.
default Irish tax pa
defaultid product (in contras
defaultt to tax paid product in some other EU countries) is at least as expensive as 
defaultUK
default tax paid product and not attractive to illicit traders. It is possible that implementation of standardised packages may encourage a ris
defaulte in counterfeit product which imitates the standardised packs but this is likely to be essentially an Irish problem. These packs could be traded in 
defaultNorth
defaultern
default Ireland
default and other parts of the 
defaultUK
default, but they would be clearly identifiable as non-UK tax paid. In the longer term and in view of proximity, current smuggling routes and the WHO FCTC IPT requirements
default,
default there would however be advantage in ensuring joint or fully compatible implementati
defaulton of compliant control systems in 
defaultIreland
default and the 
defaultUK
default.
