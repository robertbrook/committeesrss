[[[&#xa0;]]]My background in heavy and light electrical and mechanical engineering manufacturing of motors transformers switchgear turbines and generators coupled with my subsequent specialist area of heat network and heating system design and specification work led to my interest in utilizing reject heat from electricity generation and other low CO2 heat sources for the heating of buildings.  &#xa0;I instigated the Combined Heat and Power Association and advised the Select Committee on Energy for their 1983 and 1986 reports.  We have worked with economists and other experts on more than six national energy studies and have carried out heat sector and CHP due diligence, acted for EBRD. carrying out due diligence for heat sector work and CHP and are thus familiar with a number of different models for analysing CHP and their defects.  &#xa0;Our most recent work was an EU and EST grant aided research project to optimize heat network design to retrofitting our domestic sector to heat networks.  A demonstration retrofit condensing domestic district heat 500kW CHP installation for 423 flats in Lambeth was funded.  Our original intention was for it to be operated and actively managed by UK Power Networks to demonstrate voltage and power factor control as well as island mode operation, to partially secure local electricity supply under conditions of transmission failure.&#xa0;Our report sets out reasons why heat networks with temperatures of 75C flow and 30C return are likely to be optimal for retrofitting the domestic sector for base load operation where heat comes from steam turbine CHP.  We raise the temperature 90C flow for supplies on the coldest days using dual fuel gas/oil fired engine CHP installed to back up the 10GW of wind forecast for 2050.  The temperatures reflect current Danish practice and the heating system for the city of Odense where coal fired CHP is decarbonising domestic sector buildings with domestic gas boilers by connecting them to district heat.&#xa0;

[[[ the power sector?]]]&#xa0;On the 24th or August we submitted a letter to Ed Davey ref copied to Tim Yeo Committee Chairman, Phillip Lowe Director General for Energy at the European Commission, Professor David Mackay, and Dr Fatih Birol Chief Economist and Director of the International Energy agency expressing serious concerns about the analytical methods used by the EU emission trading scheme EUETS adopted by the UK for Electricity Market Reform.&#xa0;A paper given to the International Association of Energy Economists which analyses EUETS, Dukes and CHPQA in detail was submitted with our letter. ref&#xa0;The formulas signal a reduction in power emissions when waste heat is used.&#xa0;The formulas assume that this, now useful, reject heat has been generated in an “imaginary” boiler.&#xa0;The imaginary fuel for the boiler is then deducted from the actual fuel being used for power generation to calculate lower emissions for electricity sector and their consumers.&#xa0;The formula results in a serious “emissions” market distortion contravening the second law of thermodynamics.&#xa0;This method was at one time used for the UK statistics “Dukes” to calculate the fuel use for electricity generation from Drax when some of the heat from condensing the steam that normally goes to the cooling towers, was diverted to grow tomatoes,&#xa0;Dukes retains elements of this methodology with its allocation of  any benefit from CHP two thirds to the heat and one third to the electricity. In practice no benefit arises for power production and electricity consumers.&#xa0;Dukes statistics are used as input to other policy models such as Markal/Times used by DECC. The Markal output may be flawed if the input is flawed.  .&#xa0;Ed Davey’s response explains that DECC sees no reason to calculate the fuel or the CO2 overhead for the respective heat and electrical products from CHP.&#xa0;In our opinion such information is essential for any analysis or modelling of heat networks.  The following table provides information on the relative CO2 emissions from a selection of a sample of the heat sources we review in our paper Ref 2 page 44.

[[[0.001]]]&#xa0;EUETS and EMR would signal CO2 emissions overhead for heat from a CCGT CHP a counter factual boiler of 0.255 kg of CO2 per kWh.  The actual CO2 emissions for the heat from CHP based on its COP or Z factor of 12 will be 0.040 kg of CO2 per kWh after allowing a 20% loss of heat from the heat network.&#xa0;Our concerns are endorsed by Arnaud Duvielguerbigny Head of Policy COGEN Europe who writes “civil servants must first understand the flaws of the current system”. &#xa0;Our concerns are further endorsed in a recent report from the EU Joint Research Centre in Petten &#xa0;Our response to Ed Davey dated the 16th of December Ref copied to the committee includes poster identifying the relative merits of heat supply from CHP and insulation measures and the relative merits of heat from electric heat pumps as analysed today and by Energy Paper 35. &#xa0;

[[[The EU Carnot method for analysing Renewable CHP.]]]&#xa0;Page 16 to 18 Ref 2 explain how the EU Carnot “Exergy” method for the analysis of renewable CHP disadvantages low temperature district heating by assuming it operates at 150C.&#xa0;We further identify an error in the formula as when it allocates emissions the total emissions after allocation are greater than the actual emissions from the fuel input to the CHP.&#xa0;

[[[Analysis of the fo]]]

[[[rmula for the EU CHP directive and thermodynamic superiority of heat from CHP compared to heat from electric heat pumps.]]]&#xa0;We analyse the EU directive which was formulated on the basis that CHP reduced electricity sector emissions hence the idea of good quality electricity from CHP and an incentive on the electricity production not the heat illustrated in the following chart on Page 34 Ref 2                                       &#xa0;Note the actual primary energy savings for the heat sector are illustrated by the red triangles.&#xa0;The EU directive signals the savings by the blue line a combination of two different products where there are not savings in the electricity sector only savings in the heat sector with the blue line showing the overall saving for the combined sectors.&#xa0;Reject heat from electricity generation is a major energy resource always at a higher temperature than the environment for its rejection in line with the second law.&#xa0;This reject heat exceeds UK domestic gas energy supply in quantity but not in quality and exergy. Exergy allows the fundamental relative “value” of power and heat to be assessed and is an important concept for optimal use of scarce fuel resources.&#xa0;CHP, a “Virtual heat pump” (ref  &amp; ref ) , can in practice decarbonize dwellings heated by gas retrofitted as at Odense in Denmark to the coal fired CHP and district heat where ten units of waste heat are upgraded using one unit of electricity.  The ten is directly comparable to coefficients of performance for air source electric heat pumps of two to four driven by the plants electricity.

[[[ed CHP hub concept.]]]&#xa0;We have been researching where domestic sector modelling of heat networks is being done within the DECC structure so our energy hub concept reviewed by Greg Barker can now be modelled.&#xa0;Our current information from Jon Saltmarsh Science and Innovation see email exchanges, is not currently being done by his department or Dr Roger Lampert and Fernley Symons who interface Ricardo-AEA for Dukes and other input on CHP. We understand work is also being done by Jonathan Roberts for the Chief Economist.  Other work has been or is being done by various other consultants such as ETI the Climate Change Committee and their subcontractors.&#xa0;We have found no consistent approach to the modelling of CHP and heat networks or its assumptions.  We further found that contracts between DECC and external consultants meant that DECC officials do not have access to the internal workings and algorithms in models.  This applied to exchanges with officials in relation to work by Ricardo-AEA for the department.

[[[models.]]]&#xa0;We note Ricardo-AEA use a 15% real rate of return for information feeding into the DECC Monte Carlo model.&#xa0;We have noted Delta Energy use a 10% real rate of return to evaluate the heat infrastructure in their work for the Energy Networks Association and National Grid.&#xa0;Whilst one can identify anomalies in outputs from models such as a saving in the electricity sector with CHP or cost of heat from CHP heat network to consumers higher than cost of heat from gas boilers Delta Energy. One cannot gain access to model to check the assumptions that determine the results. Or whether the modeller has cross subsidised electricity consumers from heat consumers.&#xa0;&#xa0;To indicate how easy it can be to change the output of a model by changing lifetime and real rates of return the following table illustrates the effect by presenting the information in the form of an equivalent payback on the investment.&#xa0;We would as an example expect a low temperature heat network to have a lifetime of over 100 years and be assessed at the same rate of return as other infrastructure investments such as incremental insulation or investment in extension of gas and electricity infrastructure or storage, funded by consumers.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;One can see that the Ricardo-AEA 15% assumption will require the heat network to pay back with a lifetime of 60 years in 6.67 years for low CO2 heat supply.For an insulation measure with a 60 year life evaluated at 3.5% for inclusion as a building regulation measure the payback is 24.94 years.The Delta Energy assumption of 10% requires a 9.97 year pay back on the heat network and a 7.6 year payback every time a new gas boiler is installed at the end of its 15 year lifetime.&#xa0;Currently it appears different models make different assumptions.  We have concentrated in this evidence on modelling areas where the boiler displacement method is used by modellers and the EU.&#xa0;The Pathways modelling by DECC uses the correct power plant displacement method with an assumption of COP of 7 for heat from CHP and we note that the latest CIBSE guide AM12 also endorses this method of analysis.&#xa0;We recommend that any modelling of the energy sector has a clear list of costs and lifetimes for the elements that are modelled and where the model is dealing with CHP and its joint products a clear example of how the respective fuel and CO2 overheads for the two products have been calculated in the model.&#xa0;

[[[?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Heat networks are the most common form of heat supply in the UK where water is the vehicle for carrying the heat from its source to its destination mainly to perform three heating functions. One to provide domestic hot water, two to heat the air we breathe the ventilation heat load, three to counteract heat loss through the fabric of the building the “fabric load”.&#xa0;Often the importance of the domestic hot water and ventilation loads are forgotten as well as the electric loads for dishwashing and laundry that can be met either from district heat or electricity.

[[[Subject:]]] RE: Percentage Savings and comparisons.&#xa0;Dear William&#xa0;This is a very informative way you have presented the calculation of the efficiency of CHP and insulation.It also explains why the building insulation factories in e.g. Denmark do not like DH and CHPIt illustrates that there is a competition between the various methods to provide good indoor comfort.It also illustrates why strong commercial interests in the electricity, gas and building material sector in general are against DH and CHP.The consumers and their democratic elected representative are among the few who have interest in DH and CHP&#xa0;I have added some remarks to the calculation&#xa0;Med venlig hilsen

[[[Anders Dyrelund]]]&#xa0;Anders remarks read as follows&#xa0;&#xa0;The detailed spreadsheet has been supplied to the committee to illustrate why the low carbon heat supply option offers such high savings compared to fabric insulation.&#xa0;The relative impact of low CO2 heat supply and demand side measures is illustrated in a paper to the solar trade association and its poster as well as results illustrated below from a retrofit for the future project.&#xa0;In our paper we propose Modular Energy Hubs incorporating 500 kW-2000kW CHP, heat pumps, fuel and heat stores, with battery storage and exchange for Electric Vehicles. The Hubs optimize intermittent renewable electricity from wind and solar PV, minimizing electrical infrastructure investment for 2050.  Large scale solar thermal feeds the 75C flow 30C return heat networks. The concept has been discussed with Greg Barker and we understand it will be modelled by DECC.&#xa0;We suggest that when heat from fossil CHP has a lower CO2 footprint i.e. higher COP than electric heat pumps it should be treated as qualifying for the same incentives as heat from “renewable” biomass and electric heat pumps’&#xa0;The paper submitted to Ed Davey explains that electric heat pumps can generate higher CO2 emissions than fossil CHP, where electricity for the heat pump is fossil-derived. Also CO2 emissions when wood is burnt on a grate are larger than emissions from coal.  Whilst the sustainable element associated with the wood has to be considered current regulations by treating its emissions as zero independent of the efficiency of the conversion of the wood to energy resulting in poor use of a scarce resource.   &#xa0;WRH Orchard December 2013&#xa0; Letter Edward Davey Secretary of State for Energy 24th August 2013 IAEE conference Paper Dusseldorf Edward Davey Response 14th October 2013 See document “OP relevant email correspondence heat sector CHP and Renewables 2008-2013  European Commission Joint Research Centre Background Report on EU-27 District Heating and Cooling Potentials, Barriers, Best Practice and Measures of Promotion  Report EUR 25289 EN David Andrews, Anna Krook Riekkola Evangelos Tzimas Joana Serpa Johan Carlsson Nico Pardo-Garcia Ioulia Papaioannou Letter Reply to Edward Davey dated 16th December 2013  Professor Robert Lowe, UCL Energy Institute, London, WC1H 0NN Combined heat and power considered as a virtual steam cycle heat pump.
