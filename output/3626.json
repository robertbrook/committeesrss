"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from\n A \nCordiner\n (HSR 018)\n&#xa0;I ordinarily act in capacity as HS2 delegate for Hyde Heath Village Society, I have not been able to meet with the \nSociety C\nommittee at \nshort notice to seek their approval to this submission\n and this is therefore a personal submission. \nI would h\no\npe that the \nTransport \nC\nommittee \nunderstands that at present the Village Society \nis\n inundated with Government Consultation response work and we do \nnot have the appropriate amount of time or resources to respond adequately.\n As a general comment, HS2 and the government are overloading and placing great strain on our Villages personnel\n as a consequence of their methods of operation\n. \n&#xa0;\nMy questions relat\ne to the strategic case for HS2 which our society intend to question in the Final Environmental Statement and if necessary with a petition during the petitioning process. Some or all of my submission will be included in the formal HHVS submission to these \ncommittees at a later date. \n&#xa0;\nI should also record; I have raised many of these matters with \nHS2 Ltd, \nthe \nSecretary of State, the \nScrutiny Committee investigation into HS2 and have had \nlittle or \nno response. Given the seriousness of the matters raised I wo\nuld hope you will take this further in liaising with other Parliamentary Committees before reaching conclusions on this :-\n&#xa0;\nQuestions â€“ \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
