defaultWhy this recession has hit young people harddefault&#xa0;
defaultThis recession has seen a reduction in hiring, rather than an increase in people losing their jobs. 
defaultJob creation happens when a workplace is newly established or 
defaultexpands;
default job destruction when one contracts or closes. 
defaultUsing firm level data, 
defaultBob
default Butcher at NIESR found:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThis hits young people especially
default, because older workers can get by staying in jobs
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultLast year
default,
default 
defaultthe TUC
default worked with 
defaultthe Institute for Public Policy Research 
defaultand 
defaultthe Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development 
defaulton a project on 
defaultTackling youth 
defaultunemployment: lessons from Europe
default. 
defaultWe noted that our youth unemployment rate has consistently been about the EU average
default, both before and after the recession – but this figures hides as much as it reveals. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFirst
defaultly
default, we have a significantly above average proportion NEET – 18.4%, compared with 16.4%. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSecondly, the position of young people 
defaultrelative to older adults
default is much worse – in the UK a young person is 3.5 times as likely to be unemployed as an over-25, compared to 2.5 times in the PIGS and 1.5 times in Germany. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultTo what extent is the difficulty young people face a supply side matter?default&#xa0;defaultOverall, unemployment is a demand side issue: the key statistic is the ratio of unemployed people to job vacancies. This has now started to fall, but is still nearly twice the 2.5 : 1 that was the norm before the recession.
default&#xa0;
defaultSome of the factors frequently referred to as possible causes of youth unemployment do not
default stack up:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultFactors that may have played a part
default&#xa0;
defaultGeneration Lost
default suggests one issue may be 
defaultJobcentre Plus’s
default 2001 decision to pay less attention to youth unemployment
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the project we engaged in with IPPR and CIPD, we were struck by the fact that the difference between youth and older adult unemployment was much less noticeable in countries with 
defaultstrong vocational education and training systems. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe low rates of youth unemployment in Austria, Germany and the Netherlands highlight the importance of how the education system interacts with the world of work, and the institutional support that young people receive to make the transition between the two. As a result, policymakers across Europe increasingly stress the importance of high quality vocational education that provides structured pathways into work. One Commission official told us that 
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultit’s not an intellectual insight that when we have well-established, structured and functioning transition pathways youth unemployment is low. So the issue is not identifying the right policies, but delivering on those priorities
default.”
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition, the TUC is 
defaultvery worried about the situation with regard to careers guidance. 
defaultAccording to the OFSTED Report 
defaultGoing in the Right Direction
default 
default- careers guidance in schools is not adequate: “the new statutory duty for schools to provide careers guidance is not working well enough”. 
defaultThere have been massive 
defaultcuts in connexions services
default and 
defaultthe National Careers Service does not offer face to face careers guidance for young people – y
defaultou have to be aged 19 or over – even though r
defaultesearch has shown that young people prefer face to face guidance.
default&#xa0;
defaultOn 
default22 November
default,
default we held a TUC Apprenticeships 
defaultFocus Group attended by 
default50 
defaulta
defaultpprentices. Careers guidance received was practically non-existent
default or was 
defaultlimited 
defaultto
default “go to university”. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHow unions defaultshould responddefault&#xa0;defaultWe would
default emphasise the importance of making sure bargaining supports skills and training. Unions are encouraging employers to recruit young people, pushing to recruit young people themselves.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 
defaultUK,
default we have emphasised learning as the field where unions can make a difference. The TUC’s learning arm, unionlearn, has trained 30,000 
defaultUnion Learning Representatives (
defaultULRs
default)
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultULRs – and increasingly other union rep.s as learning becomes more mainstream (TUC education for rep.s now includes a major learning element
default) –
default have negotiated Learning Agreements: 209 since April 2012. These cover such issues as equality &amp; diversity statements, time off for ULRs, setting up workplace learning committees and learning centres, special provision in English and maths, helping people move on to higher level qualifications, the investment employers will make. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWith 
defaultthe 
defaultlast 
defaultgovernment,
default we worked on the New Deal and the Future Jobs Fund to help minimise objections
default from existing workers and reduce 
defaultdisplacement and substitution. We h
defaultad 
defaultan 
defaultAgreement with the 
defaultEmployment Service covering the
default New Deal, 
defaulttook part in the
default panels
default awarding Future Jobs Fund contracts and we established a
default network of union officials dealing with 
defaultthe 
defaultFJF
default to troubleshoot any problems with abuse of the programme (though this turned out to be rare)
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultAt 
defaultEuropean 
defaultlevel, the 
defaultemployers’
default organisations and the ETUC have a plan for social dialogue negotiations. We regard youth unemployment as 
defaulta priority
default 
defaultand
default made a 
default“Framework of actions on youth employment”
default our first priority for the 2012-14 round. There are dozens of agreed actions relating to learning, transitions, employment and entrepreneurship. 
default&#xa0;
defaultActive labour market programmes default&#xa0;
defaultAlthough the publicity for the YC has emphasised the employer subsidy, the bulk is made up of work experience placements: there have been 136,000 work experience placements through the Youth Contract. Next most important have been the sector-based academies, with 49 per cent of the 61,000 people starting these courses being aged 18 – 24. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBy May 2013 (one third of the way through the programme), there had been 21,460 starts on jobs supported by the wage incentive. I
defaultnterim and final payments had been made in respect of 4,690 people, including 2,070 payments for completing the full 26 weeks.
default&#xa0;
defaultBetween May 2011 and Feb 2013, 146,810 people were referred to Mandatory Work Activity, 43 per cent of whom were 18 – 24 year olds. The DWP’s 2012 research into the 
defaultEarly Impacts of Mandatory Work Activity
default found 
defaultthat 
default“
defaultMWA had a small and transitory impact on benefit receipt, and no impact on employment
default”
default&#xa0;
defaultThe TUC strongly supports a job guarantee, like the Future Jobs Fund. 
defaultIt is important
default to remember 
defaultthat the Future Jobs Fund 
defaultwas set up at an extremely unpropitious time – no-one was creating jobs at this point and there were major job losses being announced every day. The 2011 evaluation by 
defaultFishwick et al
default found that
default this one scheme accounted for over a fifth of the exits from JSA among long-term unemployed young people, over two fifths at its busiest time and 60 per cent in the most disadvantaged parts of the country.  
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultOf the 105,220 participants who started FJF jobs between 2009 and 2011, an estimated 15 per cent of them left their job before six months – more often than not to move immediately into another job. Overall, an estimated 43 per cent of participants obtained a job outcome after FJF – in the majority of cases with the same employer as their FJF job.
default”
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultevaluation for the DWP carried out by NIESR in 2012
default found that, two years after participating, people were 7% less likely to be on benefit – and as this reduction was stable it was likely to be sustained – a problem for active labour market policies. It increased the likelihood of being in unsubsidised employment 2 years after participation by 10 points, again, this seemed likely to be sustained. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe programme benefited participants by £1,600 net per head, their employers by £6,850 per participant. It cost the Exchequer £3,100 per participant net, but produced a net benefit to society of £7,750 per participant – mostly due to their economic output while in FJF employment plus their subsequent extra unsubsidised employment.
default&#xa0;
defaultIf the employment effect of the programme persists beyond the two years after participation covered by the study, the benefit to society could be as high as £15,000. Even on the most conservative 
defaultassumptions,
default the net befit to participants was £1,600, to employers was £3,750 and to society was £1,100, whilst the net Exchequer cost was £4,300.
default&#xa0;
defaultThese assumptions included that the output produced by FJF workers had no value and that the employment effects of the programme ceased immediately after the study stopped tracking participants.
default 
default&#xa0;defaultIt is v
defaultery sad that the UK is the 
defaultonly EU member state that has said it will not implement the Youth Guarantee
default. Unlike most of the richer MSs, 
defaultwe are not
default adding 
defaultnational
default fund
defaulting
default to the European Youth Initiative either.
