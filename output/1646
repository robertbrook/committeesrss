[normal] and First Trust Bank in

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The governance structure for the bank is established at a 
[normal]UK
[normal] level. AIB Group (UK) 
[normal]p.l.c
[normal]  has
[normal] its own Board and Audit Committee. First Trust 
[normal]B
[normal]ank is represented on the board by the Head of the
[normal] First Trust 
[normal]Bank b
[normal]usiness.  Reporting into the board are a number of executive level committees dealing with strategy and business performance, 
[normal]r
[normal]isk issues, 
[normal]c
[normal]ustomer issues and 
[normal]c
[normal]hange management. All of these committees operate on a 
[normal]UK
[normal] wide basis with representation from First Trust Bank.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]First Trust Bank and AIB 
[normal](
[normal]GB
[normal])
[normal] have their own Leadership Teams responsible for implementing the respective business strategies.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]AIB 
[normal](
[normal]GB
[normal])
[normal] and First Trust 
[normal]B
[normal]ank have quite different customer bases. AIB 
[normal](
[normal]GB
[normal])
[normal] is a niche player in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] market focusing on the SME market and particularly on businesses with Irish trade links. First Trust Bank offers a mass market retail banking service
[normal] and also focuses on the SME market with a Business Banking proposition

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is no disadvantage to the banks personal or business customers in 
[normal]N

[normal]

[normal] as a result of the governance structures outlined above. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There have been a number of ‘Access to Finance’ surveys in recent years

[normal] Finance Guarantee
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]First Trust Bank offers funding secured (in part or in whole) by guarantees under the Enterprise Finance Guarantee (EFG) Scheme (since 
[normal]April 20
[normal]09). Our participation in the scheme is regularly advertised to staff members to assist in providing suitable lev
[normal]els of funding for their clients. All guarantees were provided at 75% of the approved funding. The guarantees are provided subject to portfolio caps. The cap is agreed between the lending institution and EFG and is based upon the level of new business writ
[normal]ten annually. Aggregate amount of guarantees available to First Trust Bank customers is limited to 15% of the first £1,000,000 of new business and 9.25% of any further new business.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Applications for funding are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, with 
[normal]e
[normal]ligibility determined by the EFG eligibility criteria. Parameters for EFG are borrowings between £25,001 and £1,000,000. Availability of the funding supported by EFG is accordingly restricted by these amounts and the operation of portfolio caps
