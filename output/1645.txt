[[[Introduction]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[General comments]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The study showed that pathways without CCS would require exceptional levels of power from nuclear and renewables – to support increased electrification of the heating and transport sectors. The development of low-carbon heat networks with CHP would soon become limited due to emissions constraints and the absence of CCS would have a significant impact on the potential for wide-scale roll-out of hydrogen as a fuel source for low-carbon heat.&#xa0;&#xa0;
