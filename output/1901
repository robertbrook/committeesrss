[normal]1. 
[normal]My unique expertise in women’s sport
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Women’s football has been a huge part of my life so far. At the age of seven, I signed for
[normal] 
[normal]Arsenal Ladies FC, represented London at county level and joined the England youth squad a few years later. All of which gave me an unusual first-hand sociological perspective on a range of women and girls’ issues regarding sport. On international duty, I directly experienced various countries’ cultural attitudes towards female sports. For example, the Nordic sport models success is evident in Denmark, Sweden and Norway. Nordic countries boast a welfare policy on the organisation of sport and this is not surprising; successfully introducing special elite sport systems, which arguably violate the traditional sporting values but succeed in the vast growth of interest and participation in female sports. At 17 I undertook a full, combined athletic &amp; academic scholarship to study and play college football in North Carolina, USA. Returning from the USA, I studied BA Philosophy and graduated July 2013. After graduation I completed an internship in policy with the Women’s Sport &amp; Fitness Foundation before taking a job at The Football Association (The FA) researching and analysing participation levels across the National Game. In October 2013 I will begin a one-year Masters at Cambridge University where I will research law and policy surrounding gender discrimination in sport and education.

[normal]2. The American game changer
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Football in the UK is immersed in sexism. However, the US offers a
[normal] 
[normal]hugely contrasting narrative. Title IX, for example, is a part of the United States of
[normal] 
[normal]America's Education Amendments of 1972. 
[normal]Also identified as the 'Equal Opportunity
[normal] 
[normal]in Education Act'.
[normal] Amongst other things, Title IX requires that schools allocate participation opportunities in a non-discriminatory way. Britain currently has no such law. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. Broadly speaking, Title IX requires that schools receiving state funds must provide female students with equal opportunities to participate in educational programs, including Physical Education. Because of Title IX, 
[normal]US
[normal] girls and women are playing sports at an earlier age and in much greater numbers than ever before. Since Title IX was passed, the number of girls participating in secondary school athletics has increased dramatically: from fewer than three hundred thousand to nearly three million - an increase from 7% to nearly 41%. Title IX has revolutionised all aspects women’s sports in the US, as well as bettering the lives of women and girls more widely. Title IX is a law 
[normal]designed
[normal] to provide equality of opportunity for young women. Title IX is a law that changed lives.
[normal]4. 
[normal]What is possible in 
[normal]Britain
[normal]The privation of this law in Britain means that no piece of legislation successfully ensures that schools’ expenditure on sport benefits girls and boys equally. There is overwhelming anecdotal 
[normal]evidence that funding in the UK is given primarily to boys’ sports in schools. Such evidence remains anecdotal because the allocation or gender impact of spending is not appropriately measured, if at all. 
[normal]The Government funds sport and physical education vastly, but does not succeed in setting equality targets that ensure this public money is used to benefit females to the same extent as it benefits males. 
[normal]This in itself highlights a fundamental flaw in the process and, if correct, locates issues of potentially systematic exclusion. 
[normal]5. Outside of schools and more widely, The Equality Act 2010 contains provisions on positive action. However, it does not require that publicly funded sport provide for equal numbers of males and females. Whilst there is scope for improved gender equality practice within the Act, the gender equality crisis in British sport suggests that national governing bodies and public authorities are not utilising this scope as opportunity to reduce disadvantage. 
[normal]6. The taxpayer’s pound should leverage equality. Therefore, I wish to present a case for introducing a legislative change to the UK in order to concretely better the lives of British women and girls. British state schools are considered to be a public authority, and although there is ambiguity about what this means for academies, it is reasonable to understand that most state schools should comply with Public Sector Equality Duty. There is room here then, to better ensure equal opportunities in education are being implemented and enforced. A potential modification to the Equality Act 2010 looks as if it may act as an ethically and politically appropriate vehicle to introduce a British equivalent to this law. Title IX is not just about sporting opportunity. A similar law in Britain has the capacity to enhance social, economic, and physiological aspects of life for women and girls in the UK. The privation of a British equivalent locates a fundamental flaw in female rights in Britain, as well as our contemporary concept of equality. An equivalent policy could re-construct an imbalanced, mismanaged aspect of Britain’s education system. A change in the law has the capacity to take down the wall between government desires and children in the playground, working politically and strategically to build a framework of equality in the very architecture of Britain’s educational context.
[normal]7. If legislative change was achieved, it looks as if the Youth Sport Trust could potentially be an appropriate organisation to act as the infrastructure that monitors funding allocation, resource and opportunity in terms of gender equality.
[normal]8. Participation rates between men and women are unequal across the country. It is not implausible to suggest that unequal funding, opportunity and/or resource in schools is, in many aspects playing an instrumental role in the current crisis amongst girls sport and physical education, and later, women’s sport and physical activity. The wider impact of this includes, amongst other things, the creation and maintenance of unequal power dynamics amongst male and female children within school sport and P.E and later, amongst men and women in sporting contexts in wider society.
[normal]9. Ideally the UK would find a similar legal remedy to the USA’s Title IX. 
[normal]At this stage 
[normal]I would ask the
[normal] Select Committee not to recommen
[normal]d the US requirements, but
[normal] to recommend that further research is carried out on the topic. Although I have some ideas which are entirely plausible, I am going to Cambridge University in October this year to do more research and test out what will actually work back in reality to provide strategy and structure that will lead to 
[normal]objective and measurable change. I will complete my research in June 2014 and would very much like to report back in more detail next year.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10. One year on from the greatest ever Olympic games for women seems a fitting opportunity to build on its legacy. However, we live in a culture where The Equality Act fails to meaningfully address the debate surrounding male-only golf clubs; the BBC showed nothing but apathy over John Inverdale’s unacceptable comments about Marion Bartoli at Wimbledon; Rachel Yankey became the most-capped British footballer of all time and received almost no media attention what so ever; national newspapers created headlines about Wimbledon that forgot championship wins from fellow Brits who were female; Holger Osieck said in a press conference that “women should shut up in public”; Primark sold slogan tops to children reading ‘future footballer’s wife’. This is not an acceptable norm and a change in the law would not solve this problem alone, but its guarantee of equal access to sports would, at a foundational level positively permeate an all-too familiar vicious circle surrounding women and girls’ identity and relationship with physical education and sport. 
[normal]11. The government needs to re-examine physical education programs to 
[normal]ensure
[normal] that schools are treating their female students fairly with respect to participation opportunities, facilities and investment. Resource allocation alone is not enough. A change in the law would force questions to be asked about existing practices, goals, assumptions and relationships with and within our education system
[normal]. The government must acknowledge that the current school P.E and sport structure is not gender-equal regarding funding, opportunity and resource and that this is having a corrosive impact on girls - holding them back in many aspects of life, as girls now and as women in the future. Progress is difficult in the abstract, confronting this successfully, with real, pragmatic affect, cannot be done without concrete change. Gender equality is not an add-on job. Legislative change would insist on schools having an initial, institutional equality as a pre-condition of the ability to create change on the ground. Legal duty would see equality built into the very framework of schools’ decision-making process as a foundation, not an after-thought. Furthermore, legislative duty would prevent individuals with objectives to get more girls into school sport and P.E getting overwhelmed in their own schools compulsions because such law would be an institutional, collective duty. Finally, legislation would be centrally monitored - preventing equality policies getting lost in bureaucracy between parliament meeting rooms and school playing fields. 
[normal] 
[normal]12. I would relish the opportunity to illustrate the importance of legislative change that would successfully modify Britain’s education and sporting structures for women and girls, and indeed how this may impact society more widely.
