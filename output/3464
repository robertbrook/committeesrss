defaultSelect Committee Effectiveness
default 
defaultreport.
default The Environmental Audit Committee has agreed the following note.
defaultAction on the Liaison Committee’s recommendations
defaultWe have 
defaultcontinued our practice of
default annual “awaydays” 
default(
defaultwithin the Parliamentary estate
default)
default to review our working methods and effectiveness. 
defaultAs we mentioned in our submission to the Liaison Committee last year, we
default used our 2011 awayday to set an aim for the Parliament of testing the extent to which the Government is
default, in the Prime Minister’s words,
default the “greenest government ever” within cont
defaultext of sustainable development. 
defaultThat sustainable development agenda has been an underlying theme of all of our work. We
default 
defaultmade a commitment in a report
default 
defaultin May 2011 
defaultto 
defaultcontinue to 
defaultaudit the Government’s performance 
defaultunder its new systems for
default 
defaultembedding sustainable development
default across departments, focusing on the central oversight of Defra and the Cabinet Office, and in June 2013 we made another commitment to extend that scrutiny to look at sustainability in individual departments. With significant audit and briefing support from the NAO, we have examined the position in BIS [and will soon be examining the Home Office.] The BIS audit prompted that department to fill a vacant ‘sustainability champion’ post and we understand from the NAO and Defra that other departments, faced with NAO/EAC audits, are refining their sustainable development structures and processes. 
defaultOur commitment to scrutinise sustainable development extended to the international 
defaultstage, continuing our long-running examination of the UN Rio+20 Earth Summit
default. 
defaultIn our inquiry on the outcomes of the summit, w
defaulte 
defaultsought
default unsuccessfully to take oral evidence from the Deputy Prime Minister as the leader of the UK delegation at 
defaultthe Summit
default. He told us that he had given evidence on political and constitutional reform, for which he had special responsibility, and did not wish to set a precedent of giving evidence to committees on other areas. He agreed to meet us informally, accompanied by 
defaultother
default ministers, but this proved difficult to arrange. Instead, we asked the Liaison Committee to take evidence from the Deputy Prime Minister
default, and
default 
defaultt
defaulthat session
default took place
default in February 2013
default. That session
default inevitably covered a range of issues, which allowed only a brief examination of his role 
defaulton Rio+20, but in the process we have opened up a vehicle for scrutinising the work of the DPM more directly. 
defaultWe used an external trainer 
defaultat that 2011 awayday 
defaultto review our performance in conducting oral evidence sessions and to advise on improveme
defaultnts, and s
defaulthe also facilitated an assessment of how we might conduct sessions more effectively and the clerks 
defaultimprove our
default briefs. 
defaultWe understand that, following her work for us, other committees have since also used her skills in this way. 
defaultWe reviewed ou
defaultr communications/press strategy in 2011, and have revisited that each awayday since
default. 
defaultWe immediately followed suit when the Liaison Committee began differentiating conclusions from recommendations in reports. We have also sought to produce fewer, more tightly focused 
defaultrecommendations:
default since our March 2012 submission our reports have averaged eleven recommendations, and since the Liaison Committee report less than nine. 
defaultWe have, since our March 2012 submission, 
defaulttagged
default our reports and evidence six times: three times for debates in Westminster Hall and three times in the Chamber. 
defaultCommittee staff have examined the extent of the Government’s implementation of those of our recommendations that were accepted by Government in Session 2010-12 (we will soon extend that analysis to later 
defaultsessions). This showed that for one report — on 
defaultAir Quality
default — the Government has shown signs of going back on its acceptance of two recommendations, including the
default Government’s “absolutely clear ... opposition to a third runway at Heathrow”.
defaultThe ‘core tasks’
defaultAs we discussed in our March 2012 submission to the Liaison Committee, our departmentally cross-cutting remit to examine sustainable development makes many of the ‘core tasks’ difficult or inappropriate for us. We do not have a single department whose finances and administration we can scrutinise. Indeed, we have continued to examine the role of more than one department in nearly all of our inquiries. Our 
defaultGreen Economy
default inquiry, for example, covered four departments (Defra, BIS, DECC and Treasury) and 
defaultProtecting the Arctic
default three departments (DECC, Transport and FCO), and in the course of our inquiries since April last year we have covered the work of eight departments. 
defaultAs before, however, we have continued to examine Government policies at an early stage when more readily amenable to change. Our reports on the 
defaultEnergy Intensive Industries Compensation Scheme
default and 
defaultSustainable Development Indicators
default, and ongoing inquiries on 
defaultBiodiversity Offsetting
default and the 
defaultCode for Sustainable Homes
default, all respond to Government consultation exercises. 
defaultInnovative practices
defaultWe hesitate to claim what might be termed ‘innovative practices’. We would highlight the following areas.
defaultWe have endeavoured to take our work away from Westminster when appropriate, particularly when there has been a need to engage with a particular group of stakeholders. We held a seminar at St Martins-in-the-Field in May 2012 to discuss the international sustainability agenda ahead of the UN Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro the following month. Our seminar involved speakers from youth, business, environmental and faith groups as well as Mr Speaker, and took questions from the 500 members of the public present. We launched our ongoing 
defaultGreen Finance
default inquiry at another seminar at the Guildhall in the City of London, and we took formal oral evidence on that same inquiry at the new opened Headquarters of the Green Investment Bank in Edinburgh. We plan to hold a final public event at the City when we publish our report early next year. We have also continued our annual practice of meeting the finalists of the ‘Climate Week’ award scheme, to discuss their initiatives and ideas. 
defaultW
defaulte have 
defaultcontinued to benefit 
defaultgreatly from significant assistance
default from the National Audit Office
default 
defaultwhich
default 
defaultis particularly 
defaultimportant
default, as we mentioned before, because
default 
defaultwe no longer 
defaulthave support from the Sustainable Development Commission after it was wound up 
defaultin 2011
default. The NAO provide a monthly bulletin detailing developments on sustainable development, environmental protection and energy matters. The NAO has produced, at our request, very helpful briefs for our 
defaultinquiries
default on
default 
defaultCarbon Budgets
default, 
defaultProgress on Embedding Sustainable Development
default and 
defaultSustainability in BIS
default. 
defaultIt is also undertaking audits in individual departments on our behalf of their sustainability performance (see above). 
defaultWe have continued our practice of annual seminars
default 
defaultwith 
defaultacademics 
defaultand
default research
defaulters
default 
defaulthosted by the British Academy and the Sustainability Knowledge Alliance
default. 
defaultThese have provided useful insights into issues before we have formulated precise terms of reference for some inquiries
default. 
defaultWe have 
defaultalso continued
default to undertake an annual visit to Brussels for briefings on up-coming European initiatives
default tied to ongoing or prospective inquiries
default. 
defaultOur most recent visit in December 2012 allowed us to discuss evolving discussions in the European Commission on possible action on a particular type of agricultural pesticide, as part of our inquiry on 
defaultPollinators and Pesticides
default. This opened the way for us to travel to Brussels in April 2013 to discuss the proposed Commission ban on those ‘neonicitinoids’ with the Health &amp; Consumer Affairs Commissioner, who was able to take on board the findings of inquiry before that ban was finally approved. 
defaultIn that inquiry, as well as in our 
defaultProtecting the Arctic
default inquiry, we also sent copies of our report to environment committees of other European (and in the latter case to those of the Arctic states). We also persuaded the FCO to arrange for our 
defaultProtecting the Arctic
default 
defaultreport
default to be put on the agenda of a meeting of the Arctic Council.
defaultWe
default have 
defaultcontinued to make selective use of 
defaultvideo-conferencing 
defaultto take evidence
default. We 
defaulthave used this four times this Parliament, including taking formal oral evidence for our 
defaultArctic
default inquiry from Prof Richard Steiner in Alaska (9 hours behind!)
default.
