defaultNetwork Rail data on level crossings 
defaultas 
defaultreported by Laura Roberts and published by the Daily Telegraph on 18 August 2010
default. Then, 
defaultexamine the 
defaultpublished 
defaultdata using
default the Bayesian method of statistics
default to establish the reliability of level crossing user
default actions
default 
defaultand reliability of
default GB Railways’ inferences
default. 
defaultUtility of this approach is to examine whether the latest evidence of RSSB/Network Rail claim that railway accidents are a result of user’s action accords with historical observations or not?  
default&#xa0;
defaultFollowing the

defaultOral Evidences 
defaultpresented

defaultuthor is anxious that c

defaultmay be used 
defaultby GB Railway Industry 
defaultto close out 
defaultdis
default-used level crossings to satisfy anxiety o
defaultf members of public and 
defaultmedia to 
defaultmeet
default the regulatory targets without changing the underlying process of risk based decision making
default or 
defaultmake
default a 
defaultlong –term 
defaultplan to eliminate 
defaultthe dangerous assets
default of level crossings
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultPsychology of good decision making require
defaults that decision maker reflect upon the data when new or same evidence is presented again to work out whether a change of one’s own knowledge base is required or not?
default In this light, author examines the risk data publicly available.

defaultThis paper presents
default the results of examination of Network Rail published 
defaultrisk 
defaultdata on level crossings using Bayesian method of statistics as per the System for Railway Investigations Methodology (SIRI). 
defaultThis section discusses the role of human factor issu
defaultes on performance when 
defaulta
default human user interacts with level crossings. 
defaultThe discussions over societal risk by John Adams may be consulted here
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultAuthor presented the application of the Bayesian method of statistics (i.e. rules of conditional probabilities) to
default determine the quantitative reliability of train driver (human performance) in 
defaultdangerous situations in 
defaultthe form of a poster session at the IET System Safety Conference in 2010. Author had used 
defaultsimplified
default 
defaultBayesian method of statistics
default in his submission to t
defaulthe UK Law Commission Inquiry on Level Crossings(Appicharla, 2010). Author noted that Bayesian
default method can be
default applied where errors in statistical risk analysis are to be identified as suggested by Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman
default. This is
default to overcome the biase
defaults inherent in
default risk perceptions by public and experts as well. 
defaultAuthor 
defaultexplained 
defaultthis in a general way 
defaultin the Technical Review of the Common Safety Method presented at the IET System Safety Conference in October 2013
default 
defaultand in the Submission to the UK Law Commi
defaultssion in 2010 (Appicharla, 2010),
default(Appicharla, 2013)
default. 
default Complicated forms of Bayesian analysis were performed by expert statisticians to argue the case 
defaultfor 
defaultthe temperature effect of ring failures and the probability risk assessment of Space Shuttle Challenge
defaultr launch decision
default (Dalal, et al., 1989)
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultScott Adams, creator of Dilbert, writes that engineers hate risk
default (Adams, 1996)
default. Scott Adams reasons that engineers try to eliminate risk it whenever they can because media will amplify a single engineering mistake
default. Some of the examples of engineering mistakes given by Scott Adams are 
defaultHidenberg
default, Space Shuttle
default Challenger
default, Hubble space telescope, Apollo 13, Titanic, Ford Pinto, and 
defaultCorvair
default. 
defaultThe fear of killing thousands motivates engineers to eliminate risk, writes Scott Adams. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAn objection may be raised by railway executives and staff that this is a very complicated way of looking at risk
default for the fear of media 
defaultwhen deaths at level crossing
defaults are never more than double figures
default. In general, 
defaultthey argue that 
defaultorganisations and their leaders are always short of time, money and resources and do not have 
defaultenough 
defaultresources to indulge in such wishful thinking. 
defaultA j
defaultudicial test of 
defaultevaluating 
defaultcost-benefit
default analysis 
defaultof eliminating risk 
defaultprovides 
defaultus with 
defaulta satisfactory and legal ground for arriving at a decision on how much investment is to be made into safety improvements. 
defaultOpposition from employees is also a factor in decision making 
defaultprocess 
defaultand therefore, 
defaulta 
defaultcognitive appr
defaultoach to errors is a distraction. The
default attention of the executives 
defaultis a expensive resource and shall be depl
defaultoyed where
default 
defaultfar more serious decisions are to be made. 
defaultThis objection is a valid one and reader can find this type of argument in the bri
defaultef survey of literature on managerial decision making
default by Janis&amp; Mann
default. T
defaulthis strategy 
defaultcan be labelled as a quasi-
defaultsatisficing
default approach or 
defaultsatisficing
default approach to decision 
defaultmaking (
defaultL.Janis
default &amp; Mann, 1977). 
defaultHoweve
defaultr, this argument does not stand up
default to the legal scr
defaultutiny as it was examined and concluded 
defaultby the UK Law Commission 
defaultin September 2013
default that law on level crossings needs to be reformed to facilitate faster closure
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultHere is the response of the Office of Rail Regulation to 
defaultthe UK Law Commissions proposal
default. 
defaultIan
default Prosser, Director of Railway Safety at the Office of Rail Regulation, said: “The Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) welcomes the Law Commissions’ proposals to modernise level crossing legislation, which will cut red-tape and make it easier for high-risk cros
defaultsings to be closed.
default&#xa0;
default Great Britain’s level crossings, although among the safest in Europe, pose a significant rail safety risk to the public.
default&#xa0;
default That is why we have announced millions of pounds’ worth of extra funds to close or upgrade level crossings over t
defaulthe next five years, and will work to support implementation of improved level crossing laws.”
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the previous Written Evidence dated 11
defaultth
default November 2013, author has shown how the signalling engineering experts believed that 
defaultGreat Britain’s
default level crossings 
defaultare
default the safest in Europe
default and therefore, no action is needed. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBy reflecting upon the statement of the ORR’s Director of Railway Safety, author wonders whether level crossings can be categorised by risk into t
defaultwo different categories of high
default and 
defaultlow risk
default le
defaultvel crossings.  The question arises as to how to detect errors in risk 
defaultcategorisation 
defaultby industrial organisations 
defaultby comparing it to the data 
defaultpublicly available in a cost efficient manner? This paper gives an answer in relation to the UK railway level cros
defaultsings. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultFurther, a
defaultuthor wishes to counter this logic by drawing the objector’s attention to the fact that psychology of thinking and reasoning is an active research subject since the time of Aristotle
default in a recorded form
default. Aristotle argued that human beings are rational animals. This paper published by Philip N. Johnson-Laird argues that errors depend upon the mental 
defaultmodel that is
default used in reasoning in 2010
default. Philip N. Johnson-Laird argues against computational approaches t
defaulto problem solving. Therefore, reasoning is helpful guide to draw out errors in reasoning. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAuthor wishes to add that unlike errors in economic 
defaultor statistical 
defaultreasoning, the loss of life is 
defaultirreversible
default event
default 
defaultlike an incurable disease that
default 
defaulthas 
defaultno drug
default that
default can cure
default it
default. 
defaultFrom a profit perspective, one can postpone development of drugs if the development is un-profitable. Author does not think that this is a sound policy. 
defaultFurther, 
defaultsettling the debate from a stochastic analytical view point lies in ascertaining
default the type of distribution involved, 
defaultdetermine 
defaultthe spread of parameters etc and involves performing social analysis or analysis of computer stimul
defaultations
default (Dalal, et al., 1989)
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAuthor had showed how 
defaultAristotle model of three causal factors (causational 
defaultmodel
default) model
default can explain
default the adverse system event coming
default into be
defaulting. The Clapham Accident case study wa
defaults published to show the logic involved in the
default explanation
default 
defaultof the accident
default(Appicharla, 2010)
default. Author
default accepts the fact three causal factors model cannot ex
defaultplain the making of the Universe
default and this has been clarified in the NASA Challenger Case Study published by the author (
defaultAppicharla
default, 2012). 
defaultExecutive decision making i
defaultn risk assessment process used by firms is in
default itself a third factor apart from the materia
defaultl and efficient factors involved in the
default physical
default causation of accidents. 
defaultNobel Laureate Daniel 
defaultKahneman
default cautions
default the readers
default against 
defaultusage of causal intuitions when statistical thinking may be appropriate (pp77)
default (Kahneman, 2011)
default. These difficulties 
defaultintrodu
defaultced by universal religious beliefs 
defaultas pointed by 
defaultPaul Bloom and described by 
defaultNobel Laureate, Daniel 
defaultKahneman
default over physical causes, intentional and other causes do not manifest in the case of author’s 
defaultexplanation of
default the Herefordshire Level Crossing accident
default.  
defaultIt is important to note Nobel Laureate Herbert 
defaultA.Simon’s
default idea that co-relation is not causation
default (Simon, 1972)
default. The philosophy of action and inaction is extremely subtle is noted by Swami 
defaultNikhilananda
default on his commentary on the verses of 4.16, 4.17, 4.18, 
defaultand 4.19 of the ancient sacred text of Hindus, the 
defaultBhagavad
default 
defaultGita
default (Nikhilananda, 1944)
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultAnother fact 
defaultauthor wishes to draw 
defaultattention 
defaultto 
defaultis that the objector’s do not take into account the fact
default that
default some of the technologica
defaultlly
default innovative 
default(Apple
default products) 
defaultproducts are a result of influence of Zen Buddhism
default way of meditation
default. This is 
defaultreported in the Schumpeter column of the 
defaultEconomist (
defaultSchumpeter, 2013). 
defaultScott Adams noted in 1996 that executives had Buddha laid in their top drawers. 
default Author is aware that resea
defaultrchers in the safety risk domain do undertake mediation activities to focus their attention on hazards and measures and try avoiding mind being distracted by other specious arguments. Makers of atom bomb also relied upon meditation much to the dislike of t
defaulthe author’s 
defaultsentiments (
defaultYouTube, 2009). 
defaultIn other words, utilitarian approach to managing people under the maxim of happiness of 
defaultmany numbers
default of people 
defaultby organisation’s bosses
default 
defaultmay ignore 
defaultor deny 
defaultthe pain inflicted 
defaulton other members of the society
default by the mem
defaultbers of their organisations
default in the pursuit of happiness
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultNow, a
defaultuthor 
defaultwishes to 
defaultshows the difference between human and machine learning.
default 
defaultNobel Laureate Daniel 
defaultKahneman
default 
defaultnotes that expertise in chess playing is a skill h
defaultoned over many thousands of hours pra
defaultctice (
defaultpp
default 239)
default (Kahneman, 2011)
default. 
default 
defaultIn terms of the logic of chess game at the expert level, author asserts that a human chess player playing white and allowed one or two human errors can always win against an algorithm playing chess. Author reckons that com
defaultputer companies like 
defaultIBM etc will not object to 
defaultan unfair chess game
default being played
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultApart from the failures of memory, 
defaultperception, and cognition of danger, 
defaultresearch on human errors
default and decision making 
defaultneeds to 
defaulttake account of Consciousness. 
defaultThe scientific
default 
defaultapproach to investigate
default human
default consciousness has
default not made much progress
default over last two hundred years
default. 
defaultNobel laureates like Francis Crick have failed to establish that consciousness is local and 
defaultparticular
default to any region of the brain
default. 
defaultAuthor has noted that 
defaultFr
defaultancis Crick and 
defaultChristof
default Koch explained an amazing case of a lady patient 
defaultwhose brain is damaged by carbon oxide poisoning but is able to 
defaultcatch ball and 
defaultis unable to see form. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAn attempt to explain the workings of human brain (emergent properties like pain, pleasure, visual awareness, and seeing qualities in 
defaultobject)
default in terms of its component parts together is labelled by author as 
defaulta
default reductionist hypothesis
default (
defaultKock
default, 1998)
default.  Experim
defaultents in the neurological field have failed to yield any satisfactory results
default for scientific demonstration that consciousness is local and particulate. The experiment in 2009 has demonstrated the hypothesis that 
defaultsystem approach to consciousness is not tenab
defaultle. 
defaultNeuronal synchronization in the gamma
default 
defaultband is considered important for the transient functional
default 
defaultintegration of neural assemblies across brain areas to achieve
default 
defaultvarious cognitive functions
default. T
defaulthe
default degree to which increases in
default 
defaultevent-related synchronization (
defaultERS) in the gamma band were
default 
defaultassociated with awareness of a stimulus (its 
defaultdetectability
default) and/or
default 
defaultthe emotional content of the stimulus
default were studied. 
defaultExperimenters
default observed increases in
default 
defaultgamma band ERS within prefrontal--anterior 
defaultcingulate
default, visual,
default 
defaultparietal, 
defaultposterior 
defaultcingulate
default, and superior temporal cortices to
default 
defaultstimuli available to conscious awareness. However, we also
default 
defaultobserved increases in gamma band ERS within the 
defaultamygdala
default,
default 
defaultvisual, prefrontal, parietal, and posterior 
defaultcingulate
default cortices to
default 
defaultemotional relative
default to neutral stimuli, irrespective of their availability
default 
defaultto conscious access. This suggests that increased gamma band ERS is related to, but not sufficient for, consciousness
default (Qian Luo1, 2009)
default. 
default 
defaultThe ERS argument by neuroscience experts is analogous to elect
defaultrical engineers argument that several generators can run parallel connected to the grid and share the burden as long as the load conditions, frequency and other factors like speed etc are stable.  However, a load surge or any other disturbing condition imp
defaultosed on the set of generators can de-stabilise the performance of the set of generating machines. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSearch for 
defaultreligious
default and spiritual 
defaultexp
defaultlanations of
default consciousness and/or human awareness  is approximately 
default5,000 year old enterprise 
defaultcan be learnt from these
default modern translations of ancient 
defaultSacred 
defaulttexts
default(
defaultNikhilananda
default, 1944)
default, (Valerie, 2003)
default.
default Thus, author accepts that 
defaultC
defaultonsciousness
default is 
defaultuniversal and singular in nature. 
defaultThis is in accordance with the teaching of the Upanishads All is Brahman
default (Nikhilananda, 1944)
default,
default (Valerie, 2003), (Vyasa, 2005)
default. 
defaultTherefore, author does not subscribe to the view that 
defaultmembers of public participating in experiments are any more irrational 
defaultthen
default their counter parts in the psychological laboratory.  
defaultInterest in human factors issues and si
defaulttuational awareness has a long history can be seen from reading of these Sacred texts.  
default&#xa0;
defaultNobel Laureate Bertrand Russell noted t
defaulthere is a peculiarly painful chamber inhabited solely by philosophers
defaultwho have refuted Hume. These philosophers, though in Hell
default, have not
default 
defaultlearned wisdom. They continue to be governed by their animal propensity
default 
defaulttowards induction. But every time that they have made an induction, the next
default 
defaultinstance falsifies it. This, however, happens only during the first hundred
default 
defaultyears of their damna
defaulttion. After that, they learn to expect that an induction
defaultwill be falsified, and therefore it is not falsified until another century of
default 
defaultlogical torment has altered their expectation. Throughout all eternity surprise
default 
defaultcontinues, but each time at a higher logi
defaultcal level
default (Russell, 1945)
default.
default A Penguin editor noted on the back cover that David Hume viewed human beings not as religious creation, nor as a machine, but as a creature dominated by sentiment, passion and appetite
default (Hume, 1739/1984)
default.  
defaultDavid Hume argued that i
defaultf we exclude the sensible qualities of colour, sound, taste and smell, there is nothing 
defaultin the Universe, which has such an existence(pp280)
default (Hume, 1739/1984)
default. 
defaultDavid Hume examining the debate between theologians and moral philosophers on the theme of 
defaultimmate
defaultriality of soul noted that the fundamental principle of the atheism of Spinoza is the doctrine of the simplicity of the universe, and the unity of substance, in which Spinoza supposes both thought and matter to inhere. Spinoza, as understood by David Hume,
default noted that substance is perfectly simple and indivisible, exists everywhere, without any local presence. 
default 
defaultAuthor notes
default that d
defaultespite being called atheist,
default 
defaultSpinoza 
defaultdid believe 
defaultthat universe has a resting place in God.  
default&#xa0;
defaultAlfred 
defaultNorth
default Whitehead
default 
default(pp155-156
default)
default, 
defaultwho tutored Bertrand 
defaultRussell,
default noted that the second half of the modern philosophical thought
default from Descartes to Kant 
defaulthas been hampered by 
defaultone, or other 
defaultof the following 
defaultthree misconceptions:
defaulta)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe substance
default-
defaultquality doctrine of actuality 
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe sensationalist 
defaultdoctrine of perception
defaultc)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Kantian doctrine of the objective world as a construct from subjective experience 
default&#xa0;
defaultAlfred North Whitehead, adopting the perspective of mathematical theory of sets, argued that no occasion can be both in the past and future of 
defaulta 
defaultduration
default. A duration is a complete set of actual occasions, such that all members of the set are mutually contemporary one with another
default (Whitehead, 1927/1978)
default.  This insight applies to the hazardous events in which the states of the world are altered due t
defaulto loss lives at level crossings. 
defaultThe duration of suc
defaulth an occasion may last for centuries as evidenced from reading of the history of level crossings
default (Hall.S &amp; Mark, 2008)
default. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK Parliament Note 156 dated June 2001 looked at human factors which are liab
defaultle to cause such errors, examines
defaulthow their effects can be minimised and analysed the implications for health and safety policy
default.  Readers of this note may falsely assume that investment into human factors in the GB railway 
defaultduring the last thirteen years 
defaultm
defaultay have led to safety risk reduction in the GB railway industry. The continuous stream of level crossing and track worker accidents draw our attention to the fact the operating and maintenance 
defaultrules
default, and signalling
default 
defaultprocedures still
default suffer from latent human
default factors issues. Moreover, the UK Parliament Note 156 did not look at the human errors that may occur in the method of risk and accident analysis deployed by the GB railway industry. 
default&#xa0;
defaultResearch conducted in 1974 by William Johnson and his team found that v
defaultarious acts of omission and commission in industrial organisations 
defaultcan 
defaultlead to accidents. They developed a logical tree representation called Management Oversight and Risk Tree to perform what is known as post-mortem analysis of accident to learn what went
default wrong and inform 
defaultdecision making based upon the MORT representation
default (Kingston, et al., 2004)
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultResearch conducted in 1989 by Deborah J. Mitchell, of the Wharton School; Jay Russo, of Cornell; and Nancy Pennington, of the University of Colorado, found tha
defaultt prospective hindsight—imagining that an event has already occurred—increases the ability to correctly identify reasons for future outcomes by 30%. We have used prospective hindsight to devise a method called a
default&#xa0;
defaultpremortem
default, which helps project teams identif
defaulty risks at the outset
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultAn unpublished paper by author 
defaultwhilst working at RSSB 
defaultexplored the risks of a bus-train collision and e
defaultstablished the fact an user operating under
default knowledge based behaviour 
default(using
default the 
defaultterm as it is used in the Human Factors’ Framew
defaultork 
defaultSkill-Rules-Knowledge Framework
default) will certainly lead
default to a 
defaultfata
default bus and train collision due to the lack of effective measures to prevent such an occurrence
default (Appicharla, 2009)
default. 
defaultInformation processing at knowledge based level is slow and takes effort and 
defaultis prone to error. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAfter discussions on briefly on the cognitive illusions that may occur, it is pertinent to divert attention to the measurement of risk. 
defaultMeasurement of risk is
default an ongoing concern of academics and members of public as well
default. 
defaultFrom the representations used in the standard decision theory perspective,
default author represents the hazardous event as
default the decision node and the outcomes
default as the 
defaultresult of chance nodes
default. Because 
defaulta decision maker(s) made a decision to install level crossings on the railway infrastructure it is appropriate to treat the hazardous events as a decisional event in the following discussion on measurement of risk and error in human performance. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Tele
defaultgraph article published in 2010 contained the following figures for the year 2009
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe above data from the perspective of 
defaultquantitative risk analysis
default (i.e. event tree analysis as noted by James Reason) represents
default 
defaultthe distribution of 
defaultvarious 
defaultoutcomes of an initiating event
default (Reason, 1990)
default. 
defaultThis is not 
defaulta
default standard form of representation used in the decision theory
default as argued in 197
default9 
defaultpaper (see
default Foot-note 6).  
default&#xa0;
defaultNow, author wishes to calculate the probabilities of total number of hazardous events in 2009 at the level crossings and estimate how many were caused by the level crossing user and how many were caused by the action or inacti
defaulton of the GB railway industry. 
default&#xa0;
defaultDrawing from the data used in the above publication and the formulas shown in the Figure 1, the following information items become available.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAuthor 
defaultuses the decision rule
default 
defaultthe success and failure 
defaultof hazardous
default events adds up to 1
default. 
defaultFurther, the total space of probabilities is partitioned 
defaultinto two 
defaultzones:
default hazardous and non-hazardous occasions.
default The count of hazardous events managed by the road user u
defaultnsuccessfully is
default 14
default. These outcomes resulted

defaultHazardous events managed by the road user successfully are counted as 145. The total number of hazardous events is equal to 14+145= 159.  This includes false negatives, and true negatives outcome

defaultin dealing with the hazardous event(s). Applying the same ratio to the 
defaultnon –hazardous events, the count of non-hazardous outcomes calculated are 36,842 event
defaults.  In other words, the total count of non- hazardous events successfully managed is 36,842 -3,244 = 33,598(true positive outcomes). 
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultThe total of events occurred in 2009 are = 36842+159= 37,000 events. 
defaultThus, from Bayesian perspective, the road user unr
defaulteliability is calculated as = True negatives/ True negatives + false positives = 14/14+3244 = 4.29%.

defaultis
default approximately 96% safe and 4% unsafe. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe level crossing user reliability in managing unsafe situations is approximately 91% for the year 2009. This risk analysis figure indicates that the GB Rail Industry’s statement in 2009 
defaultor 2013 
defaultthat level crossing user is responsible 
defaultor cause 
defaultfor 92% of 
defaultlevel crossings 
defaultaccident is an erroneous statement. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe above results indicate that the GB Railway 
defaultfocal point of 
defaultattention on risk analysis and human factors using fault and event tree analysis ( Bow Tie Model) as a quantitative risk estimation tool and using specialists for the analysis of human error occurring in the front line activity is not fetching any improvem
defaultents in the level of 
defaultrisk. 
defaultThe above calculation shows that the assertion of GB Railway executive and staff that level crossing users are causing 90% of the accidents is an illusion entertained by GB Railway executives and staff from a cultural and social 
defaultperspective.  
defaultThe method of using event tree analysis suffers from human error problem can be seen from the 
defaultexamination of 
defaultFigures I and II of the 1979 paper on Prospect Theory
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAuthor is of
default the firm opinion that the sequential formulation of hazard eve
defaultnt scenarios leads to errors in subjective assessment as the Bow Tie model does not represent the standard form of decision analysis. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAll of the 
defaultsafety 
defaultengineering work 
defaultcurrently popular with engineering work force evolved from 
defaultsince the start of Boeing 
defaultmissile safety programs uses this form of Bow Tie Modelling and analysis 
default(Clifton, 2005)
default. Several authors like James Reason, Nancy 
defaultLeveson
default and Sir Charles Haddon Cave  apart from author have critiqued this method
default (Reason, 1990)
default,
default (Haddon-Cave, 2009)
default,
default (Leves
defaulton, 2011).  Sequential procesing of information may  lead to errors is not a new idea. Arthur Schopenhaur was the first 
defaultperson 
defaultto moot this idea
default when he remarked that both
default David Hume and Imma
defaultn
defaultuel Kant made same type of errors in thei
defaultr reasoning of cause-ef
defaultfect rela
defaulttions. Dav
defaultid Hume reasoned that consequnce is a mere sequence
default 
defaultwhereas Kant affirms that all sequence must necessarily be  consequnce
default(Schopenhauer, 1818)
default. 
defaultOppostion advanced by John Stuart Mill in 1861 against 
defaultthe contemperaory practice of then British Civl Service in the form adminstering the rules and regulations is seen by some as the early poineering activity of management (David Clutterbuck, 1990). 
defaultThe 
default19
defaultth
default century prescriptive approach  to rules and regulations 
defaultpersist
defaults
default in the ORR’s regulating practice
default of managing design of level crossings can be inferrred from reading their Guidance on Level Crossings (The Office of Rail Regulator , 2011), (The Office 
defaultof Rail Regulator, 2008)
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs far as the rational agent model of economic theory
default is concerned
default, it is important to note that contracts between the clients like railway undertakings and infrastructure managers 
defaultand their suppliers 
defaultrely upon the risk managers
default and Bow Tie models to inform their decisions on 
defaulthazards
default. These decisions on whether to 
defaultclose out the hazards on their hazard log or do nothing about them as the cost of eliminating the hazards is beyond the specific firm or the railway operator
default and theref
defaultore, the real issue of danger at level crossings remain unaddressed
default. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe nature of remedial measures to eliminate the existing
default man-made
default hazards 
defaultfaced world-wide
default 
defaultis that the implementation is carried out by the duty –holders but the cost has to be borne 
defaultby respective nations.  
defaultDeaths at level crossings may be less in absolute terms when compared to deaths due to other diseases as pointed out by Daniel 
defaultKahneman
default in chapter 13 of his book
default (Kahneman, 2011)
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultGovernment intervention is needed 
defaultas Nobel Laureat
defaulte Ronald H. 
defaultCoase
default realised that life is more complex than theory. The approach to solving deaths at level crossing problem cannot be based upon market based mechanisms 
defaultas the
default transactions costs are not borne by market participants but by outsiders
default of the m
defaultarket mechanism(Exchange, 2013)
default. Settling by means of praivate out –of –court settlement with level crossings victims does not solve the problem of transactions costs borne by the external parties. This can be seen from the out-of-court settlement made by 
defaultNetwork Rail
default. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultRisk assessment is an implicit requirement of the UK Health and Safety at Work etc. Act (HSW, 1974) and is also explicitly required by other general and 
defaultindustry-specific regulations
default. The UK HSE has published research looking at the pitfalls of risk assessment in the period prior to 
defaultmandating of 
defaultthe Common Safety Method
default.
default 
defaultGood practice in managing risk at public rail-road interfaces level crossings is to b
defaultuild bridges. At the private level crossings, where
defaultver
default feasible
default,
default bridges can be built and where they cannot be 
defaultclosed,
default modern radio communications can be utilised to inform the level crossing user of the train arrival. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe implementation of standard appr
defaultoach to signalling like ERTMS/ECTS technology does not solve the problem of deaths at 
defaultpublic rail –road interface managed by 
defaultlevel crossings. By wrongly associating the problem of death at level crossings with the theory of market capitalism, Economists ar
defaulte distracting attention from the remedial measures that need to be taken. However, availability of barriers may be recorded in the hazard log at the time of safety justification of the start or close out of the railway projects
default, granted by RSSB and
default inspect
defaulted by the regulator
default. This phenomenon of risk assessment in the ERTMS project did
default figure in the RAIB
default Report on Cambrian ERTMS ABCL Incident
default (
default RAIB, 2012)
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultNow, let us consider the data from the UK Law Commission Paper
default 
defaultavailable for computing 
defaulte
defaultconomics of deaths at level crossings (a rail-road interface). 
default&#xa0;
defaultCost to the 
defaultGB 
defaulteconomy due to loss of 
default11 FWIs (
defaultpara
default 28) statistical lives on an annual basis at the value of £1.5 million per statistical life, A= £16.5 million. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCost to the GB economy (
defaultpara
default 18, 19, 20) due to investment on safety measures on eliminating level crossing, 
defaultD
default is calculated as under
default in the Table 1 on the next page.
default The assumption
defaults are that the 
defaultissues of typography and heritage do not arise.
default Author has n
defaultot computed any benefits to the wider economy. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe facts of railways accidents from 1851till date studied by author suggest that these accident scenarios are not available to signalling engineers and managers memory when demanded.  The social DNA of a ra
defaultilway engineer(s) and manager(s) cannot associate hazards and barriers as outlined in the author’s publications suggest that the idea that much vaunted learning skills are absent from the railway sector. 
defaultA PhD in computer science and a signalling system en
defaultgineering domain expert with over 20 years’ experience in 2001 was surprised when author had suggested random number  generating algorithms were not random  at all. Probably, he did not read publication by 
defaultI.Mitrani
default where 
defaultMitrani
default accepted the argument
default (I.M
defaultitrani, 1982)
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultAuthor wishes to place on record that Mr Anson Jack and Mr David 
defaultBulgin
default of RSSB did comprehend the system advanced by the author when he deployed the system at RSSB. Apart from them author did not find any other person competent to grasp th
defaulte subtleties of risk assessment using cognitive systems engineering during his employment period with RSSB.

defaultAssuming the disproportion factor in the calculations for loss of statistical life to be 10, then annual loss of statistical life per year = 11*1.5*10= £ 165, 000, 000. 
defaultAuthor assumes that

default higher 
defaultdis
default-proportionate
default figure was 
defaultused for recommending the in
defaultstallation of the TPWS System in 2003.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe ratio of cost of safety measures to the cost of loss lives works out to approximately 50. In other words, 
defaultit takes 50 years to recover the cost of investment into safety improvements at the rail road interface.
default 
defaultAuthor has not considered routes for financing such as debt financing as this theme is beyond author’s skill base. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWork done by James Reason in 1990 has shown that Group-think bias is a major problem that poses threat to the safety of members of public 
defaultand staff and confirmed by author again in 2010
default (Appicharla, 2010)
default. 
default 
defaultGiven the fact that 
defaultpsychology of railway signalling engineers and managers is
default biased towards measurements 
defaultof lengths in terms of braking distance (service and emergency) 
defaultand 
defaultpsychology o
defaultf human factors and risk managers using 
defaultmeans and variance frameworks applied to risk data 
defaultand human factors data biases them to accept the Cartesian idea that there is no empty space without objects filling it. Nobel Laureate Albert Einstein how our psych
defaultological concepts of space and time arise in practice (pp.136-137). Author note
defaults
default Albert Einstein’s idea that our auditory experience of hearing 
defaulta 
defaultcar passing
default by on adjacent 
defaultroad may
default precede our experien
defaultce of it 
defaultappearing visually
default from where we are seated
default.
default In other words, time 
defaultsequence of events cannot be ordered in accordance with 
defaulttime sequence of experiences (pp140)
default (Einstein, 1920)
default. This has implications for modelling hazardous event sequences in the activity of eliciting or describing potential or actua
defaultl accident scenarios. 
default&#xa0;
defaultApart from the accident and other case studies p
defaultublished since 2006, author 
defaultexperienced managerial incompetence in risk assessment in 
defaultIndian organisational 
defaultsettings as well. Author recalls his experience 
defaultduring his previous employm
defaultent with CEGELEC India between 1994 till 1998, a 
defaultbusiness unit of French Alcatel
default. A
defaultuthor 
defaultfound that the executive and managerial staff employed with CEGELEC India did not possess
default sufficient competence on 
defaulthow to perform risk assessment as required by the 
defaultAl
defaultcatel C
defaultorporate Guidelines. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the processes deployed within the business acquisition procedure required 
defaultthe bid manager to prepare the estimate of chances to win the bid in a risk assessment
default form
default prior to the bid submission. However, author, as a bid m
defaultanager, found that the Chief Executive of CEGELEC India made errors in filing the risk assessment form for a  bid  £ 5.8 million at 1997 prices. 
defaultThe bid was won but the project did not materialise. 
defaultSimilarly, another 
defaultrisk assessment form with for a 
defaultbid wit
defaulth a value of £58 million was also similarly filled with errors to boost the chances of CEO’s tenure
default in the event of winning the bid
default.  The rupee to pound exchange ratio was 70 
defaultat the time bidding 
defaultin 1998. 
defaultAuthor had brought these facts to the attention of M
defaultr Allan Davies, the Technical Director at 
defaultAlstom
default in 1999 vide a private communication
default (Appicharla, April 1999)
default.  
defaultAuthor learnt subsequently that the bid was lost to a competitor with whom the author had formulated a bid strategy. 
defaultThe 
defaultCEGELEC India 
defaultbusiness
default unit and 
defaultits parent company were subsequently absorbed into 
defaultAlstom
default India Transmission and Distribution. Author has learnt a lesson from this episode that organis
defaultational structures and procedures
default do not provide safe guard against 
defaultsystematic 
defaulthuman errors. 
default&#xa0;
defaultN
defaultobel Laureate, Daniel 
defaultKahneman
default expressed confidence 
defaultthat organisations 
defaultare better when it comes to avoiding errors, because they naturally think more slowly and have the power to impose orderly procedures. Daniel 
defaultKahneman
default hoped organisations can introduc
defaulte 
defaultsolutions like 
defaultchecklists, reference class forecasting and the 
defaultpremortem
default.  Moreover, people can watch another as they approach mine fields (
defaultpp
default417-418)
default (Kahneman, 2011)
default. 
defaultAuthor argues that the hypothesis
default of free market ca
defaultpitalism can be argued for counter
default-acting 
defaultagainst human errors
default. This is a fallacy commonly entertained is shown by the 
defaulterrors in safety research in author’s Written Evidence o
defaultn 11the November 2013
default. Author’s technical review of the Common Safety Method of Regulation found that it is full of
default latent human errors
default (Appicharla, 2013)
default. 
default 
defaultThus, author cannot assent to the confidence expressed by
default 
defaultDaniel 
defaultKahneman
default 
defaultthat organisations are less prone to commit errors. B
defaulteca
defaultuse 
defaultauthors has shown that 
defaultjudgements on risk decisions can be distorted by
default payoffs and penalties
default, or facing saving gestures within
default 
defaultindustry or an organisation.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultAuthor cannot foresee how manslaughter 
defaultlegislation as suggested by the UK Law Commission 
defaultcan be applied to the cases where classes of regulatory, managerial, engineerin

defaultto 
defaultmembers of

defaultthree billion 
defaultpounds 
defaultinto new signalling technologies
default may not yield benefits 
defaultdesired 
defaultif the foregoing discussions
default are taken 
defaultinto account. Therefore, author suggests the idea to the Members of Transport Select Committee that a learning unit dedicated to the identification and assessment of railway hazards and their elimination is vitally necessary as the review of existing level

defaultrisk judgements are prone to error
default.

defaulttherefore,
