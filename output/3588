[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Additional Written Evidence is a submission by the author in his personal capacity. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The aim of the paper is t
[normal]hree
[normal]-
[normal]fold. First to present
[normal] 
[normal]Network Rail data on level crossings 
[normal]as 
[normal]reported by Laura Roberts and published by the Daily Telegraph on 18 August 2010
[normal]. Then, 
[normal]examine the 
[normal]published 
[normal]data using
[normal] the Bayesian method of statistics
[normal] to establish the reliability of level crossing user
[normal] actions
[normal] 
[normal]and reliability of
[normal] GB Railways’ inferences
[normal]. 
[normal]Utility of this approach is to examine whether the latest evidence of RSSB/Network Rail claim that railway accidents are a result of user’s action accords with historical observations or not?  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Following the 
[normal]Wri
[normal]tten and 
[normal]Oral Evidences 
[normal]presented 
[normal]before the Transport Select Committee, a
[normal]uthor is anxious that c
[normal]hange of leadership at Network Rail and additional
[normal] funding by ORR 
[normal]may be used 
[normal]by GB Railway Industry 
[normal]to close out 
[normal]dis
[normal]-used level crossings to satisfy anxiety o
[normal]f members of public and 
[normal]media to 
[normal]meet
[normal] the regulatory targets without changing the underlying process of risk based decision making
[normal] or 
[normal]make
[normal] a 
[normal]long –term 
[normal]plan to eliminate 
[normal]the dangerous assets
[normal] of level crossings
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Psychology of good decision making require
[normal]s that decision maker reflect upon the data when new or same evidence is presented again to work out whether a change of one’s own knowledge base is required or not?
[normal] In this light, author examines the risk data publicly available. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Second 
[normal]is 
[normal]to draw the a
[normal]ttention of the Members of Transport Selection Committee
[normal] to
[normal] 
[normal]the distractions 
[normal]introduce
[normal]d
[normal] into GB railway industrial decision making on hazards posed by level 
[normal]crossings by the prevalent ideas of different schools of 
[normal]Industrial finan
[normal]ce and economy
[normal]. Utility of
[normal] this ap
[normal]proach is to illuminate 
[normal]approach
[normal]es
[normal] applied to measuring and forecasting risk and examine whether industrial decision making in the GB railways aligns with the best practice of risk management. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Third 
[normal]is 
[normal]to draw 
[normal]attention of the Members of Transpor
[normal]t Selection Committee 
[normal]to 
[normal]the fact 
[normal]of 
[normal]the risk analysis as it is performed
[normal]. Failure of risk analysis 
[normal]is itself is 
[normal]a
[normal] formal cause contributing
[normal] to the level crossing accidents. 
[normal]This
[normal] reasoning from Aristotelian causation perspective is 
[normal]a
[normal] valid idea accepted by
[normal] 
[normal]psychological (human factor)
[normal] experts
[normal] (Rasmussen, et al., 1994)
[normal].  
[normal]Risk management can be itself a common mode of failure is learnt from Douglas W. Hubbard’s publication: Failure of Risk Management
[normal] (Hubbard, 2009)
[normal].  
[normal]Failure of railway organisations to 
[normal]understand safety risk of level crossings was studied by Barry A. Turner in 1976
[normal] (Turner, 1976)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Previous submissions

[normal], and
[normal] how
[normal] pre-mortem risk analysis of 
[normal]a
[normal] level-crossing accident
[normal] 
[normal]of train-bus  collision 
[normal]can be carried out

[normal]This paper presents
[normal] the results of examination of Network Rail published 
[normal]risk 
[normal]data on level crossings using Bayesian method of statistics as per the System for Railway Investigations Methodology (SIRI). 
[normal]This section discusses the role of human factor issu
[normal]es on performance when 
[normal]a
[normal] human user interacts with level crossings. 
[normal]The discussions over societal risk by John Adams may be consulted here
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Author presented the application of the Bayesian method of statistics (i.e. rules of conditional probabilities) to
[normal] determine the quantitative reliability of train driver (human performance) in 
[normal]dangerous situations in 
[normal]the form of a poster session at the IET System Safety Conference in 2010. Author had used 
[normal]simplified
[normal] 
[normal]Bayesian method of statistics
[normal] in his submission to t
[normal]he UK Law Commission Inquiry on Level Crossings(Appicharla, 2010). Author noted that Bayesian
[normal] method can be
[normal] applied where errors in statistical risk analysis are to be identified as suggested by Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman
[normal]. This is
[normal] to overcome the biase
[normal]s inherent in
[normal] risk perceptions by public and experts as well. 
[normal]Author 
[normal]explained 
[normal]this in a general way 
[normal]in the Technical Review of the Common Safety Method presented at the IET System Safety Conference in October 2013
[normal] 
[normal]and in the Submission to the UK Law Commi
[normal]ssion in 2010 (Appicharla, 2010),
[normal](Appicharla, 2013)
[normal]. 
[normal] Complicated forms of Bayesian analysis were performed by expert statisticians to argue the case 
[normal]for 
[normal]the temperature effect of ring failures and the probability risk assessment of Space Shuttle Challenge
[normal]r launch decision
[normal] (Dalal, et al., 1989)
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Scott Adams, creator of Dilbert, writes that engineers hate risk
[normal] (Adams, 1996)
[normal]. Scott Adams reasons that engineers try to eliminate risk it whenever they can because media will amplify a single engineering mistake
[normal]. Some of the examples of engineering mistakes given by Scott Adams are 
[normal]Hidenberg
[normal], Space Shuttle
[normal] Challenger
[normal], Hubble space telescope, Apollo 13, Titanic, Ford Pinto, and 
[normal]Corvair
[normal]. 
[normal]The fear of killing thousands motivates engineers to eliminate risk, writes Scott Adams. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]An objection may be raised by railway executives and staff that this is a very complicated way of looking at risk
[normal] for the fear of media 
[normal]when deaths at level crossing
[normal]s are never more than double figures
[normal]. In general, 
[normal]they argue that 
[normal]organisations and their leaders are always short of time, money and resources and do not have 
[normal]enough 
[normal]resources to indulge in such wishful thinking. 
[normal]A j
[normal]udicial test of 
[normal]evaluating 
[normal]cost-benefit
[normal] analysis 
[normal]of eliminating risk 
[normal]provides 
[normal]us with 
[normal]a satisfactory and legal ground for arriving at a decision on how much investment is to be made into safety improvements. 
[normal]Opposition from employees is also a factor in decision making 
[normal]process 
[normal]and therefore, 
[normal]a 
[normal]cognitive appr
[normal]oach to errors is a distraction. The
[normal] attention of the executives 
[normal]is a expensive resource and shall be depl
[normal]oyed where
[normal] 
[normal]far more serious decisions are to be made. 
[normal]This objection is a valid one and reader can find this type of argument in the bri
[normal]ef survey of literature on managerial decision making
[normal] by Janis&amp; Mann
[normal]. T
[normal]his strategy 
[normal]can be labelled as a quasi-
[normal]satisficing
[normal] approach or 
[normal]satisficing
[normal] approach to decision 
[normal]making (
[normal]L.Janis
[normal] &amp; Mann, 1977). 
[normal]Howeve
[normal]r, this argument does not stand up
[normal] to the legal scr
[normal]utiny as it was examined and concluded 
[normal]by the UK Law Commission 
[normal]in September 2013
[normal] that law on level crossings needs to be reformed to facilitate faster closure
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Here is the response of the Office of Rail Regulation to 
[normal]the UK Law Commissions proposal
[normal]. 
[normal]Ian
[normal] Prosser, Director of Railway Safety at the Office of Rail Regulation, said: “The Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) welcomes the Law Commissions’ proposals to modernise level crossing legislation, which will cut red-tape and make it easier for high-risk cros
[normal]sings to be closed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Great Britain’s level crossings, although among the safest in Europe, pose a significant rail safety risk to the public.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] That is why we have announced millions of pounds’ worth of extra funds to close or upgrade level crossings over t
[normal]he next five years, and will work to support implementation of improved level crossing laws.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the previous Written Evidence dated 11
[normal]th
[normal] November 2013, author has shown how the signalling engineering experts believed that 
[normal]Great Britain’s
[normal] level crossings 
[normal]are
[normal] the safest in Europe
[normal] and therefore, no action is needed. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]By reflecting upon the statement of the ORR’s Director of Railway Safety, author wonders whether level crossings can be categorised by risk into t
[normal]wo different categories of high
[normal] and 
[normal]low risk
[normal] le
[normal]vel crossings.  The question arises as to how to detect errors in risk 
[normal]categorisation 
[normal]by industrial organisations 
[normal]by comparing it to the data 
[normal]publicly available in a cost efficient manner? This paper gives an answer in relation to the UK railway level cros
[normal]sings. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Further, a
[normal]uthor wishes to counter this logic by drawing the objector’s attention to the fact that psychology of thinking and reasoning is an active research subject since the time of Aristotle
[normal] in a recorded form
[normal]. Aristotle argued that human beings are rational animals. This paper published by Philip N. Johnson-Laird argues that errors depend upon the mental 
[normal]model that is
[normal] used in reasoning in 2010
[normal]. Philip N. Johnson-Laird argues against computational approaches t
[normal]o problem solving. Therefore, reasoning is helpful guide to draw out errors in reasoning. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Author wishes to add that unlike errors in economic 
[normal]or statistical 
[normal]reasoning, the loss of life is 
[normal]irreversible
[normal] event
[normal] 
[normal]like an incurable disease that
[normal] 
[normal]has 
[normal]no drug
[normal] that
[normal] can cure
[normal] it
[normal]. 
[normal]From a profit perspective, one can postpone development of drugs if the development is un-profitable. Author does not think that this is a sound policy. 
[normal]Further, 
[normal]settling the debate from a stochastic analytical view point lies in ascertaining
[normal] the type of distribution involved, 
[normal]determine 
[normal]the spread of parameters etc and involves performing social analysis or analysis of computer stimul
[normal]ations
[normal] (Dalal, et al., 1989)
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Author had showed how 
[normal]Aristotle model of three causal factors (causational 
[normal]model
[normal]) model
[normal] can explain
[normal] the adverse system event coming
[normal] into be
[normal]ing. The Clapham Accident case study wa
[normal]s published to show the logic involved in the
[normal] explanation
[normal] 
[normal]of the accident
[normal](Appicharla, 2010)
[normal]. Author
[normal] accepts the fact three causal factors model cannot ex
[normal]plain the making of the Universe
[normal] and this has been clarified in the NASA Challenger Case Study published by the author (
[normal]Appicharla
[normal], 2012). 
[normal]Executive decision making i
[normal]n risk assessment process used by firms is in
[normal] itself a third factor apart from the materia
[normal]l and efficient factors involved in the
[normal] physical
[normal] causation of accidents. 
[normal]Nobel Laureate Daniel 
[normal]Kahneman
[normal] cautions
[normal] the readers
[normal] against 
[normal]usage of causal intuitions when statistical thinking may be appropriate (pp77)
[normal] (Kahneman, 2011)
[normal]. These difficulties 
[normal]introdu
[normal]ced by universal religious beliefs 
[normal]as pointed by 
[normal]Paul Bloom and described by 
[normal]Nobel Laureate, Daniel 
[normal]Kahneman
[normal] over physical causes, intentional and other causes do not manifest in the case of author’s 
[normal]explanation of
[normal] the Herefordshire Level Crossing accident
[normal].  
[normal]It is important to note Nobel Laureate Herbert 
[normal]A.Simon’s
[normal] idea that co-relation is not causation
[normal] (Simon, 1972)
[normal]. The philosophy of action and inaction is extremely subtle is noted by Swami 
[normal]Nikhilananda
[normal] on his commentary on the verses of 4.16, 4.17, 4.18, 
[normal]and 4.19 of the ancient sacred text of Hindus, the 
[normal]Bhagavad
[normal] 
[normal]Gita
[normal] (Nikhilananda, 1944)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Another fact 
[normal]author wishes to draw 
[normal]attention 
[normal]to 
[normal]is that the objector’s do not take into account the fact
[normal] that
[normal] some of the technologica
[normal]lly
[normal] innovative 
[normal](Apple
[normal] products) 
[normal]products are a result of influence of Zen Buddhism
[normal] way of meditation
[normal]. This is 
[normal]reported in the Schumpeter column of the 
[normal]Economist (
[normal]Schumpeter, 2013). 
[normal]Scott Adams noted in 1996 that executives had Buddha laid in their top drawers. 
[normal] Author is aware that resea
[normal]rchers in the safety risk domain do undertake mediation activities to focus their attention on hazards and measures and try avoiding mind being distracted by other specious arguments. Makers of atom bomb also relied upon meditation much to the dislike of t
[normal]he author’s 
[normal]sentiments (
[normal]YouTube, 2009). 
[normal]In other words, utilitarian approach to managing people under the maxim of happiness of 
[normal]many numbers
[normal] of people 
[normal]by organisation’s bosses
[normal] 
[normal]may ignore 
[normal]or deny 
[normal]the pain inflicted 
[normal]on other members of the society
[normal] by the mem
[normal]bers of their organisations
[normal] in the pursuit of happiness
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Now, a
[normal]uthor 
[normal]wishes to 
[normal]shows the difference between human and machine learning.
[normal] 
[normal]Nobel Laureate Daniel 
[normal]Kahneman
[normal] 
[normal]notes that expertise in chess playing is a skill h
[normal]oned over many thousands of hours pra
[normal]ctice (
[normal]pp
[normal] 239)
[normal] (Kahneman, 2011)
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]In terms of the logic of chess game at the expert level, author asserts that a human chess player playing white and allowed one or two human errors can always win against an algorithm playing chess. Author reckons that com
[normal]puter companies like 
[normal]IBM etc will not object to 
[normal]an unfair chess game
[normal] being played
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Apart from the failures of memory, 
[normal]perception, and cognition of danger, 
[normal]research on human errors
[normal] and decision making 
[normal]needs to 
[normal]take account of Consciousness. 
[normal]The scientific
[normal] 
[normal]approach to investigate
[normal] human
[normal] consciousness has
[normal] not made much progress
[normal] over last two hundred years
[normal]. 
[normal]Nobel laureates like Francis Crick have failed to establish that consciousness is local and 
[normal]particular
[normal] to any region of the brain
[normal]. 
[normal]Author has noted that 
[normal]Fr
[normal]ancis Crick and 
[normal]Christof
[normal] Koch explained an amazing case of a lady patient 
[normal]whose brain is damaged by carbon oxide poisoning but is able to 
[normal]catch ball and 
[normal]is unable to see form. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]An attempt to explain the workings of human brain (emergent properties like pain, pleasure, visual awareness, and seeing qualities in 
[normal]object)
[normal] in terms of its component parts together is labelled by author as 
[normal]a
[normal] reductionist hypothesis
[normal] (
[normal]Kock
[normal], 1998)
[normal].  Experim
[normal]ents in the neurological field have failed to yield any satisfactory results
[normal] for scientific demonstration that consciousness is local and particulate. The experiment in 2009 has demonstrated the hypothesis that 
[normal]system approach to consciousness is not tenab
[normal]le. 
[normal]Neuronal synchronization in the gamma
[normal] 
[normal]band is considered important for the transient functional
[normal] 
[normal]integration of neural assemblies across brain areas to achieve
[normal] 
[normal]various cognitive functions
[normal]. T
[normal]he
[normal] degree to which increases in
[normal] 
[normal]event-related synchronization (
[normal]ERS) in the gamma band were
[normal] 
[normal]associated with awareness of a stimulus (its 
[normal]detectability
[normal]) and/or
[normal] 
[normal]the emotional content of the stimulus
[normal] were studied. 
[normal]Experimenters
[normal] observed increases in
[normal] 
[normal]gamma band ERS within prefrontal--anterior 
[normal]cingulate
[normal], visual,
[normal] 
[normal]parietal, 
[normal]posterior 
[normal]cingulate
[normal], and superior temporal cortices to
[normal] 
[normal]stimuli available to conscious awareness. However, we also
[normal] 
[normal]observed increases in gamma band ERS within the 
[normal]amygdala
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]visual, prefrontal, parietal, and posterior 
[normal]cingulate
[normal] cortices to
[normal] 
[normal]emotional relative
[normal] to neutral stimuli, irrespective of their availability
[normal] 
[normal]to conscious access. This suggests that increased gamma band ERS is related to, but not sufficient for, consciousness
[normal] (Qian Luo1, 2009)
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]The ERS argument by neuroscience experts is analogous to elect
[normal]rical engineers argument that several generators can run parallel connected to the grid and share the burden as long as the load conditions, frequency and other factors like speed etc are stable.  However, a load surge or any other disturbing condition imp
[normal]osed on the set of generators can de-stabilise the performance of the set of generating machines. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Search for 
[normal]religious
[normal] and spiritual 
[normal]exp
[normal]lanations of
[normal] consciousness and/or human awareness  is approximately 
[normal]5,000 year old enterprise 
[normal]can be learnt from these
[normal] modern translations of ancient 
[normal]Sacred 
[normal]texts
[normal](
[normal]Nikhilananda
[normal], 1944)
[normal], (Valerie, 2003)
[normal].
[normal] Thus, author accepts that 
[normal]C
[normal]onsciousness
[normal] is 
[normal]universal and singular in nature. 
[normal]This is in accordance with the teaching of the Upanishads All is Brahman
[normal] (Nikhilananda, 1944)
[normal],
[normal] (Valerie, 2003), (Vyasa, 2005)
[normal]. 
[normal]Therefore, author does not subscribe to the view that 
[normal]members of public participating in experiments are any more irrational 
[normal]then
[normal] their counter parts in the psychological laboratory.  
[normal]Interest in human factors issues and si
[normal]tuational awareness has a long history can be seen from reading of these Sacred texts.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Nobel Laureate Bertrand Russell noted t
[normal]here is a peculiarly painful chamber inhabited solely by philosophers
[normal]who have refuted Hume. These philosophers, though in Hell
[normal], have not
[normal] 
[normal]learned wisdom. They continue to be governed by their animal propensity
[normal] 
[normal]towards induction. But every time that they have made an induction, the next
[normal] 
[normal]instance falsifies it. This, however, happens only during the first hundred
[normal] 
[normal]years of their damna
[normal]tion. After that, they learn to expect that an induction
[normal]will be falsified, and therefore it is not falsified until another century of
[normal] 
[normal]logical torment has altered their expectation. Throughout all eternity surprise
[normal] 
[normal]continues, but each time at a higher logi
[normal]cal level
[normal] (Russell, 1945)
[normal].
[normal] A Penguin editor noted on the back cover that David Hume viewed human beings not as religious creation, nor as a machine, but as a creature dominated by sentiment, passion and appetite
[normal] (Hume, 1739/1984)
[normal].  
[normal]David Hume argued that i
[normal]f we exclude the sensible qualities of colour, sound, taste and smell, there is nothing 
[normal]in the Universe, which has such an existence(pp280)
[normal] (Hume, 1739/1984)
[normal]. 
[normal]David Hume examining the debate between theologians and moral philosophers on the theme of 
[normal]immate
[normal]riality of soul noted that the fundamental principle of the atheism of Spinoza is the doctrine of the simplicity of the universe, and the unity of substance, in which Spinoza supposes both thought and matter to inhere. Spinoza, as understood by David Hume,
[normal] noted that substance is perfectly simple and indivisible, exists everywhere, without any local presence. 
[normal] 
[normal]Author notes
[normal] that d
[normal]espite being called atheist,
[normal] 
[normal]Spinoza 
[normal]did believe 
[normal]that universe has a resting place in God.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Alfred 
[normal]North
[normal] Whitehead
[normal] 
[normal](pp155-156
[normal])
[normal], 
[normal]who tutored Bertrand 
[normal]Russell,
[normal] noted that the second half of the modern philosophical thought
[normal] from Descartes to Kant 
[normal]has been hampered by 
[normal]one, or other 
[normal]of the following 
[normal]three misconceptions:
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The substance
[normal]-
[normal]quality doctrine of actuality 
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The sensationalist 
[normal]doctrine of perception
[normal]c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Kantian doctrine of the objective world as a construct from subjective experience 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Alfred North Whitehead, adopting the perspective of mathematical theory of sets, argued that no occasion can be both in the past and future of 
[normal]a 
[normal]duration
[normal]. A duration is a complete set of actual occasions, such that all members of the set are mutually contemporary one with another
[normal] (Whitehead, 1927/1978)
[normal].  This insight applies to the hazardous events in which the states of the world are altered due t
[normal]o loss lives at level crossings. 
[normal]The duration of suc
[normal]h an occasion may last for centuries as evidenced from reading of the history of level crossings
[normal] (Hall.S &amp; Mark, 2008)
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The UK Parliament Note 156 dated June 2001 looked at human factors which are liab
[normal]le to cause such errors, examines
[normal]how their effects can be minimised and analysed the implications for health and safety policy
[normal].  Readers of this note may falsely assume that investment into human factors in the GB railway 
[normal]during the last thirteen years 
[normal]m
[normal]ay have led to safety risk reduction in the GB railway industry. The continuous stream of level crossing and track worker accidents draw our attention to the fact the operating and maintenance 
[normal]rules
[normal], and signalling
[normal] 
[normal]procedures still
[normal] suffer from latent human
[normal] factors issues. Moreover, the UK Parliament Note 156 did not look at the human errors that may occur in the method of risk and accident analysis deployed by the GB railway industry. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Research conducted in 1974 by William Johnson and his team found that v
[normal]arious acts of omission and commission in industrial organisations 
[normal]can 
[normal]lead to accidents. They developed a logical tree representation called Management Oversight and Risk Tree to perform what is known as post-mortem analysis of accident to learn what went
[normal] wrong and inform 
[normal]decision making based upon the MORT representation
[normal] (Kingston, et al., 2004)
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Research conducted in 1989 by Deborah J. Mitchell, of the Wharton School; Jay Russo, of Cornell; and Nancy Pennington, of the University of Colorado, found tha
[normal]t prospective hindsight—imagining that an event has already occurred—increases the ability to correctly identify reasons for future outcomes by 30%. We have used prospective hindsight to devise a method called a
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]premortem
[normal], which helps project teams identif
[normal]y risks at the outset
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]An unpublished paper by author 
[normal]whilst working at RSSB 
[normal]explored the risks of a bus-train collision and e
[normal]stablished the fact an user operating under
[normal] knowledge based behaviour 
[normal](using
[normal] the 
[normal]term as it is used in the Human Factors’ Framew
[normal]ork 
[normal]Skill-Rules-Knowledge Framework
[normal]) will certainly lead
[normal] to a 
[normal]fata
[normal] bus and train collision due to the lack of effective measures to prevent such an occurrence
[normal] (Appicharla, 2009)
[normal]. 
[normal]Information processing at knowledge based level is slow and takes effort and 
[normal]is prone to error. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]After discussions on briefly on the cognitive illusions that may occur, it is pertinent to divert attention to the measurement of risk. 
[normal]Measurement of risk is
[normal] an ongoing concern of academics and members of public as well
[normal]. 
[normal]From the representations used in the standard decision theory perspective,
[normal] author represents the hazardous event as
[normal] the decision node and the outcomes
[normal] as the 
[normal]result of chance nodes
[normal]. Because 
[normal]a decision maker(s) made a decision to install level crossings on the railway infrastructure it is appropriate to treat the hazardous events as a decisional event in the following discussion on measurement of risk and error in human performance. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Tele
[normal]graph article published in 2010 contained the following figures for the year 2009
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The above data from the perspective of 
[normal]quantitative risk analysis
[normal] (i.e. event tree analysis as noted by James Reason) represents
[normal] 
[normal]the distribution of 
[normal]various 
[normal]outcomes of an initiating event
[normal] (Reason, 1990)
[normal]. 
[normal]This is not 
[normal]a
[normal] standard form of representation used in the decision theory
[normal] as argued in 197
[normal]9 
[normal]paper (see
[normal] Foot-note 6).  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Now, author wishes to calculate the probabilities of total number of hazardous events in 2009 at the level crossings and estimate how many were caused by the level crossing user and how many were caused by the action or inacti
[normal]on of the GB railway industry. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Drawing from the data used in the above publication and the formulas shown in the Figure 1, the following information items become available.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Author 
[normal]uses the decision rule
[normal] 
[normal]the success and failure 
[normal]of hazardous
[normal] events adds up to 1
[normal]. 
[normal]Further, the total space of probabilities is partitioned 
[normal]into two 
[normal]zones:
[normal] hazardous and non-hazardous occasions.
[normal] The count of hazardous events managed by the road user u
[normal]nsuccessfully is
[normal] 14
[normal]. These outcomes resulted
[normal] in 13 deaths. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Hazardous events managed by the road user successfully are counted as 145. The total number of hazardous events is equal to 14+145= 159.  This includes false negatives, and true negatives outcome
[normal]s.  T
[normal]he ratio of 911
[normal]95
[normal]: .08
[normal]805
[normal] is an indicator of user 
[normal]action’s reliability
[normal] 
[normal]to unreliability ratio 
[normal]in dealing with the hazardous event(s). Applying the same ratio to the 
[normal]non –hazardous events, the count of non-hazardous outcomes calculated are 36,842 event
[normal]s.  In other words, the total count of non- hazardous events successfully managed is 36,842 -3,244 = 33,598(true positive outcomes). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]The total of events occurred in 2009 are = 36842+159= 37,000 events. 
[normal]Thus, from Bayesian perspective, the road user unr
[normal]eliability is calculated as = True negatives/ True negatives + false positives = 14/14+3244 = 4.29%. 
[normal]Figure

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The ratio 
[normal]of safe to unsafe partitioning of total (interaction
[normal]s
[normal]) at the rail and road 
[normal]interfaces in 2009 from a statistical perspective 
[normal]is
[normal] approximately 96% safe and 4% unsafe. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The level crossing user reliability in managing unsafe situations is approximately 91% for the year 2009. This risk analysis figure indicates that the GB Rail Industry’s statement in 2009 
[normal]or 2013 
[normal]that level crossing user is responsible 
[normal]or cause 
[normal]for 92% of 
[normal]level crossings 
[normal]accident is an erroneous statement. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The above results indicate that the GB Railway 
[normal]focal point of 
[normal]attention on risk analysis and human factors using fault and event tree analysis ( Bow Tie Model) as a quantitative risk estimation tool and using specialists for the analysis of human error occurring in the front line activity is not fetching any improvem
[normal]ents in the level of 
[normal]risk. 
[normal]The above calculation shows that the assertion of GB Railway executive and staff that level crossing users are causing 90% of the accidents is an illusion entertained by GB Railway executives and staff from a cultural and social 
[normal]perspective.  
[normal]The method of using event tree analysis suffers from human error problem can be seen from the 
[normal]examination of 
[normal]Figures I and II of the 1979 paper on Prospect Theory
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Author is of
[normal] the firm opinion that the sequential formulation of hazard eve
[normal]nt scenarios leads to errors in subjective assessment as the Bow Tie model does not represent the standard form of decision analysis. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]All of the 
[normal]safety 
[normal]engineering work 
[normal]currently popular with engineering work force evolved from 
[normal]since the start of Boeing 
[normal]missile safety programs uses this form of Bow Tie Modelling and analysis 
[normal](Clifton, 2005)
[normal]. Several authors like James Reason, Nancy 
[normal]Leveson
[normal] and Sir Charles Haddon Cave  apart from author have critiqued this method
[normal] (Reason, 1990)
[normal],
[normal] (Haddon-Cave, 2009)
[normal],
[normal] (Leves
[normal]on, 2011).  Sequential procesing of information may  lead to errors is not a new idea. Arthur Schopenhaur was the first 
[normal]person 
[normal]to moot this idea
[normal] when he remarked that both
[normal] David Hume and Imma
[normal]n
[normal]uel Kant made same type of errors in thei
[normal]r reasoning of cause-ef
[normal]fect rela
[normal]tions. Dav
[normal]id Hume reasoned that consequnce is a mere sequence
[normal] 
[normal]whereas Kant affirms that all sequence must necessarily be  consequnce
[normal](Schopenhauer, 1818)
[normal]. 
[normal]Oppostion advanced by John Stuart Mill in 1861 against 
[normal]the contemperaory practice of then British Civl Service in the form adminstering the rules and regulations is seen by some as the early poineering activity of management (David Clutterbuck, 1990). 
[normal]The 
[normal]19
[normal]th
[normal] century prescriptive approach  to rules and regulations 
[normal]persist
[normal]s
[normal] in the ORR’s regulating practice
[normal] of managing design of level crossings can be inferrred from reading their Guidance on Level Crossings (The Office of Rail Regulator , 2011), (The Office 
[normal]of Rail Regulator, 2008)
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As far as the rational agent model of economic theory
[normal] is concerned
[normal], it is important to note that contracts between the clients like railway undertakings and infrastructure managers 
[normal]and their suppliers 
[normal]rely upon the risk managers
[normal] and Bow Tie models to inform their decisions on 
[normal]hazards
[normal]. These decisions on whether to 
[normal]close out the hazards on their hazard log or do nothing about them as the cost of eliminating the hazards is beyond the specific firm or the railway operator
[normal] and theref
[normal]ore, the real issue of danger at level crossings remain unaddressed
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The nature of remedial measures to eliminate the existing
[normal] man-made
[normal] hazards 
[normal]faced world-wide
[normal] 
[normal]is that the implementation is carried out by the duty –holders but the cost has to be borne 
[normal]by respective nations.  
[normal]Deaths at level crossings may be less in absolute terms when compared to deaths due to other diseases as pointed out by Daniel 
[normal]Kahneman
[normal] in chapter 13 of his book
[normal] (Kahneman, 2011)
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Government intervention is needed 
[normal]as Nobel Laureat
[normal]e Ronald H. 
[normal]Coase
[normal] realised that life is more complex than theory. The approach to solving deaths at level crossing problem cannot be based upon market based mechanisms 
[normal]as the
[normal] transactions costs are not borne by market participants but by outsiders
[normal] of the m
[normal]arket mechanism(Exchange, 2013)
[normal]. Settling by means of praivate out –of –court settlement with level crossings victims does not solve the problem of transactions costs borne by the external parties. This can be seen from the out-of-court settlement made by 
[normal]Network Rail
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Risk assessment is an implicit requirement of the UK Health and Safety at Work etc. Act (HSW, 1974) and is also explicitly required by other general and 
[normal]industry-specific regulations
[normal]. The UK HSE has published research looking at the pitfalls of risk assessment in the period prior to 
[normal]mandating of 
[normal]the Common Safety Method
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Good practice in managing risk at public rail-road interfaces level crossings is to b
[normal]uild bridges. At the private level crossings, where
[normal]ver
[normal] feasible
[normal],
[normal] bridges can be built and where they cannot be 
[normal]closed,
[normal] modern radio communications can be utilised to inform the level crossing user of the train arrival. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The implementation of standard appr
[normal]oach to signalling like ERTMS/ECTS technology does not solve the problem of deaths at 
[normal]public rail –road interface managed by 
[normal]level crossings. By wrongly associating the problem of death at level crossings with the theory of market capitalism, Economists ar
[normal]e distracting attention from the remedial measures that need to be taken. However, availability of barriers may be recorded in the hazard log at the time of safety justification of the start or close out of the railway projects
[normal], granted by RSSB and
[normal] inspect
[normal]ed by the regulator
[normal]. This phenomenon of risk assessment in the ERTMS project did
[normal] figure in the RAIB
[normal] Report on Cambrian ERTMS ABCL Incident
[normal] (
[normal] RAIB, 2012)
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Now, let us consider the data from the UK Law Commission Paper
[normal] 
[normal]available for computing 
[normal]e
[normal]conomics of deaths at level crossings (a rail-road interface). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Cost to the 
[normal]GB 
[normal]economy due to loss of 
[normal]11 FWIs (
[normal]para
[normal] 28) statistical lives on an annual basis at the value of £1.5 million per statistical life, A= £16.5 million. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Cost to the GB economy (
[normal]para
[normal] 18, 19, 20) due to investment on safety measures on eliminating level crossing, 
[normal]D
[normal] is calculated as under
[normal] in the Table 1 on the next page.
[normal] The assumption
[normal]s are that the 
[normal]issues of typography and heritage do not arise.
[normal] Author has n
[normal]ot computed any benefits to the wider economy. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The facts of railways accidents from 1851till date studied by author suggest that these accident scenarios are not available to signalling engineers and managers memory when demanded.  The social DNA of a ra
[normal]ilway engineer(s) and manager(s) cannot associate hazards and barriers as outlined in the author’s publications suggest that the idea that much vaunted learning skills are absent from the railway sector. 
[normal]A PhD in computer science and a signalling system en
[normal]gineering domain expert with over 20 years’ experience in 2001 was surprised when author had suggested random number  generating algorithms were not random  at all. Probably, he did not read publication by 
[normal]I.Mitrani
[normal] where 
[normal]Mitrani
[normal] accepted the argument
[normal] (I.M
[normal]itrani, 1982)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Author wishes to place on record that Mr Anson Jack and Mr David 
[normal]Bulgin
[normal] of RSSB did comprehend the system advanced by the author when he deployed the system at RSSB. Apart from them author did not find any other person competent to grasp th
[normal]e subtleties of risk assessment using cognitive systems engineering during his employment period with RSSB.

[normal]Assuming the disproportion factor in the calculations for loss of statistical life to be 10, then annual loss of statistical life per year = 11*1.5*10= £ 165, 000, 000. 
[normal]Author assumes that
[normal] a 
[normal] higher 
[normal]dis
[normal]-proportionate
[normal] figure was 
[normal]used for recommending the in
[normal]stallation of the TPWS System in 2003.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The ratio of cost of safety measures to the cost of loss lives works out to approximately 50. In other words, 
[normal]it takes 50 years to recover the cost of investment into safety improvements at the rail road interface.
[normal] 
[normal]Author has not considered routes for financing such as debt financing as this theme is beyond author’s skill base. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Work done by James Reason in 1990 has shown that Group-think bias is a major problem that poses threat to the safety of members of public 
[normal]and staff and confirmed by author again in 2010
[normal] (Appicharla, 2010)
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]Given the fact that 
[normal]psychology of railway signalling engineers and managers is
[normal] biased towards measurements 
[normal]of lengths in terms of braking distance (service and emergency) 
[normal]and 
[normal]psychology o
[normal]f human factors and risk managers using 
[normal]means and variance frameworks applied to risk data 
[normal]and human factors data biases them to accept the Cartesian idea that there is no empty space without objects filling it. Nobel Laureate Albert Einstein how our psych
[normal]ological concepts of space and time arise in practice (pp.136-137). Author note
[normal]s
[normal] Albert Einstein’s idea that our auditory experience of hearing 
[normal]a 
[normal]car passing
[normal] by on adjacent 
[normal]road may
[normal] precede our experien
[normal]ce of it 
[normal]appearing visually
[normal] from where we are seated
[normal].
[normal] In other words, time 
[normal]sequence of events cannot be ordered in accordance with 
[normal]time sequence of experiences (pp140)
[normal] (Einstein, 1920)
[normal]. This has implications for modelling hazardous event sequences in the activity of eliciting or describing potential or actua
[normal]l accident scenarios. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Apart from the accident and other case studies p
[normal]ublished since 2006, author 
[normal]experienced managerial incompetence in risk assessment in 
[normal]Indian organisational 
[normal]settings as well. Author recalls his experience 
[normal]during his previous employm
[normal]ent with CEGELEC India between 1994 till 1998, a 
[normal]business unit of French Alcatel
[normal]. A
[normal]uthor 
[normal]found that the executive and managerial staff employed with CEGELEC India did not possess
[normal] sufficient competence on 
[normal]how to perform risk assessment as required by the 
[normal]Al
[normal]catel C
[normal]orporate Guidelines. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the processes deployed within the business acquisition procedure required 
[normal]the bid manager to prepare the estimate of chances to win the bid in a risk assessment
[normal] form
[normal] prior to the bid submission. However, author, as a bid m
[normal]anager, found that the Chief Executive of CEGELEC India made errors in filing the risk assessment form for a  bid  £ 5.8 million at 1997 prices. 
[normal]The bid was won but the project did not materialise. 
[normal]Similarly, another 
[normal]risk assessment form with for a 
[normal]bid wit
[normal]h a value of £58 million was also similarly filled with errors to boost the chances of CEO’s tenure
[normal] in the event of winning the bid
[normal].  The rupee to pound exchange ratio was 70 
[normal]at the time bidding 
[normal]in 1998. 
[normal]Author had brought these facts to the attention of M
[normal]r Allan Davies, the Technical Director at 
[normal]Alstom
[normal] in 1999 vide a private communication
[normal] (Appicharla, April 1999)
[normal].  
[normal]Author learnt subsequently that the bid was lost to a competitor with whom the author had formulated a bid strategy. 
[normal]The 
[normal]CEGELEC India 
[normal]business
[normal] unit and 
[normal]its parent company were subsequently absorbed into 
[normal]Alstom
[normal] India Transmission and Distribution. Author has learnt a lesson from this episode that organis
[normal]ational structures and procedures
[normal] do not provide safe guard against 
[normal]systematic 
[normal]human errors. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]N
[normal]obel Laureate, Daniel 
[normal]Kahneman
[normal] expressed confidence 
[normal]that organisations 
[normal]are better when it comes to avoiding errors, because they naturally think more slowly and have the power to impose orderly procedures. Daniel 
[normal]Kahneman
[normal] hoped organisations can introduc
[normal]e 
[normal]solutions like 
[normal]checklists, reference class forecasting and the 
[normal]premortem
[normal].  Moreover, people can watch another as they approach mine fields (
[normal]pp
[normal]417-418)
[normal] (Kahneman, 2011)
[normal]. 
[normal]Author argues that the hypothesis
[normal] of free market ca
[normal]pitalism can be argued for counter
[normal]-acting 
[normal]against human errors
[normal]. This is a fallacy commonly entertained is shown by the 
[normal]errors in safety research in author’s Written Evidence o
[normal]n 11the November 2013
[normal]. Author’s technical review of the Common Safety Method of Regulation found that it is full of
[normal] latent human errors
[normal] (Appicharla, 2013)
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]Thus, author cannot assent to the confidence expressed by
[normal] 
[normal]Daniel 
[normal]Kahneman
[normal] 
[normal]that organisations are less prone to commit errors. B
[normal]eca
[normal]use 
[normal]authors has shown that 
[normal]judgements on risk decisions can be distorted by
[normal] payoffs and penalties
[normal], or facing saving gestures within
[normal] 
[normal]industry or an organisation.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Author cannot foresee how manslaughter 
[normal]legislation as suggested by the UK Law Commission 
[normal]can be applied to the cases where classes of regulatory, managerial, engineerin
[normal]g and operational hum
[normal]an errors abound
[normal] distorting
[normal] the true picture of 
[normal]decisions
[normal] on safety risk
[normal].
[normal] S
[normal]ilo thinking abounds in 21
[normal]st
[normal] century is admitted by Nobel Laureate 
[normal]G.Baker
[normal] (Baker, 1964)
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]Thus, Behavioural ap
[normal]proach, 
[normal]Free Market Approach 
[normal]or Transactional App
[normal]roach to Economics
[normal] 
[normal]of Risk 
[normal]are unable to guide our thinking in resolving the problem 
[normal]of death at level crossings as all of them require 
[normal]competence on the part of duty-holders to assess risk of the assets they hold
[normal] in their portfolio 
[normal]for delivering the publ
[normal]ic service. . 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Author observes that d
[normal]uty-holders and other railway bodies do not have any long term policy for 
[normal]level crossing emerges
[normal] from the Written and Oral evidence 
[normal]presented 
[normal]to 
[normal]members of 
[normal]the Transport Select Committee. 
[normal]A long term poli
[normal]cy is necessary for eliminating risk posed to members of public  by the level crossings. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As the ongo
[normal]ing huge investment of nearly 
[normal]three billion 
[normal]pounds 
[normal]into new signalling technologies
[normal] may not yield benefits 
[normal]desired 
[normal]if the foregoing discussions
[normal] are taken 
[normal]into account. Therefore, author suggests the idea to the Members of Transport Select Committee that a learning unit dedicated to the identification and assessment of railway hazards and their elimination is vitally necessary as the review of existing level
[normal] crossing acc
[normal]idents shows 
[normal]risk judgements are prone to error
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Author believes that 
[normal]dangerous assets like level crossings may be categorised erroneously as being safe
[normal] when 
[normal]they‘re
[normal] not safe
[normal] and 
[normal]therefore, 
[normal]a cultural
[normal] attitudinal change 
[normal]towards safety 
[normal]standards, risk assessment and accident investigation of level crossing accidents is needed
[normal]. 
[normal]This shift in attitudes cannot be brought about individuals but a body that 
[normal]focusses
[normal] attention on hazards and preventive measures in
[normal] the GB Railway Domain. RSSB, 
[normal]O
[normal]RR 
[normal]and duty-holders together with their support structures and functioning 
[normal]do not satisfy this role is evident from the foregoing conclusions.
