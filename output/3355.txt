[[[About The Royal College of Pathologists]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1              The Royal College of Pathologists (RCPath) is a professional membership organisation with charitable status. It is committed to setting and maintaining professional standards and to promoting excellence in the teaching and practice of pathology. Pathology is the science at the heart of modern medicine and is a core component in 70% of clinical interventions (diagnosis, choice of treatment, efficacy of treatment). The College aims to advance the science and practice of pathology, to provide public education, to promote research in pathology and to disseminate the results. We have members across 19 specialties working in hospital laboratories, universities and industry worldwide to diagnose, treat and prevent illness.

[[[Introduction]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1              In this submission the RCPath focusses on where efficiency gains can be made and where there is a risk of money being wasted.&#xa0;2.2              Pathology is a major clinical service and is involved in most clinical interventions. It drives most healthcare decisions and is a core component in 70% of clinical interventions (diagnosis, choice of treatment, efficacy of treatment). It employs 25,000 staff and costs the NHS in the order of £2.5 billion a year, representing nearly 4% of total NHS expenditure. Demand across virtually all disciplines of pathology has been rising at an average of 10% per annum between 2003-2006 (latest available figures).&#xa0;2.3              The Report of the Second Phase of the Review of NHS Pathology Services in England (The Carter Review) suggested that savings of between 10% and 20% could be achieved through the reconfiguration and consolidation of pathology services. At a national level, this would imply annual savings of £250 - £500 million in total, based on figures for 2005.&#xa0;2.4              The RCPath welcomes this opportunity to submit evidence to the Health Select Committee on this important issue.&#xa0;

[[[variable]]]&#xa0;3.1              The increasing importance of pathology in relation to healthcare cannot be overstated. &#xa0;3.2              There has been a large rise in requests for pathology tests over the past decade, with the not unexpected associated effect on expenditure. Much of this rise seen in pathology test use is justified, and can be related to the development of new clinical guidance, patient pathways, health screening initiatives, Quality Outcomes Framework (QOF) targets and the availability of new, more useful tests – especially in the field of molecular pathology. &#xa0;3.3              There are a number of reasons why demand for pathology services is likely to continue to rise:&#xa0;&#xa0;3.4              There is also evidence that shows a considerable level of inappropriate requesting - some have estimated this to be anywhere between 5% and 98% (Van Walraven C, Naylor CD. Do we know what inappropriate laboratory utilization is? A systematic review of laboratory clinical audits. JAMA 1998; 280: 550-558).&#xa0;3.5              Many benchmarking studies have been carried out looking at the variation in laboratory test ordering between countries, regions and individual hospital wards or general practices. The Diagnostic Atlas of Variation uses audit data that collects information about the entire GP pathology workload reported within England. The data highlights huge differences in test requesting rates for commonly requested tests, much of which cannot be explained by differences in patient case mix between primary care trusts or general practices. While there may be other factors to explain some of the variation, the implication is that there are large instances of both over-requesting and under-requesting of pathology tests.&#xa0;3.6              While this may be down to variable knowledge of how to best use laboratory tests among GPs, there is also the problem of specific test availability, with an effective “diagnostics by postcode” system in place. This means that some of the newer tests are not available at all in some regions of the country due to cost or lack of awareness. An example of this is

[[[ ]]]B-type natriuretic peptide

[[[ ]]]testing for heart failure, where there is patchy use ranging from high to none at all.&#xa0;3.7              Inappropriate over-testing has significant effects on financial expenditure, not only on the direct cost to the laboratory, but also as a result of the costs of subsequent unnecessary, knock-on investigations that may be ordered following the inevitable false positive result. The damage to patient care may, however, be even more significant, with inappropriate investigations leading to inappropriate interpretation and indeed incorrect diagnoses. In addition, the diversion of much valued resources towards paying for unnecessary investigations means that the opportunity cost that could be used to accelerate much needed new developments and services is delayed or even lost. Under-requesting has similar effects with many patients missing out on much needed investigations, resulting in missed or delayed diagnosis or management.&#xa0;3.8              Patients rely on their GPs to request the right tests to correctly diagnose and monitor a range of health conditions, such as diabetes or heart disease. GPs also use a range of tests to screen people at risk of a disease even where there is no evidence of the disease. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has issued a number of guidelines for the use of pathology laboratory tests by GPs. Despite this, The Royal College of Pathologists has evidence that GPs’ use of these tests is highly variable. It is too often not cost-effective and not always in the best interests of patients. The College thinks that more specialist pathologist input into GP requesting of tests can improve efficiency.  &#xa0;

[[[Magnitude of variation]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1              The College has collated evidence that includes studies examining the use by GP practices of a number of tests including:

There was wide variability in test request rates and the practices with the highest request rates for these tests were also the highest requesters for all other blood tests. There was no relationship between request rates for HbA1c and thyroid function and the known prevalence of diabetes and hypothyroidism respectively or with Quality and Outcome Framework scores used through the General Medical Services contract to remunerate GP practices.&#xa0;4.3              

[[[The Atlas of Variation Data]]]

[[[ ]]]showed wide variation in the testing for and monitoring of ovarian cancer. Carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA-125), is a protein found on the surface of ovarian cancer cells, and in some normal tissues. It is a tumour marker for ovarian cancer. Traditionally, the CA-125 test has been used to monitor treatment for ovarian cancer and to detect whether cancer has returned after treatment has been completed. CA-125 is also elevated in association with other ovarian pathologies. Most of the use for both of these tests is in the confirmation of a suspected diagnosis and in the monitoring of the response to treatment. Specialist units are the main users of these tests, although some testing takes place in general practice. Data regarding use of this test is available for Primary Care Trust (PCT) level only.

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.4              For PCTs in England, the estimated rate of use for CA-125 tests ordered by GPs ranged from 0.11 to 9.0 per 1,000 practice population (80-fold variation). When the five PCTs with the highest estimated rates and the five PCTs with the lowest estimated rates are excluded, the range is 0.92-8.4 per 1,000 practice population and the variation 9-fold. This is not due to differences in the prevalence of ovarian cancer. Some variation probably reflects differences in professional practice and commissioning prioritisation. &#xa0;4.5              The variation shown for the CA-125 test is seen across almost every test investigated in this study for the Atlas of Variation. (The Atlas of Variation Data has not yet been released for publication; the data are obtained as part of a data quality audit and subject to strict governance protocols. Pathology messages to primary care were intercepted for a period of 23 days in June 2012. In all 1.8 million messages containing samples of 38 million test results for approximately 3 million patients on 1,029 tests from 152 NHS laboratory sources were analysed. Its data is intended to support local decision making to increase the value that a population receives from the resources spent on their healthcare.)&#xa0;4.6              Regardless of whether the variation reveals over or under requesting, this variation reflects inefficient use of NHS resource and may indicate overall unacceptable levels of health care. &#xa0;

[[[Pathology Demand Optimisation (PDO)]]]&#xa0;5.1              In 2013, the RCPath set up a Pathology Demand Optimisation (PDO) Group comprised of representatives from the major pathology disciplines, pathology societies, industry representatives, the National Pathology Programme and lay involvement. The purpose of this initiative was to allow the major pathology stakeholders to work with already established leaders in the field of Laboratory Demand Management research to enable the development of specific Pathology Demand Management Guidance in the form of a toolkit of recommendations and a Minimum Retesting Interval (MRI) advisory strategy. &#xa0;5.2              The use of MRIs is of vital importance and aims to define the minimum time interval whereby tests should be repeated. This avoids unnecessary repeat testing – a common problem in secondary care with laboratory tests frequently being repeated whenever the patient crosses an interface of care, such as a ward transfer. This is of increasing importance following commissioning and the inherent risk of multiple pathology providers. While developments with the National Laboratory Medicine Catalogue (NLMC), which should improve communication and transferability of pathology results, will help, the availability of consensus, peer reviewed or in some cases evidence based MRIs are essential.&#xa0;5.3              When MRIs are defined, they will need to be implemented.&#xa0; The benefits of defining and implementing MRIs include:&#xa0;&#xa0;5.4              In summary, Pathology Demand Optimisation is of vital importance to ensure the right test is done to the right patient at the right time, ensuring the best use of scarce NHS resource and the best possible outcomes for patients. The RCPath continues to drive this process through initiatives such as the NLMC to improve the interoperability (sharing) of pathology test results and the Pathology Demand Optimisation guidance to provide a consistent approach to managing requests for pathology testing..

[[[Reconfiguration]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.1              The RCPath supports the development of consolidated networks for pathology services to help improve the quality and safety of patient care as outlined in The Report of the Second Phase of the Review of NHS Pathology Services in England, December 2008 (The Carter Review). This said that, “Service consolidation is necessary to transform pathology services so that they can respond swiftly to the challenges presented by innovation …, system reform across the NHS and reform of the workforce. Consolidation provides the means of improving service quality, responsiveness and cost-effectiveness by enabling resources to be reinvested in pathology services. Reinvestment of savings is essential to deliver and assure service quality, and to support the rapid adoption of innovative new technology and new approaches to the delivery of pathology services.”&#xa0;6.2              The College thinks that the picture today is radically different from Lord Carter’s vision; far from a service that is integrated and patient-centred the commissioning process has so fare been driven by financial considerations. &#xa0;6.3              The College has warned that that there will be a detrimental effect on services from failed reconfigurations, as well as the high costs incurred. Using information from a Freedom of Information request, the Health Service Journal (HSJ) put at £2 million the central costs of three regional pathology reorganisations in the former NHS Midlands and East Strategic Health authority (HSJ 30 August 2013).&#xa0;6.4              Most recently, a £500 million pathology reorganisation in the West Midlands collapsed after the commissioners opted to abandon a controversial procurement exercise (HSJ, 16 September 2013).6.5              Other drains on resources when there is uncertainty over reconfiguration include: wasted staff time; lower productivity and poor staff morale; problems retaining and recruiting staff and the resulting need to recruit from agencies. All of these issues risk affecting affect the service provided and the quality of patient care.&#xa0;6.6              The College is working to address some of these concerns with the production of:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;6.7              It is vital that pathology services are designed and built around patient need. As a major clinical service driving most healthcare decisions, pathology is the keystone of diagnoses and treatment. During this period of large scale pathology reconfiguration and commissioning of services to multiple providers it is vital that pathology services are efficient and retain sufficient quality and consistency across the NHS. &#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
