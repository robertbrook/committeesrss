"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;AFS0071Written evidence submitted by Jane Eades&#xa0;&#xa0;One of the problems in commenting on whether academies \nnarrow the gap for disadvantaged children is that information is increasingly difficult to obtain. \n&#xa0;\nThe information on GCSE results has changed and only recently has the performance of children on free school meals been included. \n&#xa0;\nThe information on the Df\nE website is more difficult to find, which means that individuals have greater difficulty in challenging the misinformation given out by Ministers.\n&#xa0;\nHowever, comparing the percentages of the SEN figures for academies between 2008 and 2010 is interesting. \n&#xa0;\nIt shows that, on average, Academies are reducing the percentages of children who have special needs.\n&#xa0;\nYr of opening\nAverage change in SEN\n \n2008-2010\nAverage Change in St or SA+ 2008 - 2010\n2002\n-5.2%\n-11.5%\n2003\n-3.5%\n-1.8%\n2004\n-1.7%\n-0.5%\n2005\n-4.4%\n-2.6%\n2006\n-9.4%\n-9.3%\n2007\n-7.5%\n-5.0%\n&#xa0;\nSome academies stand out in terms of the drop in the %age of those who were statemented or on school action plus: \nHarris Academy, East Dulwich - 12.4%;\nJohn Medejski Academy, -18.3%; \nPaddington Academy, -19.3%; \nHavelock Academy, -10.6%. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThose which stick out for an overall drop in special needs are: \nSt Aidan's Academy, -21%; \nHarris Academy, South Norwood, -15%; \nHavelock Academy, - 15%; \nNew Line Learning, - 12%.\n&#xa0;December 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
