[[[ ]]]Resilience to climate change risk is central to good corporate governance of the extractive industries sector

[[[About Carbon Tracker]]]Carbon Tracker is a non-profit organisation working to align the capital markets with the climate change policy agenda. We are applying our thinking on carbon budgets and stranded assets across geographies and asset classes to inform investor thinking and the regulation of capital markets. We are funded by a number of US and UK charitable foundations. 

[[[Introduction]]]Carbon Tracker welcomes the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills’ decision to open a discussion about current issues surrounding the extractive industries sector. Broadly, we see the current exposure of extractives companies listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) to be undermining London’s position as a global financial centre of excellence. Furthermore, our research reveals a systemic risk sitting on the world’s capital markets due to the mismatch between climate change policy and the business models of these extractives companies. This could lead to significant value destruction for investors if the ‘carbon bubble’ were to burst.We see this period of reflection for the London Stock Exchange after a number of controversies to be an opportunity to marry improvements in both the corporate governance and awareness of climate change risk within investors in the extractive industries sector.&#xa0;

[[[What are the corporate governance concerns raised by the number of extractive industries companies listed in the UK? Are there reputational risks for the UK and UK financial institutions in being a centre for such businesses?]]]Companies come to the LSE to benefit from the UK’s respected corporate governance regime. The combination of growth and good governance should, in theory, represent a compelling proposition for investors. However, the UK has failed to evolve its governance standards to reflect this new type of risk – that the changing energy sector will see significant shifts in value.  Instead London has seen increasing exposure to companies in the extractives industry during the recent commodities boom.  These companies do not represent best practice in terms of corporate governance or addressing climate risk. Two very recent examples demonstrate this fact.The Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC) was one of several companies that the UK listings authority allowed to list on the LSE even though its free float of shares was below the usual 25% threshold. This decision has since come into question amid allegations of corruption, bribery and a criminal investigation as its value plummeted from £13bn to £3bn resulting in huge shareholder loss– in essence, those behind the group failed to meet the standards of a public company.The second reputational hit on the LSE involved Bumi PLC, described as ‘the biggest corporate scandal to hit London for two decades’ by the Wall Street Journal. It has been revealed that Bumi was sitting on unaccounted payments of $201m – investors’ expectations about corporate governance at Bumi, assumed from being listed on the LSE, were not met. Bumi’s shares have fallen by a quarter in value.These cases have dealt a huge blow to the reputation of London as a centre for excellence in business. However, in spite of these warning signs, London continues to encourage extractives companies to its exchange. Glencore/Xstrata recently listed on the LSE and Sibanthracite have documented they will be listing here soon, with Mongolian coal companies set to follow. Corporate governance as a practice is designed to have the long-term security of a corporation at its core. Therefore, misdemeanours in corporate governance often run through into the fundamental business models of these companies, meaning London may not just be vulnerable to reputational hits, but investors’ value and market integrity could be at risk also. For example, Bumi’s business model relies on exporting poor quality coal to China, but is that viable on an ongoing basis given recent Chinese announcements on tackling air quality and carbon intensity? 

[[[Has the boom in London-listed ext]]]

[[[ractive companies with businesses overseas over the last two decades resulted in a strengthening in the UK’s competitive position in the sector?]]]London’s boom in listed extractive companies could position it at a significant competitive disadvantage in the future. Carbon Tracker’s research reveals the potential for significant value-destruction of the fossil fuel assets on which the business models of the corporations rely at the hands of environmental regulation and market forces. The LSE is not currently factoring this risk into its corporate governance requirements of listings regulations.Our analysis demonstrates that there are more proven fossil fuel reserves listed on the world’s stock exchanges than can be burnt unmitigated if we are to stay below 2°C of global warming, (the objective agreed in the Cancun Accord),. Our analysis has been confirmed by the International Energy Agency who calculated that ‘without a significant deployment of CCS, more than two thirds of current proven fossil-fuel reserves cannot be commercialised in a 2°C world before 2050’, (based on a 50% chance of limiting global warming to 2°C,). Lord Stern described it as a ‘profound contradiction between climate change policy and the valuations of listed companies’. In this context, the risks of an over-reliance on fossil fuels is apparent, yet one fifth of the FTSE100 is mining and oil and gas firms, accounting for approximately 30% of the total market capitalisation. Carbon Tracker research found that the LSE has reserves listed on it equivalent to around 10 times the UK CO2 budget between now and 2050 to keep within 2°C of global warming. Additionally, most of these reserves are located overseas exposing investors to decision-making and political processes around high carbon assets in which they have no say. For example, a third of coal listed in London is located in Australia, a market which exports 90% of its coal, and where a number of factors are combining to raise costs and make their assets increasingly uncompetitive globally.London is also the primary listing for a number of oil and gas majors. These corporations are increasingly reliant on oil which is hard to get at because almost all the most easily extractable reserves have been exploited. Essentially this means they are producing less and less oil for every dollar of shareholders’ funds invested. Alongside the corporate controversies which come with the sector - BP’s oil spills at Macondo and Shell’s costly and contested drilling in the Arctic, for example – the LSE is housing companies exposing investors to an increasing level of risk that only provides returns at a high oil price. In this context, the LSE’s encouragement and incentivisation to attract more extractives companies further inflates the carbon bubble and the potential downfall if it bursts. Companies are not currently required to provide analysis of sensitivity of their business to low demand, low price scenarios, which would see a number of companies with impaired assets that were no longer economic.

[[[ould increased regulation for London listed extractives companies result in ]]]

[[[competition]]]

[[[ from elsewhere or can it be used to make the UK a centre of excellence for best practice and corporate governance?]]]We feel increased regulation and requirements of companies coming to London to raise capital is necessary to re-establish the UK and London as a reputable global financial centre. Our research reveals climate change is a risk to a corporation’s prosperity, yet there are no requirements from the UK listings authority or the LSE to disclose or even consider climate change in its business strategy. For example, in Glencore’s 1,637-page prospectus for its initial public offering to list on the LSE, just a single paragraph noted climate risk – ‘regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could also have a material adverse effect on the demand for Glencore’s products’. This boilerplate statement gives investors no idea of how significant company management consider the risk to be.Markets need not be resistant to change; in fact their success relies on moving with the times and responding to new risks, like climate change. Mining companies coming to the AIM market, a sub-market of the LSE, are encouraged to seek a Competent Persons report to verify the existence of fossil fuel reserves. This needs to be extended to consider the impacts of climate risk for reserves levels and business models as increasing emissions constraints come in and scaled up to the full LSE. UK Business Secretary, Vince Cable, supports being a first-mover by stating recently that ‘London can teach other centres how it [corporate governance] should be done’, but needs to reflect this in actions.London has historically set the standards for other markets to follow, which has given it a competitive advantage due to the extra reputational benefits of listing in London. Unless London maintains this position, it will find itself having to compete more with other exchanges that have not built up the same historic reputation.

[[[What is the impact of the i]]]

[[[ndustry of the UK signing up to the EITI?]]]The LSE’s recent action to join the Extractives Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) takes important steps to enhancing the exchange by encouraging the disclosure of revenues from coal, oil and gas development. This reflects the requirements of the US Dodd Frank Act and EU Accountability requirements. It is also fitting, given the UK’s lead in establishing the EITI. However revenue transparency only occupies a small part of what is required. The UK should take a similar leadership position on requiring climate risk disclosure, specifically with regards to the CO2 potential of their fossil fuel reserves. This information would allow investors to track exposure to high-carbon assets themselves, and observe if this was increasing or decreasing over time. Our research reveals the extent to which the LSE is exposed to over-valued and potentially worthless fossil fuel assets. Regulation and listings rules need to be aligned with this threat to maintain the UK’s position as a global standard-setter. The UK has led with the Climate Change Act and setting carbon budgets; this needs to be transferred across to its oversight of London as a major global financial centre. Without having market wide information on the exposure to this issue it will not be possible for regulators or investors to understand the level of exposure in London. At present there is a risk that investors who track the market seeking diversification are in fact ending up with a concentration in fossil fuel based businesses.

[[[What is the competitive landscape for the extractive industries in the 21]]]

[[[st]]]

[[[ Century and is it in the UK’s interest to remain a global centre for them? ]]]The landscape for the extractives industries going forward sees them having to adapt to a low-carbon energy future or be comprehensively uncompetitive as their market shrinks. This transition may take time but the signals are apparent. Analysts at Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Citi see the first step is for coal to be a poor investment, primarily due to environmental regulations, China peaking its demand and market forces favouring cheaper gas.Unlike countries like Norway, the UK does not have vast sovereign wealth funds to finance sustainable energy infrastructure for future generations. Instead it will be the UK’s financial markets that will need to adapt – enhanced regulation and requirements can guide this transition. For the UK to remain competitive going forward is needs to be getting ahead in the growth industries of a low carbon future. Otherwise this opportunity will be capitalised on elsewhere. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7b8716a6-0ef7-11e3-ae66-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2dFyOymGZ http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324880504578296122247181726.html  http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/cop_16/application/pdf/cop16_lca.pdf   http://www.carbontracker.org/linkfileshare/Unburnable-Carbon-Full-rev2.pdf http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/publications/weo-2012/ http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/52f2709c-20f0-11e1-8a43-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2NsqYpw7h www.carbontracker.org/london  http://www.carbontracker.org/australia  http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21582522-day-huge-integrated-international-oil-company-drawing  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/629f9a52-2283-11e2-b606-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=uk#axzz2AodKf6eB  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3ec3eec8-ead6-11e2-9fcc-00144feabdc0.html
