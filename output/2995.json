"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Local Government Association (SRN 014)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;1.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe Local Government Association (LGA) is the national voice of local government. \nWe work with councils to support, promote and improve local government.\n&#xa0;\n1.2.\n&#xa0; \nWe are a politically-led, cross party organisation which works on behalf of councils to ensure local \ngovernment has a strong, credible voice with national government.  We aim to influence and set the political agenda on the issues that matter to councils so they are able to deliver local solutions to national problems.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n2.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe Strategic Roads Network \n(SRN) \nshould not be considered in isolation from the local roads network or from transport \nprovision \nas a whole.\n For instance, roads policy should be considered alongside, and integrated with, rail policy.\n \nThis reflects an under\nlying principle running through the LGA’s  campaign, \nRewiring Public Services\n, \nwhich argues\n for\n a\n joined up\n approach to\n infrastructure investment\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.\n&#xa0; \nRoute based assessments need to be a genuine coproduction between local authorities and the Highways Agency\n and need to consider all modes of transport and the local road network\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.3.\n&#xa0; \nInvestment in the SRN needs to be coordinated with the Strategic Economic Plans produced by \nLocal Enterprise Partnerships (\nLEPs\n)\n,\n as well as existing City Deal agreements.\n&#xa0;\n2.4.\n&#xa0; \nT\no avoid gridlock on our roads, including the SRN, \ncouncils need greater influence over local transport provision\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.5.\n&#xa0; \nThe Department for Transport’s (DfT)\n traffic estimates \ndo not represent guaranteed futures which must be accommodated. \nFuture traffic levels \ndepend on the policies pursued today.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;6.1.\n&#xa0; \nAction for Roads\n concerns itself chiefly with the \nSRN. \nH\nowever it recognises that ‘almost every journey starts or ends’ on the 98 per cent of the road network for which councils are responsible. \n&#xa0;\n6.2.\n&#xa0; \nThe SRN cannot therefore be considered in isolation from the local roads network\n or \nlocal transport as a whole\n (si\nnce\n traffic on the local network is influenced by the provision of alternative transpor\nt).\n&#xa0;\n6.3.\n&#xa0; \nThis is true in three ways in particular:\n&#xa0;\n6.3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe tendency of new roads to generate ‘induced traffic’ is a well-established fact and has led previous road building sch\nemes to fail to deliver anticipated benefits. Indeed as \nAction for Roads\n points out \n“\nroads support job creation and unlock new development\n”\n. This is good news when the traffic generated as a result can be accommodated (and when the developments are \ngenuinely new rather than relocated)\n. However, \nwhere the intention\n \nbehind investment in the SRN is to encourage development, the ability of the local roads network to handle more traffic will have to be carefully considered as part of the investment plan. \n&#xa0;\n6.3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhere the aim of increasing SRN capacity is to relieve congestion investment needs to be \nplanned in a manner that avoids creating\n substantial new traffic. Ignoring local transport provision while expanding the capacity of the SRN to meet a 46 per cent tr\naffic increase by 2040 will simply move people more quickly between gridlocked local roads. \n&#xa0;\n6.3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMany of the current journeys on the SRN are relatively short-distance journeys which could be diverted from it by changes to local transport arrangements – either\n local road improvements or public transport alternatives. \n&#xa0;\n6.4.\n&#xa0; \nThe tasks above cannot be performed by central government alone but will re\nquire effective coordination between \ncentral and local government.\n&#xa0;\n6.5.\n&#xa0; \nIn practical\n terms we think three developments are required:\n&#xa0;\n6.5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCouncils need to be\n equal partners\n in devising the route based strategies that will provide the basis of investment in the SRN\n&#xa0;\n6.5.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe programme of investment in the SRN needs to be \ncombined\n with investment in\n local major schemes via the Local Growth Fund and agreements reached through the City Deal process\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.5.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCouncils need to be able to manage traffic effectively both through direct traffic management means and indirectly via the provision of alternative means \nof transport.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe Government has spoken encouragingly of involving local authorities in devising the route based strategies which are intended to shape the \nprogramme of investment in the SRN. These discussions are supposed\n to be completed in time to feed\n into\n a Roads Investment Strategy\n,\n to be published by 2015.\n&#xa0;\n7.2.\n&#xa0; \nThe route-based strategy approach offers an opportunity to make investment in roads more effective and is one the LGA supports. However, it remains to be seen how \neffectively the Highways Agency will engage with councils on this programme of work. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;8.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe development of the Roads Investment Strategy needs to be \ncombined\n with transport investment through the LGF.\n&#xa0;8.2.\n&#xa0; \nAction for \nRoads\n refers to the Government’s efforts:\n “\nto free up other money that local authoriti\nes use to fund larger projects…\nreduce the strings attached to local funding for major schemes\n”, and decentralise “\ndecision-making to reduce the number of situations where\n councils need to get approval from Whitehall before starting work\n”\n&#xa0;\n8.3.\n&#xa0; \nHowever\n,\n it is now clear that central control of spending has not been abolished and that\n,\n instead of the original DfT proposal to allocate money to Local Transport Boards, LEPs will now\n have to compete for funds through their Strategic Economic Plans. \n&#xa0;\n8.4.\n&#xa0; \nAt the time of writing it is unclear on what basis these plans will be judged, but it does seem that the timetable for their production means that work on them \nneeds to be completed befor\ne anyone knows the order of priority in the roads programme. We believe that drafting a plan for transport in a LEP area with no knowledge of the timetable for i\nmproving the SRN in that area, \nor even knowledge\n of what measures might be used, \nadds to the co\nmplexity of the task and makes it more likely that the conclusions reached will be open to question. This problem is exacerbated \nif an effective relationship has not developed between \nthe Highways Agency \nand the relevant LEP(s). \n&#xa0;\n8.5.\n&#xa0; \nOfficials at the Departme\nnt for Transport and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills \nare working hard with local authorities and LEPs to bring clarity to these pro\ncesses and address these issues. However, \nwe struggle to see how it will be possible to sensibly align the\n roads programme and local transpo\nrt investment plans within the G\novernment’s timetable. In any case\n,\n this process is not devolution. If the sums in the LGF were truly devolved\n,\n councils would be better placed to manage the uncertainty over the\n \nRoads Inves\ntment Strategy\n because \nthey would not have to commit themselves on other investment according to a centrally-\ndetermined political timetable (\nbased on the dates of general elections\n)\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;9.1.\n&#xa0; \nIf these investment programmes are to deliver best value they need to be accompanied by effective traffic management at local level and the provision of alternative transport facilities\n,\n including encoura\ngement for cycling and walking. However, \ncouncils cu\nrrently lack the tools to do \nthis.\n \n&#xa0;9.2.\n&#xa0; \nAction for Roads\n is right to recognise \nthe “\nneed to give local authorities the freedom, the flexibility and the capacity\n”\n to \n“\nshape the future of their local transport – especially the roles to be played by roads, by di\nfferent types of public transport and by cycling\n”\n. To date however\n,\n the current government has not lived up to its initial promises of devolution in transport.\n&#xa0;\n9.3.\n&#xa0; \nCouncils understand better than anyone that there is no bottomless pit of cash to solve ou\nr \ntransport (or other) problems\n. If local transport networks are to b\ne improved we need\n to\n innovate, rather than simply\n spend more. If we are to get best value from transport investment\n,\n councils need to be positioned to consider local transport as a whole\n. This would allow them to \nencourage the use of alternative modes where this is effective while increasing capacity to the local road network through intelligent interventions, both to accommodate increased traffic arriving from the SRN and to reduce the i\nmpact of local traffic on the SRN. If councils are to take the measures necessary to avoid gridlock in the next two decades they will need:\n&#xa0;\n9.3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPowers in \nP\nart 6 \nof the \nTraffic Management Act \n2004 \nto enforce moving traffic offences\n;\n9.3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEffective leverage to influ\nence bus and train operating companies to ensure a local transport network that serves the needs of business\nes\n and communities\n; \n9.3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAdequate funding to maintain the local road network; and\n9.3.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMeaningful devolution of investment funds\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;10.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn answering this question it is important to bear in mind what the Government itself says about these \nforecast\ns\n:\n “\nThe NTM Road Traffic Forecasts should not be viewed as what we think will actually happen in the future, or what we want the future to look like. The forecasts are what may happen, based on: \nOur current understanding of how people make travel c\nhoices\n; \nThe expected path of key drivers of travel demand\n; \nAssuming no change in government policy beyond that already announced\n”\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n10.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn other words\n,\n the forecasts are not a given around which policy must be constructed, but the likely outcome of existing \npolicy. Uncertainty around that outcome merely highlights the opportunity for a different set of outcomes to be achieved by different policies.\n&#xa0;10.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe LGA does not advocate a particular national polic\ny. H\nowever\n,\n the prospect of pursuing a policy of \n‘\npredict \nand provide\n’\n along the mid-range estimate of a 46 per cent increase in traffic on the SRN over the next 25 years\n (as suggested by the Government’s forecast)\n poses the question of  \nw\nhat will happen to this additional traffic when it leaves the SRN? \n&#xa0;\n10.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Df\nT’s estimates suggest an increase in traffic outside the SRN of \n23\n-64% leading to an increase in non-SRN congestion of 25-101%. However\n,\n the real picture will be much worse for councils than this suggests, as that congestion will be concentrated in particu\nlar areas, implying an increase in traffic in main urban centres which they \nwould struggle to \naccommodate.\n&#xa0;\n10.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAction for Roads\n appears to gloss over this prospect by claiming that: “Strategic roads may be under more pressure than their local counterparts. \nBetween 2000 and 2012, the last year for which there is confirmed data, motorists drove an extra ten billion miles on strategic roads, while traffic was steady on the rest of the network”.\n&#xa0;\n10.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis is \nmisleading since \nbetween 2000 and 2007 traffic \nactually \ngrew on both SRN and local networks\n. Since then, \nSRN traffic levels have stabilised while traffic on the local roads network has fallen to 2000 levels. In other words when the economy was doing well local traffic was increasing and we suspect that pressure\n on local roads will increase by more than DfT predicts as the economy recovers.\n&#xa0;\n10.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA 46 per cent increase in traffic is not inevitable. Nor is it desirable on an across the board basis. It is clear that road freight transport will be the essential carrier \nof economic growth in the next quarter of a century and that the car will remain essential for many journeys, especially in rural areas. This makes it all the more important to provide alternative forms of transport where possible\n,\n so that the essential ca\nr and lorry journeys are not made impossible or inefficient by congestion. \n&#xa0;\n10.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis reinforces the points we have made previously about the need for local authorities to be empowered to deliver better transport and free up the local road network.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;11.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have already set out the reasons why we think a localist\n approach is necessary to deliver improved reliability and efficiency on the SRN.\n&#xa0;11.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCouncils are continuing to invest in, and innovate with, the use of new technology when it comes to their management of the local road network. \n&#xa0;\nDeeper engagement between lo\ncal authorities and the Highways Agency \ncould provide further opportunities for improving and sharing respective expertise and technologies across the SRN and the local network. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;12.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe LGA has already called for the G\novernment to boost investment in infrastructure by re-creating the thriving market in mu\nnicipal bonds which England once had and most other countries still have.\n&#xa0;12.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTransport is a prime example of where such measures could help lever in private funding and have a significant impact on the ability of local councils to a\nddress local transport problems, as well as \ncontribute to the solution of national ones as a consequence.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;13.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe LGA believes that the key reform to the Highways Agency\n, which in itself is long overdue,\n must be to ensure that it engages effectively\n with local authorities. This must ha\nppen\n not only \nwhen it comes to\n devising route based strategies\n, but also \nin\n respect to\n devising and developing the Strategic Economic Plans\n which\n LEPs have been asked to deliver as bids for local growth funds. \n&#xa0;13.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor too long the Highways Agency has been \nseen\n,\n and has seen itself\n,\n as an organisation that only deals with the SRN and this has led to that network being treated as something that exists in isolation from local transport networks. In reality\n,\n strategic routes are at the heart of an area’s transp\nort picture. \n&#xa0;\n13.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf the country at large\n,\n and local areas\n,\n are to maximise the benefit from our SRN\n,\n then it is critical that businesses and local leaders are at the heart of decision making for all our strategic routes.\n The Highways Agency must become more \nholistic in its approach, and consider its impact on housing delivery  and other local services. \n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6\n&#xa0;\n More information on the campaign is available on the LGA website: \nhttp://www.local.gov.uk/publications/-/journal_content/56/10180/4047947/PUBLICATION\n \n‘Action for R\noads\n’\n is available at \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/212590/action-for-roads.pdf\n .
