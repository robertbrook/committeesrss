[[[Written evidence from John Dwyer, Police and Crime Commissioner, Cheshire [CST0041]]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[What, if any, targets do you set for your police force? What impact do you think this has on police recording crime practices?]]]&#xa0;The only target set by my Police and Crime Plan is that of reducing crime, there are no targets set for individual crime types nor for detection. However contained within my plan there are measures to allow me to perform my statutory functions and hold the Chief Constable to account for the performance of the Constabulary. These have been developed and agreed with the Constabulary, in order to ensure that they result in effective and meaningful data and to make certain that they do not result in perverse incentives, thus driving bad practice. &#xa0;

[[[How do you assure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct? To what exte]]]

[[[nt can you trust the crime statistics for your area? ]]]&#xa0;The Constabulary rigorously audits its crime recording, analysing anomalies to understand the reasons for them and this is scrutinised by me as part of my scrutiny processes. This process includes quarterly Public Scrutiny Boards and monthly meetings with the Chief Constable and his Chief Officer team. I believe the Constabulary’s crime recording to be good, it was judged as such by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary in 2010 and I look forward to a further inspection of crime recording in the New Year. I have also commissioned a piece of work to be undertaken by the Audit Committee which will review the integrity of crime recording practices in Cheshire and provide me with additional reassurance that standards are being properly applied. &#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
