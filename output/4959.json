"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nLife Cycle UK\n (CYS0112)\nL\nife Cycle UK believes that cycling is a safe activity in Britain’s towns and cities.  However, we recognise that many people do not feel safe, particularly when they don’t have the skills to cycle in traffic.  \nLife Cycle does not believe that the answer t\no improving safety lies in segregating cyclists from cars, although we recognise that on some routes this is appropriate. \nLife Cycle 15- year experience of delivering cycle training shows that  the provision of high quality  training to people of all ages,\n can ensure they have the appropriate skil\nls to negotiate traffic safely, understand how to choose routes that have less traffic giving them the confidence to be safe on the roads. \n&#xa0;\nBikeability\n should be available to \nchild\nren \nfro\nm year 5 onwards, and also available to all secondary school age children.  We believe that \nchildren and young people are ready to start cycling at different stages in their development and \ntraining should be \navailable to support them at the point when the\ny are ready, not only in Primary School. \n \nLife Cycle trained 650 adults to the National Standard in 2013 to cycle safely on the \nroads\n of Bristol enabling them to feel safe and confident to cycle.  However, cycle training is not widely\n available and is dependent on the priorities of local government. We believe the provision of low-cost high quality adult cycle training should be universally available to adults, wherever they live in England.  \n&#xa0;\nEmployers should be incentivised to encou\nrage staff who cycle to take up opportunities for training. \n&#xa0;\nAs part of the \nstandard driving test, and the HGV licence test, \nwe believe that all drivers should be given cyclist aw\na\nreness training. This needs to increase their und\nerstanding of how and why cyclists behave the way the\ny\n do on the \nroa\nd, and \nhow \ndriver’s\n \nshould behave correspondingly.  \nE.g\n the reasons why a cyclist takes a position in the centre of the lane. \n              \nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
