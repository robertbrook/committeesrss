default&#xa0;
defaultIntroductiondefault&#xa0;
default1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Radio Independents Group (RIG) represents independent radio / audio production companies based all around the UK. These companies are diverse - RIG members make radio for the BBC and commercial networks, plus other audio 
defaultand 
defaultmultimedia co
defaultntent for broadcasters and corporate clients. RIG members account for around 95% of industry turnover. Overall the sector is comprised of 1
default0
default0+ companies, over 1,000 skilled people – and spread all around the UK.
default&#xa0;
default2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRIG greatly welcomes the inquiry into the ‘
defaultFuture of the BBC’, allowing as it does in-depth discussion ahead of the next formal Charter Review process. We hope the following thoughts are useful and would greatly welcome an opportunity to appear before the Committee to discuss the
defaultm
default further. Our subm
defaultission will touch upon many of the themes contained within the Committee’s inquiry, whilst centrally focusing on the Committee’s question: 
default‘What balance should be struck in what the BBC produces in-house, commissions externally and leaves entirely to other
defaults to create?’
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Independent Radio / Audio Production Sectordefault&#xa0;
default3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLike other creative industries, indie radio production companies are set up by entrepreneurs who seek to make diverse innovative content which has creative, cultural and, where appropriate, commercial value. 
default4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe sector is in a position to take its place a
defaultlongside the other creative industries in helping the UK economy to grow. Indie radio production companies already attract advertising and commercial sponsorship around 
defaultprogrammes 
defaulton commercial radio, thus providing a boost to commercial radio income overa
defaultll. 
defaultExamples of indie 
defaultprogrammes 
defaultfor commercial radio are 2013’s Classic FM Christmas Day 
defaultdrama “Bethlehem Tales”
default, made by 
defaultUnique
default (which also provides daily entertainment news on around 150 stations)
default, and 
default‘
defaultThe Ronnie Wood Show
default’
default, made by Somethin’ Else for 
defaultAbsolute Radio. 
default5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOverall the 
defaultindie radio/audio 
defaultsector is estimated to be worth £40m-£50m per annum and growing. Programmes originally commissioned for radio networks are sold on via companies that sell downloads and online streaming
default,
default 
defaultand
default to overseas broadc
defaultasters. Shows such as Folded Wing’s ‘Jamie Cullum Show’, which is syndicated in France, Canada and SE Asia, are proving successful internationally.
default6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEach year indie radio producers win around 30% of product
defaultion-
defaultrelated Sony Gold Awards (the industry’s ‘Oscar
defaults'), including for station branding and multiplatform content. And UK indie radio producers feature prominently at the International Radio Awards 
defaultin New York 
default– this year 
defaultUK indie TBI Media 
defaultwon the ‘Production Company of the Year’ Award and overall UK 
defaultcompanies won 25 awards
default. 
default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAudio production skills are not just important to radio, but to many other creative media sectors, particularly in an industry where skills are increasingly used across different types 
defaultof 
defaultcontent (eg computer games production req
defaultuire many traditional media skills including broadcast-quality sound production) and where content itself is increasingly multiplatform. The sector is investing in skills, and RIG was recently selected to take part in the UKCES Employer Ownership of Skills
default Pilot Scheme to develop skills, apprenticeships and training in the sector.
default&#xa0;
defaultPerspective on the BBCdefault&#xa0;default8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe BBC remains an important public service broadcaster which provides many services which may well not be provided otherwise, either at all or to the bre
defaultadth and depth of that which is currently on offer. The current state of commercial radio, heavily constrained by the need to grow and maintain advertising and sponsorship revenues, shows that it is difficult to produce certain types of content without pub
defaultlic support and a dedicated public service remit. RIG 
defaulttherefore 
defaultsupports both the continuation of the BBC in radio and television, and the Licence Fee as a practical way of collecting the revenue, notwithstanding the need to 
defaulttackle how to deal with the gro
defaultwing number of people accessing the BBC through other devices than the traditional radio or television set.
default&#xa0;
default9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever there is a need for the Licence Fee Payer to benefit as much as possible from the available innovation and creative talent available – and 
defaultwith over 80% of BBC 
defaultRadio’s 
defaultcontent currently ring-fenced for in-house production, 
defaultthe situation 
defaultis
default at present
default far from 
defaultideal
default. 
default&#xa0;
default10.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultargument 
defaultfor more independent production 
defaultgains additional weight in the light of the need for the BBC to be ever more effi
defaultcient and show value for the Licence Fee
default,
default 
defaultat 
defaulta time when it represents a considerable outlay for British households. The BBC needs to be increasingly fleet-of-foot and flexible in the digital converged era. In this context large in-house production centres
default are unwieldy and therefore contrary to this need.
default&#xa0;
defaultCurrent State of BBC Radio Commissioningdefault&#xa0;
default11.
default&#xa0; 
defaultProgress towards 
defaultestablishing 
defaulta more diverse 
defaultrange 
defaultof programme-makers in BBC radio has been slow. A voluntary 10% quota has been operating since 1992. Although i
defaultndies had been successfully supplying 
defaultprogrammes 
defaultover and above that quota, there had been no further move towards allowing the sector to bid for more 
defaultprogrammes
default. 
default&#xa0;
default12.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn 2010 the BBC Trust revie
defaultwed
default the supply of content to BBC radio services. In its conclusions the BBC Trust required the BBC to “demonstrate a clear focus on delivering high quality and distinctive 
defaultprogrammes 
defaultto licence fee payers, in particular through 
defaultensuring the best ideas are com
defaultmissioned regardless of source
default”
default.
default&#xa0;
default13.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAs a first step towards meeting this requirement, the BBC was instructed by the BBC Trust to introduce, in addition to 
defaultthe 10% 
defaultquota, a 
defaultfurther 
default10% Window of Creative Competition (or ‘WoCC’). The intention of the WOCC is 
defaultto allow indie production companies to 
defaultcompete with
default in-house production teams to submit the best ideas for 
defaultprogrammes 
defaultacross the BBC’s radio schedules.
default&#xa0;
default14.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe BBC recently reported on the first year of the WoCC’s operation and it showed that indies were 
defaultsuccessful in winning 80% of WoCC hours, against in-house competition
default.
default&#xa0;
default15.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhere given the chance, indie radio producers have proven success at delivering many types of programming, including large-scale live programmes. The ‘Radio 2 Folk Awards’ at the Albe
defaultrt Hall (produced by Manchester indie Smooth Operations) will be broadcast in January 2014 and TBI Media’s ‘Dambusters Live’ was a 
defaultsignificant success for BBC Radio 2 last May. Indie-produced programmes slot neatly into the most vibrant of BBC radio schedu
defaultles, for 
defaultexample Campbell-Davidson’s award-winning
default ‘Danny Baker Show’ and World’s End’s ‘Fighting Talk’ on a Saturday matchday morning on Radio 5Live. Shows such these and other examples such as ‘The Reunion’, made by Whistledown for BBC Radio 4, also dem
defaultonstrate the compelling original formats created by indies companies. Using indies also allows different production teams to contribute to a 
defaultstrand
default, for example the ethical and religious discussion programme ‘Something Understood’, which is made variously 
defaultby 
defaultUnique Productions, Falling Tree Productions and 
defaultWhistledown
default Productions for Radio 4.
default&#xa0;
default16.
default&#xa0; 
defaultHowever RIG has been monitoring the types of 
defaultWoCC 
defaultprogrammes 
defaultawarded
default to indies and, rather than being a diverse set of 
defaultprogrammes 
defaultfrom across the schedule, it has bee
defaultn found that WoCC commissions
default,
default especially on Radio 2 and Radio 1 / 1xtra, have been low-cost strands
default out of peak listening hours. The simple fact is that there are no independent productions on Radio 2 in daytime during the week. 
defaultThis leads to a feeling 
defaulton the part of our members 
defaultthat there is a form of 
defaultprotectio
defaultnism
default being practised 
defaultin BBC Radio
default, contrary to the Trust’s requirement to allow Licence Fee Payers access to the best ideas regardless of source.
default&#xa0;
default17.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIndie producers are confident that their producti
defaultons are not obtained at any greater cost than a BBC in-house production. However to this date a
default d
defaultirect comparison of the cost of an in-house production and indie production has not been possible
default,
default due to the fact that the BBC’s accounting is less than trans
defaultparent 
defaultwhen it comes to the overall cost of an in-house production
default.
default RIG has had conversations with the BBC on this issue on many occasions but the information has yet to be made available.
default&#xa0;
default‘defaultEligible Hours’default&#xa0;
default18.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt should be noted that all the hours made avail
defaultable to TV and radio indies - either through the quota or the WoCC - are expressed as a proportion of those deemed ‘eligible’. These ‘eligible’ hours exclude news, current affairs
default, repeats and continuity broadcasts. 
defaultBearing in mind the amount of news on BB
defaultC networks, the amount of hours open to indie radio companies is therefore significantly less than 20%. All percentages cited should be viewed 
defaultin the knowledge
default that they represent less of a proportion of BBC 
defaultprogrammes 
defaultthan it might appear.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Lessons defaultfrom BBC TV Commissioningdefault&#xa0;
default19.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt is important to consider what has happened in BBC television commissioning. As far back as the 1980s the Government realised it was important to develop an independent TV production sector, to allow more creativity and innovat
defaultion to take place and supply the PSB networks with a broader range of talent
default,
default voices and ideas. Hence the introduction of a 25% TV indie production quota in the 1990 Broadcasting Act, and also the creation in 1982 of Channel 4 and S4C, whose publisher-broa
defaultdcaster model means they commissions all of their content from indies.
default&#xa0;
default20.
default&#xa0; 
defaultSubsequently the Government enshrined 
defaultindie TV 
defaultproducers’ intellectual property rights in the 2003 Communications Act, which has made sure that terms of trade between 
defaultthose 
defaultproducers a
defaultnd PSB broadcasters are overseen by Ofcom.
default&#xa0;
default21.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAll of this has resulted in one of the most successful TV production sectors in the world, responsible for ever-growing exports of programmes and formats and a burgeoning sector which remains a success story even
default in times of economic difficulty.
default&#xa0;
default22.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe next step for TV will be to move further towards competition for commissioning over and above the 50% currently available – ie the removal of the current 50% ‘in-house guarantee’. The BBC’s Creative Director, Alan Yen
defaulttob, told the 2013 Edinburgh TV Festival that he predicted that the in-house guarantee in TV might be removed within five years
default.
default&#xa0;
default23.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhilst radio / audio would never be on the same scale in terms of sheer amounts of money involved, it nevertheless has the ca
defaultpacity and ability to grow much 
defaultlarger
default, both in the UK and internationally. In the case of the lat
defaultt
defaulter
default,
default formats, skills and expertise can be exported to countries with existing or developing radio services, such as India or China, whose growing middle-class
defaultes are fuelling a demand for English-language 
defaultprogrammes
default. 
default&#xa0;
default24.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt is important to make clear that the 
defaultindie 
defaultradio sector 
defaultis not simply 
defaultlooking at TV and saying ‘me too’ – it is 
defaultmore to make the case 
defaultthat there are more similarities than differences with TV
default,
default and the same 
defaultinterventions 
defaultcould be very effective in growing the UK’s indie radio production sector. The BBC has sought to argue, including to members of the Select Committee during its inquiry into ‘Supporting the Creative Economy’, that radio is a ‘dif
defaultferent market’ and can
defaultno
defaultt be treated in same way
default. However the fact that there are no other real sources for PSB radio than the BBC 
defaultsurely 
defaultmeans 
defaultthe Corporation 
defaulthas an even greater responsibility to make use of the benefits which working with indie radio c
defaultompanies can bring to the listener.
default&#xa0;
default25.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThere is no reason why indie productions
default could not contribute to any part 
defaulto
defaultf
default the BBC’s schedule. In fact this is more the case with the BBC than commercial radio, the latter having some 
defaultprogramming
default which is based around stra
defaulti
defaultghtforw
defaulta
defaultrd music play and advertising and sponsorship. But even BBC music shows are individual 
defaultprogrammes
default, with a dedicated production team and unique built-in features
default. 
defaultAnd 
defaultsuch s
defaulthows are already made, but only in a minority of
default cases, by indies, for example 
defaultSmooth Operations
default’ 
default‘
defaultRadcliffe and Maconie
default’
default 
defaultprogramme 
defaulton BBC 6Music.
default&#xa0;
defaultVoices From Across the UKdefault&#xa0;
default26.
default&#xa0; 
defaultDuring its evidence session on the BBC Annual Report in November 2013, the committee raised issues of making sure voices, stories
default and perspectives from across the UK are fully represented on the BBC. Clearly one way of making this happen is to have the content on the BBC’s services, including radio, commissioned from a wide range of production companies all around Britain. The map s
defaultupplied in Appendix 1 shows how the BBC has a few large production centres, but that there is a much more extensive network of indie radio /audio production companies.
default&#xa0;
default27.
default&#xa0; 
defaultRIG members have welcomed out-of-London initiatives such as the Salford Media City, whi
defaultlst recognising that it 
defaultdoes not 
defaultaddress the issue of how the BBC engages more with the creative sector across all UK, not just where it has regional centres of production.
default&#xa0;
defaultBBC Trustdefault 
default&#xa0;
default28.
default&#xa0; 
defaultRIG has had regular dialogue with the BBC 
defaultTrust 
defaultsince 2010, when it en
defaultgaged with the Trust on its Radio Network Supply Review.
default&#xa0;
default29.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhilst the sector did gain from the 2010 review, the experience nevertheless indicated that the lines between the BBC Executive and Trust appeared to be insufficiently drawn, with the Trust reluctan
defaultt to go as far as many had expected and also holding back from arguing for a quota by value, despite the wording of the BBC Agreement which mentions the value of commissions as an indicator of whether or not a true diversity of content is being commissione
defaultd from the indie sector.
default&#xa0;
default30.
default&#xa0; 
defaultOverall, from dealing with the Trust, RIG has the perception that members of the BBC Executive are well-qualified and appear to be diligent in their roles. Institutionally, however, it is still questionable whether the Trust can r
defaulteally be even-handed with external and internal stakeholders when one considers its dual regulatory / ‘cheerleader’ role which still exists. Seemingly small details such as the Trust sharing the same e-mail system as the BBC Executive point to a possibly g
defaultreater problem of the Trust remaining too close to the organisation it is supposed to regulate.
default&#xa0;
defaultLooking to the Futuredefault&#xa0;default31.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn looking forward to the next Charter it is important to take stock of the broadcasting world and what kind of PSB broadcasters we 
defaultneed, specifically what the BBC’s role should be.
default&#xa0;
default32.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhilst TV channels have proliferated, RIG is nevertheless of the opinion that a large-scale service which is not dependent on advertising remains important. Having the distinct licence fee model ensures th
defaultat whatever happens elsewhere in the sector UK audiences and citizens have an independent, objective and comprehensive news service, along with a wide range of other services.
default&#xa0;
default33.
default&#xa0; 
defaultHowever what has changed is improved technology, introducing the ability for co
defaultntent to be made far more easily and in many more locations 
defaultthan 
defaultwas the case when the BBC was first set up. There is no reason why in this day and age the vast majority of the BBC’s content cannot be made all around the country
default and, 
defaultwhilst it is impractic
defaultal for the BBC to have its own centres of production in many locations
default,
default it is not so difficult for a
defaultn independent
default production company to set up more or less where it wishes. This is the case even more with audio than it is with other forms of production. 
default&#xa0;
default34.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt could be argued that many of the serious problems the BBC has faced in recent years have been
default,
default in one way or another
default,
default the result of its being such a large institution. The solution is a firm new direction for the BBC, via the Charter, to make itself mor
defaulte fleet-of-foot, more flexible and more able to adapt to the challenges that will continue and develop over the period of the next Charter.
default&#xa0;
default35.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhilst 
defaultthe BBC Trust’s conclusions in its 2010 radio supply review
default were welcome, it failed to establish 
defaulta clear tim
defaultetable for achieving its objective of ‘the best ideas regardless of source’. This means that listeners are being deprived of the benefits of competition for the best programme ideas.  It also makes it difficult for most indies to invest in their companies 
defaulton anything but a short-term basis
default&#xa0;
default36.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhilst RIG was recently able to agree terms of trade which will mean more BBC-commissioned indie content is available online, with a fair return to indie producers, this is of limited value to both the audience and the i
defaultndustry if the latter is not given more access to BBC 
defaultprogrammes
default.
default&#xa0;
default37.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn his keynote speech in October 2013, BBC Director General Tony Hall stated that “the BBC must be the risk capital for the UK’s creative industries“
default and RIG has welcomed this. 
defaultUltimately 
defaultwe would like to see a position where most if not all non-news BBC Radio content was open to competition for ideas from indie 
defaultproduction companies. The TV example demonstrates the type of steps that can be taken to move towards such an aim.
default&#xa0;
default38.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe success of
default the TV model has shown a clear path and RIG has been asking for parity – namely a 25% quota 
defaultand
default 25% WoCC for BBC Radio commissioning. Opening up the BBC’s commissioning on such a scale would allow existing companies to grow and new entrants to market – bu
defaultt always on the basis that they could come up with innovation ideas, exciting talent and fresh stories to tell.
default&#xa0;
default39.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe would of course recommend that such a model was phased in 
defaultwithin a short number of years, rather than implemented in one go, 
defaultto prevent unne
defaultcessary cost and upheaval for the BBC in terms of re-organising its in-house operation to allow for a lower future output.
default 
defaultAll the evidence from TV suggests that o
defaultnce 
defaultthis change ha
defaults
default been 
defaultachieved
default, the Licence Fee Payer 
defaultcan 
defaultbe more certain of being given 
defaultcontent which had been through a competitive process to determine that it was among the best available.
