defaultExecutive Summary default&#xa0;
default1.1.
default              
defaultCoeliac
default disease is a long term, autoimmune condition triggered by intolerance to gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye and barley. Around 1 in 100 people in the UK are affected, although only 10-15% of those with the condition are diagnosed. 
default1.2.
default              
defaultCoeliac
default disease is not ‘curable’; the only treatment is adherence to a strict gluten-free diet.
default 
defaultThere is no medical intervention or alternative treatment programme. Without proper management, 
defaultcoeliac
default disease can lead to a greater incidence of chronic conditions including osteoporosis and cancer, placing unnecessary strain on health services. 
default1.3.
default              
defaultManagement of 
defaultcoeliac
default disease can be delivered effectively in the community; with areas of England pioneering pharmacy led prescribing schemes that reduce the impact on primary and secondary care. 
default1.4.
default              
defaultA clearer patient pathway and earlier diagnosis would speed up the proper management of 
defaultcoeliac
default disease and reduce the health complications associated with it. 
default1.5.
default              
defaultCoeliac
default UK, the national charity working for people with 
defaultcoeliac
default disease, have developed national guidelines for the prescribing of gluten-free foods exist recommending basic unit allowances and appropriate staple products for prescription such as fresh bread and pasta. However, contrary to these guidelines, restrictions to the basic unit allowance as well as types of staple products prescribed have been imposed in various parts of the country. Those with 
defaultcoeliac
default disease greatly value the provision of gluten-free foods on prescription and have strongly indicated their opposition to unfair restrictions or barriers to access. 
default1.6.
default              
defaultThe BSNA believes that the provision of an essential gluten-free prescription provides good value, fosters good dietary adherence, and, in the long-term, will help save the NHS money. 
default&#xa0;
default2.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCoeliac
default disease is an autoimmune disease which affects 1 in 100 people in the UK. For people with the condition, the consumption of gluten triggers an immune reaction, making the body attack itself. Eating gluten damages the lining of the small intestine and affects 
defaulta patients’ 
defaultability to 
defaultabsorb nutrients from
default food properly
default. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCoeliac disease is a life-long condition
default, the only treatment for which is adherence to a strict
default gluten-free diet
default.
default 
defaultCoeliac disease requires on
default-
defaultgoing review and management.
default&#xa0;
default2.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCoeliac
default disease isn't an allergy or an intolerance to gluten. In cases of coeliac disease, the immune system mistakes substances found inside gluten as a threat to the body and attacks them.
default&#xa0;
default2.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDiagnosis times for coeliac 
defaultpatients 
defaultaverage
default around
default 
default13 years as symptoms are commonly mistaken for 
defaultother gastrointestinal disorders 
defaultsuch as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). 
defaultFor a diagnosis of
default coeliac disease
default to be confirmed
default,
default patients 
defaultneed to undergo a 
defaultsmall 
defaultintestinal biopsy
default, 
defaultalthough in certain instances children displaying symptoms can be put straight onto a gluten-free diet following blood tests.
default&#xa0;
default2.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe main health risks linked to untreated and poorly managed coeliac disease include deficiencies of essential nutrients, leading to conditions such as anaemia; osteoporosis and associated increased risk of fractures due to a lack of calcium; 
defaultit
default can lead to the development of bowel cancer and in women it can also cause infe
defaultrtility and adverse outcomes in 
defaultpregnancy
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe NICE 2009 guidelines state 
defaultthat “coeliac disease can be very effectively treated with a gluten-free diet
default. I
defaultt is important to identify people with the undiagnosed disease so as to provide satisfactory individual treatment and also to improve the overall health of the community.”
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default3.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is vital for people with coeliac disease to be able to access basic gluten-free foods, including fresh bread, on prescription. 
defaultAdhering to a strict gluten-free diet is the medically advised treatment for coeliac disease. Choice is not an option as deviation from the diet will have a direct effect on health and morbidity.

defaultational prescribing guidelines titled ‘Gluten-free prescribing: a revised guide 2011’
default which provides information on the recommended amounts and type of products available to coeliac patients on prescription was produced by the NHS and endorsed by Coeliac UK, the Primary Care Society of Gastroenterology and the British Dietetic Association.
default 
defaultIt highlights the importance of adherence to a gluten-free diet in order to minimise the 
defaultrisk of 
defaultassociated complications and reflects current guidance on the prescribing of gluten-free foods
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSpecialist gluten-free foods have been developed and made available on prescription to replace everyday starchy foods such as breads, flour, pasta and cereals.
default Prescription gluten-free food products
default are 
defaultapproved by the Department of Health’s Advisory Committee on Borderline Substances (ACBS). Only essential gluten-free foods which contribute to a healthy balanced diet are approved for availability on prescription.
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPrescription gluten-free products are specifically selected to
default provide a guaranteed supply of essential staple 
defaultfoods, which should provide around
default 15% of 
defaultpati
defaultents’ energy requirements. 
default&#xa0;
default3.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPatients can purchase 
defaultgluten-
defaultfree products including pastas and flour in 
defaultcertain 
defaultlarger supermarkets
default however these are often priced 
defaultsignificantly higher
default than gluten-containing 
defaultalternatives. This 
defaultcost disproportionately affects
default people on lower incomes and those who live in more rural areas with 
defaultlittle or 
defaultno access to larger stores.
default&#xa0;
default3.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe social and psychological impact of sticking to a li
defaultfe-long gluten-free diet is significant 
defaultand
default,
default if managed inappropriately
default,
default may result in further hidden costs to the NHS including repeated visits to the GP, further investigations and related prescription costs. 
default&#xa0;
default3.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe annual ingredient cost in England of the 2012 provision of ACBS approved gluten-free foods was approximately £26.8 million Prescription Cost Analysis England 2012
default, NHS 
defaultInformation Centre, April 2013. Since the net ingredient cost for all prescriptions in England was £8.53 billion, gluten-free foods comprise only 0.31% of the total net ingredient cost for all prescribed products
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRestrictions have been
default introduced 
defaultby a number of Clinical Commissioning Groups
default (and formerly PCTs) 
defaulton cost rather than clinical grounds and run 
defaultcontrary to national guidance
default 
default(as discussed above) 
defaultdeveloped by 
defaultthe patient group Coeliac UK. The Government
default publically stated support for 
defaultcoeliacs
default to have access to such products on the NHS.
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe decision to withdraw patient access to a staple gluten-free food such as fresh bread conflicts with national guidance developed by the patients’ organisation Coeliac UK, as well as the Government’s publically stated support for 
defaultcoeliacs
default to access such staple products on prescription.
default&#xa0;
default4.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWithin the new NHS, CCGs should operate on a level playing field 
defaultto 
defaultprovide access to essential staple gluten-free foods such as bread and flour on prescription, to allow those with coeliac disease to successfu
defaultlly manage their own condition. 
default&#xa0;
default4.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe transition to CCGs has made it more difficult to understand the policies being operated in different areas in the UK. 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default5.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultResponding to a recent BSNA survey, over e
defaultight in ten (86%) 
defaultpeople 
defaultwith coeliac disease 
defaultagreed that accessing gluten free foods on prescription was important 
defaultin aiding adherence to a gluten-
defaultfree diet. 
defaultThe survey
default indicated that the poorest rely more heavily on
default prescriptions to manage their condition, and appeared to have fewer options available to them.
default&#xa0;
default5.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTwo-thirds 
defaultof those who had had their prescriptions limited or stopped reported a negative impact on their ability to manage their condition.
default 
defaultOne third of those surveyed said that cuts had made it more difficult for them to access gluten-free foods whether on prescription or in shops. 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default6.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultClinically led NHS services for the diagnosis and management of coeliac disease can be delivered through a variety of routes including the acute care setting, community pharmacy and primary care practices. 
default&#xa0;
default6.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFollowing diagnosis of coeliac disease or dermatitis 
defaultherpetiformis
default (DH), it is essential that referral is made to a dietitian for expert advice on following a gluten-free diet that is tailored to the individual.
default&#xa0;
default6.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCoeliac UK, the national c
defaultharity supporting people with coeliac disease, offers help and support to those diagnosed. It supports the m
defaultove towards increasing pharmacy-
defaultled prescribing schemes and encourages 
defaultthose diagnosed with 
defaultcoeliac disease to see 
defaultdieticians
default to 
defaulthelp 
defaultmanage their condition
default. 
defaultA
default dietitian can give individual advice and a step by step plan on how to remove gluten from the patient’s diet.
default&#xa0;default7.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRegular review is part of the foundation o
defaultf support for promoting good adherence
default to a gluten-free diet. 
defaultIntegrated care is also essential to the foundation of support. 
default&#xa0;default7.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNew more cost effective care pathways are currently being developed which will place primary care at the centre of on-going care for coeliac patients. 
default&#xa0;default7.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPublic Health England
default recently published its priorities for the year 2013
default–
default14 which included a commitment to ‘reducing the burden of disease’. Local Health and Wellbeing Boards are looking to focus on strategies which manage conditions and reduce the likelihood of future illness. Easy and widespread access to gluten-free food for coeliac patients is an example of this type of policy as it is the only way to help those with coeliac disease to overcome their symptoms
default and reduce the risk of associated long-term complications
default. The BSNA will look to work with Local Health and Wellbeing Boards to becoming good advocates for managing conditions.

defaultCoeliac UK has produced a toolkit

default&#xa0; 
defaultThrough the use of a pharmacy-led supply scheme

default, gluten-free foods are supplied directly from community pharmacists, thus
default minimising the workload for
