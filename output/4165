[normal]“[The BBC is] currently estimated to have around 7
[normal]0 per cent of all news consumption on both television and radio… The problem is when the BBC’s editorial voice speaks too much as one to the exclusion of others
[normal]… Coordination [of news output] can lead to homogeneity; and that can be intensified by regulati
[normal]on that sees there being ‘right and ‘wrong’ answers”.

[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]“A properly resourced service independent of the BBC could provide bracing competition and increase choice for audiences. There may be other i
[normal]deas across all media that should be given a go too”.

[normal]“The hard question for the corporation is why in a digital age it should have the whole pie to itself forever – when doing something different m

[normal]BBC Trust review of BBC One and BBC Two service licences[bold] (2010): 
[normal]“The clearest message audiences are sending us is that they want a more distinctive 
[normal]BBC One and BBC Two. The most significant gap between audience expectations and actual performance of BBC One and BBC Two arises in relation to their provision of programmes which ‘have lots of fresh and new ideas’
[normal].” 
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]“We believe BBC management should look
[normal] to increase the variety and range of pre-watershed programming on BBC One in order to ensure the channel makes a greater contribution to delivering the BBC’s public purposes by being more distinctive in peak time”
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]“The value for money of BBC One and BBC T
[normal]wo could be improved by better meeting audiences’ expectations for more distinctive programming” 
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]“We expect to see tangible and measurable actions that aim to address audience expectations better. We will monitor the outcomes of these actions primarily th
[normal]rough tracking whether audience perception that BBC One is delivering fresh and new ideas is improving”.
[normal]Putting Quality First[bold], Dec 2010, the Trust concluded: “
[normal]we would expect to see signs of improvement in audience perceptions by the end of 2011 and [we] 
[normal]will consider at that point whether we need to ask for further action from the Executive to address audience concerns
[normal]”
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Trust also said that ‘
[normal]distinctiveness is even more important in areas where there is a greater range of commercial competition… progr
[normal]amme and content commissioners should seek out distinctiveness – not just potential popularity
[normal]”
[normal]Lord Patten[bold], July 2011: “
[normal]an important part of the BBC’s role is to take creative risks… and produce distinctive content that the market cannot
[normal]”
[normal]David Liddiment[bold],
[normal] June 2012: “
[normal]We will continue to press BBC One to ‘take creative risks and innovate’ and to ‘regularly broadcast programmes of large scale and ambition’ in line with its service licence commitments
[normal]”
[normal]June 2012[bold] the Trust assessed delivery against the service
[normal] licence review requirements, and concluded that BBC’s One requirement to become more distinctive was simply ‘
[normal]ongoing
[normal]’ 
[normal]Lord Patten[bold], Jan 2012: “
[normal]For several years now the Trust has been encouraging the BBC to be more 'distinctive' in its programming, partic
[normal]ularly on the big mainstream television services. That means tapping into the spirit of the outsider, the interrogator of received wisdom. Another way of putting this is: we should be prepared to live more dangerously
