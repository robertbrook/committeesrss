"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by E3G (CCS33)1. Summary1.1\n              \nThe current UK approach to CCS is too narrowly focussed on electricity \ngeneration and the procurement of individual projects. This must be urgently supplemented by a view on what ultimate deployment of CCS could look like in a decarbonised economy, and the necessary practical actions that are required to enable this to be ach\nieved.\n1.2\n              \nThe Office of CCS within DECC is tied down in ‘delivery’ mode. While recognising that it is seeking to do a difficult task with \nreduced\n funding, it is failing to catalyse the parallel efforts in enabling infrastructure and industrial CCS require\nd to enable wider deployment and cost reduction. The OCCS is also responsible for fossil fuel \nstrategy\n, but CCS is insufficiently integrated into current policies – particularly the gas strategy and the prospects for continued use of coal. \n1.3\n              \nUK policy o\nn CCS appears to reflect a fear of being seen to be ‘picking winners’\n: the first UK competition picked a technology option and suffered for it. We would therefore agree that maintaining openness to different capture technologies should be continued. Howeve\nr it is imperative that a more proactive approach be taken to ‘pick geologies’ (for large-scale storage) and ‘pick geographies’ (for infrastructure investment).\n This will provide the largest benefits to the UK via cost reduction, the retention of industria\nl jobs and the development of exportable CCS engineering and integration expertise.\n1.4\n              \nPrevious UK leadership on CCS in Europe and internationally has been diminished over recent years. The UK needs to ensure that it secures funding from the second round \nof the NER300 mechanism, and should be taking a more proactive approach to EU policy discussions. The introduction of a CCS certificate system (or similar) could bring significant benefits for UK projects.\n2. About E3G and our engagement in CCS2.1 \n              \nE3G is\n an independent, non-profit organisation operating in the public interest to accelerate the global transition to sustainable development. E3G builds cross-sectoral coalitions to achieve carefully defined outcomes, chosen for their capacity to leverage chan\nge. E3G works closely with like-minded partners in government, politics, civil society, science, the media, public interest foundations and elsewhere. Further information is available at \nwww.e3g.org\n .\n2.2\n              \nE3G welcomes the\n ECC committee inquiry into CCS. E3G has been closely involved in UK, European and International efforts to accelerate action on CCS over the past decade, including the creation of the EU’s NER300 funding mechanism and the Near Zero Emission Coal (NZEC) pr\noject between the UK, EU and China.\n E3G is represented on the Advisory Council of the European Technology Platform for Zero \nEmission Fossil Fuel Power Plants (ZEP) and is a member of the International Environmental NGO network on CCS.\n2.3\n              \nE3G recognises th\nat it will be \ndifficult for \nthe international community to secure a global deal on climate unless key countries and constituencies \nfeel\n that they can maintain energy security while reducing emissions. In our view, the deployment of CCS is therefore both a \ntechnological necessity (as a stable climate will only be secured if we limit the \nstock\n of CO2 emissions in the atmosphere) and a political intervention that can shape the space for other actions and agreements.\n2.4\n              \nIn this submission, we look at three are\nas that we believe require additional attention from UK policy makers: \nWe will be pleased to provide additional evidence if requested.\n&#xa0;\n3. Context: why CCS? What should be prioritised?3.1\n              \nThe premise behind CCS is simple but stated\n with insufficient frequency or clarity. A continued growth in CO2 emissions to the atmosphere will result in an unstable climate and ocean acidification. This is related to the stock of CO2 in the atmosphere, not the rate of emissions in any particular ye\nar. \n3.2\n              \nTo adequately address this challenge, emissions of CO2 must not just be slowed – they must ultimately be stopped. Indeed, the forthcoming 5\nth\n Assessment Report of the IPCC is expected to highlight that \nnegative emissions will be required to operat\ne globally at large scale before 2050\n \nin addition to CCS on power plant and industry,\n \nin order t\no limit global climate warming to less than 2°C. Thus, CO2 needs to be removed from earth’s biosphere into \npermanent sequestration\n. \n3.3\n              \nThe technological challenge facing humanity is therefore to phase out the use of unabated fossil fuels, or, where this is not possible, to deploy CCS. \n3.4\n              \nCCS will be indispensable to mitigate emissions from processes where CO2 emissions are an integral p\nart of production (steel, cement, chemicals etc) and to enable negative emissions (via direct air capture or in combination with biomass) as a means of offsetting other sources of emissions that cannot be captured at source. \n3.5\n              \nCCS for electricity genera\ntion is different, in that it provides \njust \none option among others for the production of low-carbon electricity. CCS \ndoes however \noffer the \nprospect of flexible generation capacity that can be dispatched in support of a high Renewables grid. CCS will be p\narticularly valuable for locations with significant industrial production capacity, as it will be able to provide both low-carbon electricity and heat, and share the costs of CO2 transport and storage with other emitters. \n3.6\n              \nIt should therefore be noted \nthat the UK approach of seeking to enable cost-competitive deployment of CCS within the electricity generation sector seeks to address the CCS challenge from the opposite end of this set of problems. It posits that making CCS ‘available’ will then enable d\neployment via carbon prices. It fails to take a view on what is likely to be desirable as an end-state deployment of CCS within a low-carbon economy, nor on what enabling actions will be required to enable this widespread deployment to occur. The absence o\nf a proactive approach on CO2 transport and storage infrastructures and the e\nxclusion of industrial CCS are symptomatic of this approach. The USA has shown far greater ability to develop CCS projects by specifically focussing on these practical aspects of \nthe CCS challenge.\n3.\n7\n              \nIt should be noted here that the \nvalue\n of CCS is not the same as the \ncost\n of CCS per ton of CO2 captured or stored. The highest value for CCS in future will be for negative emissions that assist in climate stabilization. Next will be\n the value for job retention and maintained economic output for the economy from CCS on industrial production. The valuation of CCS on power generation should subsequently be based on the cost of CCS when measured against clean power produced, not by tons \nof CO2. This would indicate that CCS on natural gas is preferable to CCS on coal or lignite, as it has half the CO2 volume.\n3.8\n              \nAcross Europe, the potential for CCS on gas has been regrettably overlooked in favour of coal and lignite, due to the centrality\n of emissions trading as the favoured policy instrument and the assumption that CCS should be deployed first on lignite, then coal due to higher carbon costs. On this logic, CCS would only be deployed on gas if the cost of carbon reaches over €100/ton, wit\nh CCS on industry a long-way down the line (due to higher costs per ton due to lower CO2 volumes). The UK \nCommercialisation Programme has addressed this by\n valuing CCS for electricity generation on the basis of \nelectricity \noutput rather than per ton of CO2\n, but has failed to apply this same logic to the industrial sector.\n3.\n9\n              \nThe \nprioritisation\n of CCS on gas-fired electricity generation rather than coal is also desirable when considering global emissions limits. CCS on gas offers the prospect of a potential\nly near closed life-cycle loop from production of gas through processing and combustion and back to storage of CO2. A similar life-cycle for coal will at best be able to reduce emissions by around 70%. Gas production typically has a lower local environment\nal impact than coal production, as does its combustion. Natural gas has fewer impurities, aiding the carbon capture process, while the smaller volumes of CO2 produced per clean MW generated present half the requirement for CO2 transportation and storage. \n3.\n10\n              \nThis is of particular relevance when considering the availability of CO2 storage. While there is a large theoretical volume of CO2 storage accessible, the current practical reality is that it is a scarce asset. Access to CO2 storage should therefore b\ne prioritized for the highest value applications, not taken up by low-value high-CO2 sources.\n3.11\n              \nIn the context of the impact of shale gas extraction on US energy prices, t\nhere is great strategic value in advancing the deployment of CCS on gas power gene\nration.\n A shift from coal to gas reduces emissions significantly, but only with the deployment of CCS would gas have a longer-term sustainable role in the UK or Europe.\n3.12\n              \nWith the Peterhead project one of the remaining two projects in the UK Commerciali\nsation Programme, the UK is well-placed to reap the rewards – but current policy \nas set out in the gas strategy and in the proposals for Emissions Performance Standards \nbizarrely seeks to remove new waves of gas plant from the need to consider the deployme\nnt or retrofit of CCS.\n \n3.13\n              \nThe UK should instead be setting out a pathway for the retrofit and or deployment of CCS on gas-fired generation from the outset as a means of providing investors with a clearer business case out to 2030 and beyond. At present \nthe position of exempting gas plants from the EPS out to 2045 is incoherent in the context of carbon budgets and the assumption that carbon prices will rise to restrict running hours and / or incentivise CCS.\n \n3.14\n              \nThe\nre is a\n need for greater clarity of pu\nrpose in government policy to restate the necessary shift from unabated fossil fuels to the widespread deployment of CCS over the coming decades.\n Given that the Office of CCS is also responsible for policy on fossil fuels, more should have been expected on\n this over recent years. Instead, DECC has appeared to be seeking to extend the lifetime of old coal plant and encourage new unabated gas (in the face of continued pressure from HM Treasury). Prospects for CCS have been overlooked rather than positioned at\n the centre of HM Government strategy on fossil fuels.\n3.15\n              \nSimilarly, the application of CCS to industrial facilities was only weakly featured in the CCS Roadmap. BIS have recently commissioned analysis on costs, but no clear forward strategy has been ide\nntified. The OCCS, meanwhile, has declined to take a proactive role in supporting potential industrial CCS projects as it concentrates on the Commercialisation Programme for electricity generation projects. We are aware of at least one project that could b\ne taken forward rapidly but which seemingly cannot be supported by the UK government due to it not being linked to electricity generation.\n3.16\n              \nWhile the desire of DECC / OCCS to ensure successful ‘delivery’ after past failures is understandable, the curre\nnt narrow approach is setting back chances of securing the timely and widespread deployment of CCS in the UK. \n&#xa0;4. CCS availability, cost reduction and UK benefits4.1\n              \nA range of technologies for CO2 capture are already available, some of which have many \ndecades of commercial application (see for example, the separation of CO2 in gas processing facilities or ammonia production). CO2 transport and storage have also been deployed at commercial scale, particularly when in combination with Enhanced Oil Recover\ny (CO2-EOR) in North America.\n4.2\n              \nContinued innovation and cost reduction of capture technologies is possible, and will be accelerated by the development of global markets for CCS. The UK will benefit from the development of such markets in a limited way v\nia the presence of manufacturing facilities for the major technology companies.\n4.3\n              \nMore importantly, the major initial cost reductions for CCS projects will come from inescapably ‘local’ issues regarding accessibility of CO2 storage and the provision of C\nO2 transport infrastructure. \nT\nhe findings of the UK’s CCS Cost Reduction Taskforce point to the centrality of risk reduction and economies of scale as a means of reducing project cost and enabling commercial deployment.\n4.4\n              \nIt must be remembered that ‘CCS’\n is in fact a integrated set of technologies more akin to the infrastructure associated with oil and gas production, processing and distribution, and not a simple bolt-on pollution control instrument. CCS policy therefore needs to consider network solution\ns for CCS, not simply point-to-point project investment models. We will return to this failing of UK policy making below.\n4.5\n              \nSome policy makers (including HM Treasury) have queried why the UK should invest in CCS now, rather than waiting for cost reductio\nns to occur elsewhere first. The answer lies in the inevitably local nature of CCS deployment. While it may of course be possible to import cheaper CO2 capture technology in future ‘from China’ (to take a frequent example), it is \nnot \npossible to import geo\nlogy, nor local geographies for transportation infrastructure. Nor is it possible to radically alter the timetables of current North Sea oil and gas fields experiencing declining production and which would be amenable for use for CO2 storage (either in com\nbination with CO2-EOR or post-production). \n4.6\n              \nNeither is it possible to avoid the timetables of investment cycles for existing UK industrial production facilities. The logic of carbon pricing is that CO2 will increasingly be considered as a component par\nt of production costs (in addition to the carbon cost of electricity generation), and the pursuit of low-carbon competitiveness will therefore require attention to decarbonise production itself, or face the risk of production capacity re-locating overseas \nin pursuit of lower costs (e.g. of labour) or where more efficient and lower-emitting plant can be built from scratch. In such a context, the deployment and retrofit of CCS becomes a critical job retention technology for industrial sectors in the UK and Eu\nrope including \noil refineries, paper works, steelworks, \nand \ncement production.\n4.7\n              \nThe most significant competitive advantage and economic benefit to the UK from continued and accelerated investment in CCS will therefore be two-fold. Firstly, by enabling t\nhe decarbonisation of industrial production and associated electricity generation in ways that add value and reduce system costs overall. Secondly, by providing a home market within which the UK’s engineering expertise can address CCS infrastructure integr\nation challenges, positioning it ready to export this valuable skills and know-how, just as has been achieved by the offshore oil and gas sector.\n&#xa0;\n5. UK and EU misaligned on projects and policy5\n.1 \n              \nThe UK’s reputation as a policy innovator and political a\ndvocate for CCS has been progressively diminished over recent years.\n \nThe UK should be at the forefront of efforts to improve the CCS policy framework within Europe and globally, both of which would be of immediate practical benefit to the UK. The current a\nbsence of proactive engagement on either is resulting in the UK losing its reputation as a leading advocate of CCS.\n5.2\n              \n As the member state best positioned for the deployment of CCS within Europe, the UK’s successes and failures are closely watched by oth\ners. Getting it right in the UK matters if CCS is to be deployed more widely in Europe.\n The stripping back of UK financial support for domestic CCS programmes has negatively impacted on practical momentum, while the de-prioritisation of international CCS e\nfforts has contributed to the hollowing out of previous strategic efforts and forums such as the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum and Clean Energy Ministerial.\n5\n.3\n              \nOn \nprojects, t\nhe failure to secure EU funding from the first round of the NER300 progra\nmme was an immense embarrassment, given the leading role the UK played in securing its creation (and delaying its implementation).\n \n5.4\n              \nThe previous Labour government enacted a CCS levy in Energy Act 2010, stated a commitment to supporting 4 CCS projects, \nand introduced a policy of ‘no new coal without CCS’. The coalition government in turn initially expressed its intent to make the UK “first choice for investment in CCS”, before rejecting the CCS levy in favour of the Treasury’s Carbon Price Support mechan\nism, and quietly dropping the commitment to 4 projects.\n5.5\n              \nIn the interim, the creation of the EU’s NER300 funding mechanism in 2008-09 enabled multiple UK CCS projects to continue development. In 2010-11 the UK was able to put forward 7 CCS projects for \nconsideration (out of 13 in total from across the EU). \n5.6\n              \nThis positive situation was belatedly complemented by the launch of the UK’s current CCS commercialization programme in early 2012. This again received a number of interesting expressions of inter\nest (including in ‘part-chain’ industrial and \ninfrastructure projects), however only 5 full-chain projects subsequently entered the UK programme – 4 of which were still in the running for NER300 funding.\n5.7\n              \nUnfortunately, the UK was unable to confirm a su\nfficiently specific selection of projects or the provision of co-funding in time, and the first round of NER300 closed in December 2012 with funding allocated to 23 renewables projects (2 in the UK), but no CCS projects. The only firm choice taken by the U\nK was to de-select the Don Valley project, which had already received €180m from the EU’s EEPR fund, and which had been top ranked by the European Investment Bank scrutiny process.\n5.8\n              \nMore recently, the final 4 projects in the UK competition have been whi\nttled down to 2 preferred projects and 2 reserve projects. \nAll 4 of these projects (and indeed the Don Valley project too) are high quality projects that are located in strategic locations that could set the UK on track for the development of a core CO2 in\nfrastructure to enable wider decarbonisation. Yet only with the announcement of preferred projects did DECC belatedly try to find ways of supporting the continued development of the other projects. This has been too little, too late.\n5.9\n              \nThe preferred proj\nects at Peterhead (Gas post-combustion retrofit, Shell and SSE) and White Rose (Coal oxyfuel new build, Alstom, Drax, BOC and National Grid) are set to undertake further detailed Front End Engineering and Design studies, due for completion in mid-2014. Fur\nther negotiations would then be undertaken with DECC before project award, with a final decision not expected until early 2015. \nThis is too slow, and the current approach is a recipe for the period 2010-2015 being seen to be five wasted years for CCS in th\ne UK.\n5.10\n              \nThe White Rose project is the sole CCS entrant in the second round of the EU NER300 process, and should therefore be guaranteed additional funding support – provided that the UK government is able to provide sufficient clarity to the European Co\nmmission as to its willingness to provide its own funding support. Given previous failures it is imperative that the UK is in a position to take timely decisions on co-funding support. We acknowledge that the level of funding to come from the NER300 is an \norder of magnitude lower, however the principle of a pan-European effort on CCS was one that the UK advocated and should still be seeking to support. The failure of the second round of NER300 would have negative implications for the inclusion of CCS within\n any similar future funding mechanism, as may be included under efforts to reform the EU ETS.\n5.11\n              \nGiven that gas CCS projects are disadvantaged by the EU assessment criteria, the Peterhead project has sensibly decided not to bid for NER300 funding. This h\nas had the positive impact of removing a potential point of indecision from DECC, which would otherwise have had to choose between 2 UK projects for its sole remaining funding slot.\n \n5.12\n              \nOn \npolicy, t\nhe recently published UK response to the European Commission consultation on CCS failed to take a proactive approach, and failed to support \nemerging policy options (such as CCS certificates) that could advance CCS \non industrial sources of CO2 \nand unlock th\ne potential of the North Sea as a hub for European CO2 storage. \nThe UK paper instead repeated the unhelpful \nand simplistic \nposition that CCS certificates would require some form of technology target, and would therefore not be supported. This approach is d\namaging to the UK’s diplomatic efforts on EU climate policy more broadly, not simply on CCS.\n5.\n13\n              \nMoreover, it is being increasingly recognised elsewhere in Europe that additional policy measures will be required (at both EU and member state level) to enab\nle the deployment of CCS. The UK should be at the forefront of efforts to accelerate this, but instead has retreated into a limited focus on its own Commercialisation Programme and Electricity Market Reform efforts. \n5.14\n              \nThe UK should, for example, be con\nsidering how its proposed Emissions Performance Standard could be improved \nthrough the\n integrat\nion of CO2 limits on existing plant in line \nEU timetables for\n investment decisions on pollution control equipment. Such an effort would accelerate EU efforts to address the continued operation of existing coal plant, as per the recommendation of the IEA that additional policy measures beyond carbon pricing must be c\nonsidered.\n5.15\n              \nSimilarly, the UK has much to gain from any enhanced funding mechanisms for the development of CO2 infrastructure, storage characterisation and industrial CCS. A combined CCS certificate / infrastructure fund could supplement limited UK fun\nding and provide additional revenue streams for UK projects. Such options should be proactively considered now so that CCS can be positioned as a coherent element of a future EU climate and energy framework out to 2030 and beyond.\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
