defaultTHE HCPC REFUSE
defaultD
default TO INVESTIGATE LEGITIMATE COMPLAINTS: 
default&#xa0;
default5 July 2012: I submitted
default 
defaulta 
defaultproperl
defaulty completed complaint form
default by email to the HPC’s email address (
defaultftp@hpc-uk.org
default) for Fitness to Practice cases. 
defaultThe HPC, thence the 
defaultHCPC
default,
default never acknowledged my submission.
default&#xa0;
defaultI have copied below the complaint, unedited, from the complaint form.

default“
defaultDeacon is a registered social worker and nurse who took money from my ex-wife to write a defamatory document (dated 24 February 2008) that accused me of the disgusting crimes of “both spousal and child abuse” and recommended that I should be criminally pro
defaultsecuted, based on nothing but malicious hearsay and biases, without contacting me or any other witnesses or admitting my ex-wife’s motivations or incredibility. 
default&#xa0;
defaultDeacon’s document is not a court document
default default– it is not even marked as confidential. It 
defaultspecifies no intended recipients or destination. She does not address the report to anybody or specify who asked for the report: “I have been asked to write a report on my work with the above child.” She was asked by my ex-wife alone, who paid for it. She 
defaultattempted (23 March 2008) to admit this report into family court during a dispute about property, but the court ruled it as inadmissible, yet it was used to defame me outside of court. No child was at issue in court. No court ever has requested or admitted
default this report. Deacon and my ex-wife contacted no criminal authorities. They used this report to slander me and for material gain during a dispute about property.
default              
defaultDeacon’s document is defamation by a self-identified carer exploiting her qualifications as 
defaulta 
defaultcarer
default. Deacon’s report began with a list of all her credentials, followed by a description: “I am a qualified psychiatric nurse, a qualified Deacon and a qualified practice teacher in social work.” (This document is attached.)
default&#xa0;
defaultI struggled for two years 
defaultin family court with my ex-wife raising new false issues like this (the judgment condemned her for 
defaulttortious
default interference, breaches of trust, and incredible evidence). After completing family court, I complained about Deacon (Deacon was never an issue in fa
defaultmily court), but Deacon interfered with my complaints. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn her 
defaultcommunications, Deacon contradicted herself and lied about her actions:
defaultHer email contains 
defaultlies about supposed attempts to contact medefault. In her email to me she claimed that she had tried to
default investigate my side of the story, that she tried to contact me during her investigation but found my “whereabouts unknown”. Yet she contradicts herself in the next sentence when she claimed that she had tried to contact me at my employer. Every one of my 
defaultemployers has maintained a web page in the public domain with my profile and full contact details. She claims to have tried to contact me at 
defaultCranfield
default University around the time that she compiled and signed her report in February 2008, but I was not employ
defaulted by 
defaultCranfield
default University until April 2008. She claimed that her emails to me on my employer’s email server were returned, but nobody else had any trouble with that server, including my ex-wife, who defamed me to 
defaultCranfield
default in June 2008. If any email had b
defaultounced, she could have written to me at my employer’s postal address. In any case, I had other public profiles, most obviously on my own business’ website, with publically-accessible email address and postal address, and a dozen other public profiles, incl
defaultuding the 
defaultFacebook
default page through which she emailed me successfully in February 2010. She did not contact me in 2008 by any of a dozen available means.”
default&#xa0;
default10 July 2012: I submitted my complaint a second time
default but again
default HCPC never acknowledged it.
default&#xa0;
default12 July 2012: I complained to 
defaultfeedback@hpc-uk.org
default about the lack of response. Ruth Cooper, PA to the Director of Operations, replied the same day, stating that she had passed it on “to the relevant department.”
default&#xa0;
default17 
defaultJuly 2012: I emailed Ruth Cooper again complaining that I had heard nothing from anyone else at HCPC.
default&#xa0;
default18 July 2012: Ruth Cooper replied, apologising and again stating that she would contact the relevant department.
default&#xa0;
default10 August 2012: email from 
defaultAmita
default 
defaultMal
defaulthotra
default, Case Support Manager, re-allocating my complaint from 
defaultsome
default undeclared other category of case (MIS23597) to a Fitness to Practice case (FTP24607). I had always made a Fitness to Practice complaint
default (see 5 July 2012).
default&#xa0;
default15 August 2012: email from Joshua
default Carey (using 
defaultftp@hcpc-uk.org
default) reporting his finding “
defaultthat it appears that on 11 February 2010 the GSCC emailed you advising that it was not prepared to further investigate your concerns” and “that it is not the respo
defaultnsibility of the Health and Care Professions Council to reinvestigate complaints which were previously raised with the GSCC for which you may not have been happy with the decision.” He asked me to “advise us if you consider that this matter has not previou
defaultsly been investigated by the GSCC.” I did so by email the same day, for which I received no acknowledgement from the HCPC.
default&#xa0;
default25 August 2012: I emailed to 
defaultftp@hcpc-uk.org
default, reminding the HCPC that I was awaiting a respon
defaultse.
default&#xa0;
default30 August 2012: I emailed to 
defaultftp@hcpc-uk.org
default, asking for a response and warning that I would complain to the Ombudsman if I were to receive no response within 7 days.
default&#xa0;
default3 September 2012: I emailed Ruth Cooper, PA 
defaultto the Director of Operations, warning her of the deadline.
default&#xa0;
default4 September 2012: Ruth Cooper emailed to say that she had contacted the FTP department
default and would contact me again if she heard anything
default.
default 
defaultI heard nothing further from HCPC.
