defaultQ57 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultThe Chairman:default Good afternoon.
default 
defaultI think you were sitting at the back listening and you will pretty well know ho
defaultw these things proceed.
default 
defaultYou are extremely welcome here, first of all, Mr Parker, from
default the NFU, and Mr Hale and Mr Kr
defaultó
defaultl from the Alternative Investment Management Association.
default 
defaultThe questions will be pretty obvious.
default 
defaultSome are directed to the NFU and some to you, but if you feel that you have something to contribute to the answers, please come in and say so; on the other hand, if you agree with what is being said, I do not think there is any point in saying it a second or third time.
defaultWe will start.
default 
defaultI will ask the first question, and I will ask the Lord Wrigglesworth to ask the second question.
default 
defaultThis one is quite clearly to Mr Parker, originally: could you give us an overview of why businesses are set up as partnerships in the agricultural sector?
default 
defaultWhat types of partnerships are used and what are the implications for the sector of the clauses in the draft Finance Bill?
defaultMichael Parkerdefault: By way of background, in excess of 90% of farm businesses are unincorporated.
default 
defaultProbably in the region of 40% trade through a partnership.
default 
defaultPrimarily, that is through a general partnership.
default 
defaultThere is very little use of LLPs in our industry.
default 
defaultThe partnership structure is a particularly suitable one for farming businesses, which tend to be family businesses, often intergenerational and with several generations included within the same partnership.
default 
defaultIt is quite a simple structure to operate through.
default 
defaultThere is less formality compared to a limited company and it probably provides greater flexibility in terms of rewarding different partners for their changing contributions to the partnership over a long career.
default 
defaultAlso, perhaps some of the benefits of limited companies are not necessarily relevant.
default 
defaultThey are not necessarily looking to offer equity to external investors and there may be limited need for a limited liability.
default 
defaultThere are some mixed partnerships, as I think has been alluded to in earlier evidence from other people.
default 
defaultOften, that is for a commercial reason or an historic reason; some of these have existed for many years.
default 
defaultIn some cases, there are land-tenure issues as to why you would not fully incorporate a business.
default 
defaultThat is pretty much my overview.
defaultThe Chairman:default What is the effect of the draft clauses in the Finance Bill on the agricultural sector?
defaultMichael Parkerdefault: It is primarily the mixed-partnership legislation that could have an impact.
default 
defaultIt is really dependent on how the legislation is interpreted.
default 
defaultWe have gone from original proposals, which seemed to have a motive test that one of the main reasons for the business structure was tax avoidance, to something which is more around whether it is reasonable to assume that a tax advantage has been arrived at.
default 
defaultIt really depends upon how the legislation is interpreted on mixed partnerships.
defaultThe Chairman:default Can you give examples of where you think the proposals would be damaging to agriculture?
defaultMichael Parkerdefault: It creates uncertainty.
default 
defaultIf you have a mixed partnership with a corporate partner in it, you are potentially within the legislation.
default 
defaultYou will have to justify what the corporate member is doing in return for the profit allocation, and that leaves you open to having to incur costs and advice, and justifying that, even in purely commercial arrangements.
defaultQ58 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Wrigglesworth:default Do you accept that structures involving partnerships in businesses are being used for tax-avoidance purposes?
default 
defaultHow should the Government attack tax avoidance if some structures are being used for that purpose?
defaultMichael Parkerdefault: Yes, I accept that there are some that will be using this business structure in that way.
default 
defaultIt depends a little on how you define tax avoidance: whether you define that as lost tax or whether you include deferral of tax on profits.
default 
defaultThere has been mention of some businesses seeking to retain profits for working capital and there has also been talk about disparity between income tax rates and corporation tax rates.
default 
defaultIt rather depends on what we are talking about there.
default 
defaultIf we are talking about tax lost, I would perfectly agree with that.
default 
defaultUnfortunately, this legislation includes even deferral, where there is not going to be tax loss because, when the profits are extracted, higher-rate tax will be due.
default 
defaultThere is a potential issue there.
defaultLord Wrigglesworth:default Do you think that the current proposals are weighted too much towards counter-avoidance and do not pay enough care and attention to the business case for it?
defaultMichael Parkerdefault: They are fairly widely drawn, so that they do, perhaps, have the potential to limit a business’s ability to retain and invest profits.
default 
defaultWe have seen the gap between corporation tax and income tax rates widen.
default 
defaultWe have seen, certainly in farming, agricultural buildings allowances abolished and we have seen reductions in capital allowances, and farming is particularly capital intensive, which makes it far more difficult to continue to invest at the same level.
default 
defaultThat is not to say that that is the reason why the majority of mixed partnerships exist in farming.
default 
defaultThe majority are commercially driven and historic where land ownership has been fragmented, or land tenure, in some cases.
defaultQ59 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultBaroness Drake:default I come to the issue of the tests proposed in the draft legislation for determining whether partnership profits or losses can be reallocated by the HMRC.
default 
defaultMr Parker, starting with you, the farmers’ group submission stated that the proposed tests are extremely subjective and, as a result, are not well targeted.
default 
defaultPerhaps you could elaborate on why you think they are not sufficiently targeted.
defaultMichael Parkerdefault: The original statement seemed to suggest that it would not affect businesses where the driver for the structure was commercial.
default 
defaultIt potentially does now or, at the very least, it will mean you have to justify what the corporate partner’s role in the business is and whether the profit that it receives is commensurate with what it brings to the partnership.
defaultBaroness Drake:default There are four specific criteria, but are they equally untargeted in your view or are there particular ones within those four?
defaultMichael Parkerdefault: I would have preferred to have seen a tax-motive test as the first thing as to whether the legislation should apply to the business.
default 
defaultThat is one of the main issues, because it brings uncertainty.
default 
defaultAs I said, in the majority of cases, the profit share would be justified, but it is potentially going to be necessary to do that.
defaultBaroness Drake:default If the company’s share of the partnership profits 
defaultis
default not excessive, will they not be safe?
defaultMichael Parkerdefault: Yes, it would only be if they were judged to be excessive.
default 
defaultThat leaves quite a lot open to debate in terms of what a realistic return for that business is and what that business brings to the partnership.
defaultBaroness Drake:default Do other members of the panel want to comment on that particular provision?
defaultPaul Haledefault: The same issues are relevant to partnerships operating in a wide variety of businesses.
default 
defaultIn each case, there is going to be an issue in identifying whether the reward to the corporate member, which, on the face of it, in the legislation, is couched in terms of a return on money at interest equal to the amount of capital that the corporate entity is putting into the business, is excessive or not.
default 
defaultThere are going to be questions on what the appropriate rate of return is.
default 
defaultIt is introducing a lot of uncertainty into businesses where there is no excessive tax-avoidance motive.
default 
defaultThere may be what the Government clearly is trying to regard as some form of tax-avoidance motive, in that you try to accumulate working capital for the business in a form that attracts corporation tax at 20%-odd rather than personal income taxes.
default 
defaultYou can have a big debate over whether that is tax avoidance or acceptable tax mitigation.
defaultQ60 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Bilimoria:default Just following on from that, could you give us an overview of the role of partnerships in the sector that your association represents, Mr 
defaultKról
default and Mr Hale, and the relevance of the Finance Bill?
defaultPaul Haledefault: Would it be helpful if I just gave you a little bit of background about AIMA?
defaultLord Bilimoria:default Yes, please.
defaultPaul Haledefault: That will then lead into some of the questions, and certainly some of the ones that you were putting to the accountancy bodies earlier.
default 
defaultBy way of background, AIMA is the global trade association for the hedge fund industry.
default 
defaultIts role is to provide leadership to the industry and it represents all of the practitioners.
default 
defaultThat includes hedge fund managers, fund of hedge fund managers, prime brokers, legal and accounting firms, investors, fund administrators and independent fund directors.
default 
defaultWe have more than 1,400 corporate members in over 50 countries and are represented in all of the major financial centres globally.
default 
defaultManager members account for approximately $1.3 trillion, which is roughly 
default50% of the worldwide hedge fund industry’s assets under management.
default 
defaultThat is our global position.
default 
defaultOur members in the 
defaultUK
default represent about 28% of the entire membership, and we have currently 395 UK-based members.
default 
default67% of those—two thirds or about 260—are managers.
default 
defaultThey collectively manage somewhere between $500 billion and $700 billion of assets.
default 
defaultWe believe that about 60% of those 263 managers are established as LLPs, with perhaps a handful as a limited or general partnership, so this legislation is very relevant to our members.
defaultThere are some further background details, which I will give you very briefly, because they are definitely relevant to the matters you are considering.
default 
defaultThese managers carry on the business of investment managers; that is, they manage investments held by funds, the shares or interests in which are marketed to investors, or else they manage institutional managed accounts for insurance companie
defaults and pension funds et cetera
default.
default 
defaultThe managers do not, themselves, hold monies or assets, which is the role in the structure of prime brokers, depositaries or custodians, and the managers are not funds themselves.
default 
defaultThey are regulated by the FCA.
default 
defaultUnder the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive, which is coming into force, many, if not all, of these asset managers will be classed as alternative investment fund managers, and the funds they manage as alternative investment funds—these are often referred to by the lovely acronyms AIFMs and AIFs.
default 
defaultThis means that the managers will be potentially subject to the regime imposed under the AIFMD on variable remuneration, which will require that receipt of a significant proportion of variable remuneration must be deferred.
default 
defaultThat will be between 40% and 60% of variable remuneration—in most cases, we believe it will be 60%—with at least a three-year or up to a five-year, perhaps, deferral period.
default 
defaultHalf of all variable remuneration, whether received up front or deferred, will have to be received in the form of equity interests—in practice, equity in the fund—and that must be retained for at least six months.
defaultThe AIFMD is in the process of coming into effect but many managers are already operating similar deferment regimes for business reasons, not least because there are investor pressures.
default 
defaultEven if the managers are not required under the rules in the directive to operate this deferral regime, because they pass a series of proportionality tests, they may fall into other regimes under other directives or under voluntary arrangements, which will require them to operate these deferral arrangements.
defaultThe consequence is that, in these Finance Bill proposals, the parts that are of relevance to our members are those on the position of salaried members of LLPs, those which relate to the allocation of profits within partnerships with mixed membership, and, in particular, the provision that you were discussing earlier with the accountancy bodies, which relate to AIFM businesses.
default 
defaultThat part of the schedule is an easement—it is not a tax-raising provision at all—and is being developed with a considerable amount of input from our organisation to provide a solution to a problem that arises because of the AIFMD deferral regime.
default 
defaultWe are happy to talk further on that to a specific question, if you wish.
defaultJiří Króldefault: The AIFMD is currently being implemented in the EU and the 
defaultUK
default.
default 
defaultSome of the uncertainties that previous speakers have mentioned as it relates to remuneration or profit shares have become doubly more complex, because rules on remuneration under th
defaulte AIFMD itself are not quite clear as to whether profit shares count or not as remuneration or as profit shares.
default 
defaultThat goes for various forms of management companies.
default 
defaultSo there is an extra, added complexity for managers who are now preparing to implement AIFMD as well as preparing for the changes that this legislation is likely to bring.
defaultQ61 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Bilimoria:default If I may just build on this and ask some really specific questions, you have said very clearly that you have a particular interest in the changes that will affect the AIFM sector.
default 
defaultTo what extent were you involved in discussing the proposals with HMRC subsequent to the issue of the consultative document in May 2013?
defaultPaul Haledefault: Very considerably.
default 
defaultIn the period from early June to the end of September, we had, I think, three substantial meetings of two hours or more with a considerable team of HMRC, HMT and FCA representatives.
default 
defaultWe had a telephone conversation as well, which was a good hour or so, and a considerable amount of email correspondence.
default 
defaultThat resulted in the development of what is now the AIFM business part of the schedule.
defaultLord Bilimoria:default It seems that the pronounced effect on the firms in your sector came as a surprise to HMRC.
default 
defaultIs that correct?
default 
defaultDid they listen to the points that you made on behalf of the sector?
default 
defaultAre you satisfied with the outcome?
defaultPaul Haledefault: It should not have been a surprise to HMT, HMRC and the FCA, because the very point had been identified in submissions made to the FCA in relation to the introduction of the AIFMD.
default 
defaultIt had been made in liaison meetings with HMT and HMRC, and I am afraid to say that the right channels of communication, quite clearly, had not been present.
default 
defaultThat was over a period of, perhaps, a year to 18 months prior to the consultative document coming out.
defaultTo give, following that brickbat, very much credit, though, to HMRC, HMT and the FCA, when we went to our first meeting with them, the atmosphere and the attitude that they had changed very rapidly when they realised that we had a valid point and one that needed to be addressed.
default 
defaultIt was perhaps sealed when we described the point, which, effectively, is that, if the deferral has to be made of the whole of the remuneration—the 100% of variable—the manager who has been lucky enough to receive this amount of money has, perhaps, 20% in cash and 20% of that amount in fund equities, which he cannot redeem for six months, but he has a tax bill equal to 47% of that amount, which is due in approximately a year’s time—maybe less.
default 
defaultFurther, if he loses remuneration, he still has the tax bill.
default 
defaultWhen the FCA representative confirmed, more or less with the one-word answer “
defaultYes
default”, when HMRC asked “Is that a correct interpretation of the effects of the deferral rules?”, there was a considerable amount of willingness to find a solution to this.
default 
defaultThe effort spent on this must have been a considerable part of the workload of Richard Rogers at HMRC and his team over those few months.
default 
defaultIn that sense, yes, we made the point and it was listened to, but I am afraid it was not one that should have been new to them, because it had been communicated clearly to them.
defaultLord Bilimoria:default Is this what you see as a justification for a different outcome for your members when other partnerships—for example, in the agricultural sector, we have just heard—see the need to retain profits for business expansion?
defaultPaul Haledefault: This part of the schedule—the AIFM business—addresses a very particular problem, which is the cash flow and tax liability position of members of an AIFM business.
default 
defaultIt does not enable hedge fund managers to retain cash for working capital or to indulge in any other sort of scheme.
default 
defaultAs I said, it is not a tax-raising measure.
default 
defaultThe key point of the arrangement, which, I am afraid, the representative of the accountancy professions did not fully grasp, is that the tax on the variable remuneration can, if the business and the member elect to go within the scheme, because it is voluntary, be raised if the profits are deemed for tax purposes to be accruing to the business itself—the LLP—even though it is not a person for tax purposes.
default 
defaultThe LLP then has a tax liability on that amount equal to 45%, and the LLP pays that tax.
defaultWhen the profits vest in the partner in whom they are originally intended to go to
default,
default in perhaps three years’ time, that partner is treated at that point as receiving the gross amount of the profits, which includes a tax credit for that 45%.
default 
defaultThose profits are treated as arising to him as the profits of the trade in that later year of assessment.
default 
defaultThe amount of tax that he pays will then depend on what the tax rate is at that period.
default 
defaultIf we have a Government that has put it up to 50% from 45%, he suffers.
default 
defaultHe can also bring into account any reliefs like pension payments, gift aid or trading losses that are available.
default 
defaultSo, we have had a payment on account and then a realignment when the deferred profits adjust, and everybody, give or take the vagaries of life, is happy.
defaultIf the profits have not vested, then, from a tax point of view, that is it: the amount is treated as a capital sum.
default 
defaultIf it is reallocated by the LLP to other partners, they get it—a share of the 55 that is left out of the 100—and there is no further tax liability, but the tax credit that was paid on it cannot be recovered.
default 
defaultAgain, that reflects what the position is under current law: that, if a partnership, say, has retained an amount of money and not distributed it to its partners, the partners will have paid tax on that.
default 
defaultIf it then decides it does not need this money but will reallocate it
default to
default particular partners, they have no tax liability on it, because it is an amount of capital within that partnership.
default 
defaultThat is a very convenient and easy way of resolving the issue of how to deal with lost, unvested deferred remuneration.
default 
defaultIf you wanted to be more rigorous, as it were, and trace through the tax credit and see how the profits vest through into other partners who get this at second, third or fourth hand, remember the deferral periods of up to five years.
default 
defaultYou could have a paper trail going through various deferral rounds and taking you for 20 years, and that was not appealing to the industry or to the Revenue as an exercise.
defaultQ62 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Bilimoria:default Could I just ask one more question on this area?
default 
defaultDid it surprise you that much of the yield from the package of legislation affecting partnerships comes from firms in your sector—about 
default£
default680 million out of the total yield of just over 
default£
default1 billion?
default 
defaultWhere does this yield come from and were your firms not paying tax on profits, or paying tax at a lower rate?
defaultPaul Haledefault: You will have to ask HMRC how they arrive at those figures.
default 
defaultI would also point out that, although we are the Alternative Investment Management Association—we represent hedge funds—there are other industries in the alternative investment management sector, such as private equity firms, infrastructure businesses and real estate firms which could be included in the alternative investment sector, as referred to in the budget estimates that were put out.
default 
defaultThe Revenue will have their reason for believing that there is that money there.
default 
defaultIt seems a lot from our point of view.
defaultThe Chairman:default Does it surprise you that it is thought to be £680 million?
defaultPaul Haledefault: I have no reason for knowing whether that figure is accurate or not, or how it is arrived at, in terms of its accuracy.
defaultLord Bilimoria:default Just to clarify, are you saying that a lot of this could be from people who are not your members?
defaultPaul Haledefault: I am saying that I do not know where it is coming from, but it could be, because there are or have been arrangements out there for the avoidance of tax using corporate members.
default 
defaultThat is why the profit-shifting rules have been brought in.
default 
defaultThey are capable of being used by businesses across a wide range.
default 
defaultWho knows?
default 
defaultIt may be that some of the City law firms or the accountancy firms have also implemented them.
default 
defaultHedge fund businesses have made money; therefore, the opportunity to look at using these schemes would be there.
default 
defaultHowever, what the likely take would be if the rules are implemented and are effective, I have no way of assessing.
defaultJiří Króldefault: Just to clarify, the Government always mentions AIFM business, and the AIFM Directive covers the entirety of asset management business which is non-UCITS.
default 
defaultUCITS is another horrible acronym, which covers, basically, mutual funds and retail funds.
default 
defaultAny non-retail asset manager, including, as Paul has said, funds that are retail but do not meet UCITS directive requirements—unit trusts, real estate funds and private equity—is within the AIFM sector, so we do not know whether there are any more detailed estimates on the different sub-sectors within the HMRC calculations.
defaultBaroness Drake:default I would like to pursue a small point, Mr Hale.
default 
defaultIt is your comment about you having no idea where the £680 million came from or how it was determined.
default 
defaultDoes that imply a comment on the impact assessment and how these things were assessed?
default 
defaultDo you have any input into that assessment?
defaultPaul Haledefault: We are dealing with a tax avoidance measure here, so HMRC will be working from information that they have, which is confidential, because it is the affairs of taxpayers.
default 
defaultIt will be their analysis of what abuses are out there, how widespread they are and, very importantly, what scope there is for that abuse to swell and be taken up by more and more people, if it is not checked.
default 
defaultUnless that sort of detail is released, it is very difficult for persons in our position to make any judgment as to whether it is an accurate figure or not.
default 
defaultI think they say that their figures have been verified by the OBR or somebody.
defaultBaroness Drake:default Previous commentators have commented that they do not like the quality of the impact assessment.
default 
defaultYou are saying that you could not know what the quality of that is, because it is based on privileged information and you would not have access to it.
defaultPaul Haledefault: Yes, and also what it must be based on is the projected profits of businesses.
default 
defaultFor asset managers, those profits are very closely correlated to their success in producing investment returns for their clients.
default 
defaultIf the markets go up, it is easier to make money; if the markets are awkward, it is harder to make money.
default 
defaultThere is implicitly some sort of investment return forecast in those figures.
default 
defaultIt is not apparent, on the face of it, what that might be.
defaultQ63 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultThe Chairman:default I wonder if you could help us, perhaps, in another way.
default 
defaultIt is intriguing to us, as a Committee, to investigate, and you quite rightly gave us a very clear view as to how taxation works within your industry.
default 
defaultYou do not have any great information to tell us about the £680 million, which we understand, but am I right in concluding from what you said to us that, so far as these new proposals are concerned, there is not a substantial difference in the amount of tax your members will be paying under the new system?
defaultPaul Haledefault: I may have misunderstood your question.
default 
defaultThe specific AIFM business proposal is an easement.
default 
defaultIt is not a tax-raising measure; it enables managers to comply with certain requirements, or voluntary versions of those regulatory requirements, without being in a predicament that Mr Micawber would recognise.
default 
defaultThe other parts of the legislation will be revenue-raising, or potentially revenue-raising, within our industry, because the salaried partners’ provisions will require that some businesses at least will have to look at particular partners—particular members of the LLPs—and decide whether they pass these tests.
default 
defaultOur suspicion is that there will be very many businesses not affected by it; in principle, it is going to affect smaller businesses less because it will be easier to show that people have a significant influence.
default 
defaultIf you are six partners, even if one is ever so junior, it is possible to say he has a significant influence.
default 
defaultThe other provisions on reallocation of profits—and that is part of the chapter that has other strains in it, which, I think, are not likely to be relevant—are directed at particular schemes.
default 
defaultTo the extent that those schemes have been used within our industry or any other industry, if those provisions are effective they will have the consequence of producing a tax take from those firms that would otherwise use them, which is more consistent with what it should be.
defaultThe Chairman:default That is very helpful.
defaultQ64 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Joffe:default How open and responsive do you think the consultation process has been?
default 
defaultDo you think that you have had adequate opportunity and time to make your case?
defaultPaul Haledefault: One of the problems with the consultation procedure, which follows a fairly rigid process, is that, in fact, it was undertaken, rightfully, conscientiously by HMRC.
default 
defaultThey started going out and talking to interested bodies about these proposals very early, which was the correct thing to do, because they are complicated and significant and they affect a large part of the economy.
default 
defaultAs a result of that and the comments they were getting, HMRC and HMT realised that various parts of those proposals would need to be changed.
default 
defaultFor instance, on the salaried partners’ provisions, originally there was a two-tier test—a sort of filter, if you like.
default 
defaultThe first filter was: is this partner, under ordinary law, an employee of the LLP?
default 
defaultWe were not involved in the discussions on that, so this is hearsay, but a number of members of our organisation who were have contacted us, so it is not bad hearsay.
default 
defaultThe message that came through to the Government very quickly on that was that that test does not get anywhere, because it is not going to filter out more than, say, 1% of the partners the Government was interested in, because the tests of employment are really not very appropriate to deciding whether someone is a partner or not.
defaultSo you were left with the second tier of tests.
default 
defaultThat tier of tests, as framed in the consultative document, was widely seen as impractical, and it was in response to that that the Revenue went away and reformulated the current three conditions we have.
default 
defaultThose conditions may or may not be useful but they were being formulated, and there was a good deal of input from a good number of interested parties.
default 
defaultIt may be that the Revenue was talking mainly to people in the City and to City-based institutions, like the Chartered Institute of Taxation and so on, and was not talking more widely around the country, but it really was 
defaultthe
default case that, by the time we put in our response to the consultation, which closed on about 8 or 9 August, we were really replying to a consultation on a series of proposals that had been altered in quite a lot of important respects.
default 
defaultYou may regard that as an effective consultation, because the Revenue were hearing things, listing things and acting on them.
default 
defaultIn some ways, it is also a waste of time because a lot of points were being made at the expense of a good deal of paper and a good deal of effort on parts of respondents that had already been addressed and were no longer part of the proposal.
defaultJiří Króldefault: To add a comparative point, the UK Government’s consultation procedure is incredibly open and is much more thorough than what we experience in other jurisdictions.
default 
defaultWe see that there is willingness to engage and willingness to listen, even though
default, in the end, we may not be happy with the results because there may be political decisions taken and policy will go left rather than right.
default 
defaultIn that respect, we would definitely commend the engagement.
default 
defaultIn particular, for the first time, we have seen the FCA, HMRC and HMT working closely together on something that is quite complex, and that is the interaction between the regulatory rules coming from Brussels, where the FCA may not have full scope of flexibility in terms of how they interpret the rules and how they can work with the industry, and the tax authorities, to produce something that, at least, is not extremely harmful; to produce something that, as Paul said, is an easement and makes the regime practicable for our members.
defaultLord Joffe:default That is a comforting response, but what is your view of the assessments made by the Government of the impact of the proposed tax changes on business in your sector?
defaultJiří defaultKróldefault: The biggest point, and the biggest complaint, that we have heard from our membership, first and foremost, has been the uncertainty.
default 
defaultThe fact is that we are facing enormous changes, and not just within our sector; the entire financial market is b
defaulteing overhauled, and it would be nice to have something stable on the tax side for businesses to be able to plan for, and something solid to rely on for the next several years.
default 
defaultIn that respect, there was a big complaint about the overall business climate that some of these profound changes are going to effect.
default 
defaultPaul Haledefault: The Government had, at the time of the budget, launched its 
defaultUK
default investment management strategy, one of the key issues in which was a certainty of taxation regime, and consultation about taxation proposals, and so on.
default 
defaultThen, 30 seconds after, it produces this consultation document on partnerships that has a tremendous disruptive effect on the industry.
default 
defaultThe Chairman:default I wonder if we could ask the same questions of Mr Parker, as to the consultative arrangements and agriculture.
defaultMichael Parkerdefault: The consultation was very open. We, as an industry group, managed to get a meeting with HMRC.
default 
defaultWe were able to give some views, and make the point that just because a partnership is a mixed partnership does not mean that there is a tax advantage. For example, a mixed partnership does not have an annual investment allowance on plant and machinery, which could be an issue for some farming businesses.
default 
defaultWe were also able to give examples of where mixed partnerships that are commercially driven historically came into being and the land tenure points.
default 
defaultI agree, really, that whether those points went any further than being listened to is another matter.
default 
defaultIt seems as though there had been a decision in terms of how the policy was going to be implemented and how the legislation would be formed, and it was just a question of evaluating whether there are unforeseen consequences, as there may be in industries such as ours.
default 
defaultQ65 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultThe Chairman:default I wonder if I could ask one final question.
default 
defaultDo you think the Government does enough to monitor and evaluate whether the tax changes it has introduced meet their policy objectives, and if not, what more should they do?
default 
defaultPaul Haledefault: There are, perhaps, two different types of tax change here that need to be considered.
default 
defaultThe first, which is really what we have been talking about today, is anti-avoidance measures.
default 
defaultThose are effectively monitored, because HMRC has identified an abuse and told the Government it needs to be dealt with.
default 
defaultHaving introduced the legislation
default,
default they will continue to monitor tax returns, disclosures of tax schemes et cetera to try and determine whether it has been effective or not, so in that sense that monitoring is continuous.
default 
defaultSome form of public report to say, “Yes this has been successful; hey, look, we think we have saved 
default£
defaultX billion from being lost” may or may not be necessary.
defaultThe other sort of tax change out there is a measure that would be designed to influence behaviour, or encourage investment, or something like that.
default 
defaultThere is a much stronger case for having a more formal system for reviewing that.
default 
defaultPresumably, the Treasury does internally wish to know whether a measure that has been promoted has been successful.
default 
defaultPresumably, where it has been promoted at the behest of an interested body, they will be monitoring it.
default 
defaultSo, if you have some sort of relief for building wind farms or producing films in the UK, interest groups will be getting input from their members as to whether it is working or not.
default 
defaultNow, there is always going to be a time lag in finding out how effective something like that is, because tax returns come in, say, a year after the profits have been earned against which the relief is being claimed, and then they are considered.
default 
defaultYou are always going to have a timescale of two or three years before the results are known.
default 
defaultHowever, presumably, if a measure has been introduced for a policy reason like that, then there should be a mechanism of evaluating whether it has been successful.
default 
defaultIt would be interesting for the general public to know whether the relief has been put to good use or not.
default 
default 
defaultQ66 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultBaroness Drake:default I will try to make this very brief.
default 
defaultMr Hale, of the three economic tests—variable profits, influence over management and capital contribution—which will pose the greatest challenge to your members?
default 
defaultPaul Haledefault: To go in reverse order, as it were, the capital test is very likely to be of absolutely no help.
default 
defaultHedge fund management businesses, because they do not hold client money, and as I said at the beginning, because they are not trading their own assets, have a very low regulatory capital requirement.
default 
defaultIt may be something like 13 weeks’ expenses.
default 
defaultIf things go well in a hedge fund, the financial rewards are very great and the variable remuneration therefore could well be expected to be more than four times the amount of capital that the individual has put in.
default 
defaultThe variable remuneration, in some businesses, would be an issue.
default 
defaultIt is not quite clear how that is defined and operated in practice. There is, as drafted, a definite link to the overall profits of the business.
default 
defaultIn a lot of businesses, you will have people who are remunerated, to some extent, by the results of their own income stream.
default 
defaultThe accountancy bodies touched on that earlier.
default 
defaultHowever, you could well have a situation in a fund management business where you have, perhaps, three funds and three separate teams that are largely responsible for each fund.
default 
defaultTheir remuneration will be tailored to those particular funds’ performance, rather than to the performance of the business as a whole.
default 
defaultNow, you may be able to come up with an arrangement in your partnership agreement that says your remuneration will be assessed by looking at the profits of the business as a whole, and deciding what proportion of that profit you will get in terms of performance units.
default 
defaultPerformance units will be geared to what you have done in your own part of the business.
default 
defaultIs that getting close enough to the parties being affected substantially by the whole profits of the business or not?
default 
defaultI do not know.
default 
defaultThe draft guidance the Revenue has published is not particularly helpful on that point.
default 
defaultThen, finally, there is significant influence.
default 
defaultIt is clear that significant influence does not mean the abi
defaultlity to control the business; it means the ability to make your voice heard and have your opinions taken into account.
default 
defaultThe Revenue suggest in their guidance that if you have a management board of 10 they would regard, in principle, all of those 10 as having significant influence.
default 
defaultIf you have more than 10 on the board, some of those people would not have significant influence.
default 
defaultThat characteristic is going to be one that will help clarify the position of a lot of members in hedge fund management businesses, because—and again, I do not have the figures on this—my experience is that a lot of the businesses are 10 partners or less.
default 
defaultHowever, there will be some businesses where you have a large number of partners and/or distinct income or profit streams within the business, where there will be more of an issue.
default 
defaultQ67 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default Can I just ask, Mr Parker, on the more general question of monitoring and evaluating things, whether you think the Inland Revenue are satisfactory from your point of view?
default 
defaultDo they do a good job?
defaultMichael Parkerdefault: Certainly, it is desirable to continue to evaluate post
default&#x2011;
defaultimplementation, to see whether impact assessments are accurate, whether implementation costs for HMRC and the taxpayers have been fully taken into account, and also whether there are unintended consequences.
default 
defaultHas it only affected its policy target or have there been others that have been brought into the legislation, and has that affected levels of investment, particularly for certain industries or those that were not the intended target of the policy?
default 
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you all very much for coming.
default 
defaultI do not say this at the end of every session, but I think I have learned something today that I did not know before, and that, in itself, as far as I am concerned, makes it very valuable.
default 
defaultYou certainly were very helpful to the Committee and I am very grateful to you for coming.
default 
defaultThank you very much indeed.
