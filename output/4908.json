"&#xa0;\nSubmission from the London Assembly (FDC12)&#xa0;\nThe London Assembly comprises 25 politicians who are elected to hold the Mayor of London to account and investigate issues of \nimportance\n to Londoners.  London Assembly Members are elected at the same time as the Mayor. Eleven represent the whole capital an\nd 14 are elected by constituencies.  The London Assembly carries out investigations into issues through cross-party committees, which often look at long-term issues facing London.  \nIt also holds the Mayor to account through monthly Mayor’s Question Time me\netings. \n&#xa0;\nT\nhe London Assembly welcomes the \nCLG Committee’s inquiry into fiscal devolution to cities and city regions. This follows the work undertaken by the London Finance Commission \n(LFC) \nand the publication of its \nfinal report, \nRaising the Capital\n, \no\nn\n 1\n5 May 2013.\n&#xa0;\nThat report \nexamine\nd\n the potential for greater devolution of both taxation and the control of resources in London an\nd\n develop\ned\n options to improve \nthe city’\ns tax and spending arrangements\n.\n \nIt recommended that London government should retain bu\nsiness rates and take full control over council tax and stamp duty land tax\n. \nIt also proposed that the yields from such taxes should be offset by a corresponding reduction in grant to ensure any changes be \nfiscally neutral for the Exchequer\n.\n \nThe intention \nis that with such additional powers, the city can\n fund \ninfrastructure both to cater for the \nexpansion \nalready forecast for its population and economy,\n \nand to promote additional economic growth. \nThe report\n also called\n for a relaxation of\n restrictions on bor\nrowing for capital\n \ninvestment within prudential rules\n. \n \n&#xa0;\nThe London Assembly is unanimous in \nits support of\n the \nprinciples and detailed recommendations put forward by the London Finance Commission\n. John Biggs, AM, represented the Assembly on the LFC and w\ne \nhave also \nhad extensive discussions on the proposals with Professor\n \nTony Travers, who chaired the Commission, \nwhen he \nappeared in front of the London Assembly \non 5 June 2013. \n&#xa0;\nWere the London Finance Commission recommendations to be implemented, it woul\nd give the\n London Mayor \nenhanced powers over taxation and borrowing. \nThe Assembly is firmly of the view that \nthis would need to be balanced by enhanced \nlocal accountability\n. \nT\nhe\n LFC report \nrecognises this\n: \n“If the Mayor assumed substantial additional taxat\nion responsibilities it would be necessary to review the Assembly’s powers with a view to enhancing them\n.\n” \nThis was reinforced by Professor Travers who told the \nAssembly\n that “\nthe Assembly’s powers need to be strengthened pro rata\n”\n.\n  \n&#xa0;\nThe Assembly would \nseek a\ndditional responsibilities in respect of \nboth\n taxation and borrowing\n. \nIt has \nset up a \nFinancial Devolution Working Group \nt\no \ndevelop more detailed proposals\n \nfor\n \nAssembly\n \npowers with respect to\n \ncouncil tax, stamp duty land \ntax, business rates\n,\n \nother ta\nxes, \nTax Increment Financing schemes and the Mayor’s infrastructure plan. \nThe Assembly\n \nwould \ncertainly \nseek the \nability to amend any new tax proposals by the Mayor \nin the same way that it currently amend\ns\n the Mayor’s budget\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe Assembly support\ns\n the application of the principles developed by the London Finance Commission to other English cities. \nHowever, \nit is n\not for the Greater London Authority\n or the London Assembly to \ndefine \nthe \nprecise geographical and accountability arrangements that would \nbe appropriate for\n such\n \ndevolution. That is an issue for the \npeople and representatives of \neach locality to decide. \n&#xa0;\nConclusion&#xa0;\nThe Assembly\n \nwould \nurge the Committee to \ngive detailed consideration to \nthe \nneed for proper \ngovernance and \nlocal \naccountabilit\ny \ni\nn \nthe event of\n fiscal devolution to English cities. In London, i\nf the recommendations of the \nLFC\n were implemented, the \nMayor \nwould see a substantial increase in tax raising and \nborrowing \npowers. \nSuch\n an expansion of the executive’s role and function sho\nuld be effectively balanced by \nstrengthened accountability via\n \nthe London Assembly. \n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n1\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.london.gov.uk/moderngov/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=179&amp;MId=4845\n&#xa0;\n"
