"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the  Police &amp; Crime Commissioner for Sussex [CST0051]&#xa0;&#xa0;\nFurther to \nt\nhe\n Public Administration \nSelect\n Committee Inquiry into \nCrime Statistics\n, Katy Bourne, the Sussex Police &amp; Crime Commissioner, would like to make the following response.\n&#xa0;\nWhat, if any, targets do you set for your police force? What impact do you think this has on police recording crime practices?&#xa0;Sussex Police Authority had 18 targets in their 2012\n/2013 Local Policing Plan\n. \nTo an extent these targets dictated specific activity and \nunhelpfully \nincentivised police officers to pursue particular outcomes and crime types ahead of others. \nBy contrast, the\n Commissioner\n’s Police &amp; Crime Plan has removed these targets and the associated performance pressures they bring. There is now an emphasis on strengthening police of\nficer discretion to focus activity around local priorities \nw\nhich differ by district and division. \n&#xa0;\nMrs Bourne acknowledges that t\nhis approach empowers \nlocal District Commanders\n and staff \nwith greater \ndiscretion \nto exercise their professional judgement to ensure that offenders are dealt with by the most appropriate disposal available, in the knowledge that no one outcome is favoured over others. Strengthening police officer \nand staff \ndiscretion should in turn promote a more victim\n-\nfocussed\n approach, \ndetermined to\n provid\ne\n a better service to victims of crime by removing perverse incentives for forces to record and pro-actively pursue certain crimes on the basis of locally-set detection targets, and encouraging officers\n and staff\n to consider the needs of victims, and the potential for engaging them in the process. \n&#xa0;\nThe Commissioner appreciates that t\nargets can provide a useful method of measuring performance in terms of evaluating the effectiveness and appropriateness of the allocation of resources across different activities and crime types. However, local priorities will vary from one district to another (as described above). It is also worth emphasising that Sussex Police are still monitoring their performance internally which is set out in th\neir Operational Delivery Plan and the Commissioner keeps a close watch on this performance.\n&#xa0;\nHow do you assure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct? To what extent can you trust the crime statistics for your area?&#xa0;The Commissioner is \nreassured\n that the crimes in Sussex are being recorded and categorised correctly\n which ensures \nintegrity of the data\n.\n&#xa0;\nMrs Bourne has recently met with Superintendent Samantha Coates, Force Crime Intelligence, and Mr George Welch, Force Crime Registrar to discuss recorded crime in Sussex. The Commissioner will continue to closely monitor this area at her monthly Performance &amp; Accountability Meetings (PAMs) with the Chief Constable. These PAMs are webcast online and available to \nview on \nwww.sussex-pcc.gov.uk\n.\n              \n   \n&#xa0;\nMrs Bourne appreciates that Sussex Police have endeavoured to improve the integrity of their recorded crime by changing the culture within the Force from the top down (in\ncluding the removal of targets). This has also included improving the \nsystems and processes\n in place, including the implementation of Niche, which brings together all of the \ncrime data and \ninformation in one place and enables \nofficers and staff to work with increased \nflexib\ni\nl\nit\ny.\n \nIn addition, \nofficers and staff \nhave been provided with\n \nfurther traini\nng to improve\n their\n skill levels using the new \nsystems and \nprocesses, together with increased discretion for officers and staff. \n&#xa0;\nThe Commissioner is confident that the crime recording practices within Sussex\n Police are increasingly victim-\nfocussed because every report is treated as a crime in the first instance, until it is proved otherwise. However, there is an obvious continuum between what is and what is not a crime and elements of subjectivity, in between. This ensures that officers and staff are not fixated on chasing obtuse targets but there are risks associated with increased officer and staff discretion which need to be managed accordingly.\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
