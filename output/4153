defaultWe do not oppose a levy on plastic bags.
defaultHowever, the promotion of degradable bags via a levy exemption would be an error on many levels as both bio-degradable and

default-degradable bags according to scientific studies released by DEFRA and the Environment Agency:
default1. have a greater environmental impact than conventional bags;
default2. cannot be separated from conventional non degradable bags, so the whole stream will go to disposal rather than recycling
defaultThe study released by the Environment Agency states: “Starch-polyester blend bags have a higher global warming potential and

default depletion than conventional polymer bags…. This was partially due to it weighing approximately twice that of the conventional HDPE bags but also due to the high impacts of raw material production, transport and the generation of methane from landfill.”
defaultThe study released by DEFRA states that “incorporation of additives… that cause plastics to undergo accelerated degradation does not improve their environmental impact and potentially gives rise to certain negative effects…

default-degradable plastics are not suitable for recycling with main-stream plastics.”
defaultApart from the damaging environmental impact of such degradable materials, some of which contain heavy metals, it is not possible to effectively sort and recycle them. They will simply pollute other recycled materials. As a result the UK Government will fail to meet its stringent plastic recycling targets for 2017.
