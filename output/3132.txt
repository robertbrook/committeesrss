[[[Written submission from Benjamin Lenyk ]]]&#xa0;I am an electrician with over 15 years experience in the electrical industry.Having just viewed the recording of the above meeting between the committee and representatives of the industry I hold so dear, I feel I must speak out.It is painfully apparent to me and other electricians whom have to deal with the schemes and the red tape associated with them that the issue of consumer safety is no longer the main driving purpose behind their existence. As with any organisation of this type, the main driving force is financial gain.When I first entered the industry which wasn’t all that long ago (1997), things were so much easier for everyone involved. There were only two regulatory bodies within the industry – NICEIC and the ECA. The introduction of Part P which was one of the biggest ill thought out ‘white elephants’ the industry has very seen, only served to penalise the already cash strapped tradesman even further.Of course with it came the opportunity for every man and his dog to set up a self certification scheme that the humble electrician must join in order for him or her to continue carrying out electrical work the he or she had been previously doing for the 20, 30 or even 40 years prior. Now, I’m not against Part P per se, any attempt to raise the safety standard is highly commendable but, its implementation and subsequent running is at best awful and has only served to give ‘credibility to cowboys’.As one of the representatives, Phil Buckle I believe, said, awareness of Part P to ‘Joe Public’ is at 14% and decreasing now, if the main reason for the schemes and subsequent register instigation is unknown to the very people it’s there to protect, what chances does a new register let alone two have of being useful.I believe this issue if left to the financially motivates scheme operators, will never resolve itself and implore you to recommend to the minister that he must step in and begin proceedings to initiate a single mandatory scheme in the same format at the highly successful GasSafe and its predecessor Corgi.Every single member of the associated gas trade and ‘Joe Public’ is aware of GasSafe, its intentions, its standards and its stance on unsafe and un-permitted gas work. Obviously he will meet strong resistance from these scheme operators as he would be seeking to put their ‘cash cow’ out to pasture but, he will receive fare greater support from the tens of thousands of downtrodden electricians that have to pander to and swell the coffers of these operators on a yearly basis. Again, most electricians would be only too happy to pay an annual membership fee, that is not my gripe my gripe at the moment is what are we getting for our money not very much at all is my answer except for what seems to be company directors whom are financially motivated with a playground capacity and a ‘my dad’s bigger than your dad’ mentality.Should you require evidence of the money motivation that drives these schemes, you only need to look at the current rules for enrolment and compare them to the rules of 10 years ago, you will see that I am correct and that they now accept any Tom Dick or Harry even bending the already watered down rules to accommodate them as long as he has his £400-£500 registration fee.I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this with you further but appreciate you are a busy man and probably won’t have the time for a single voice like mine in a sea of many others.I do however run an internet discussion forum for electricians, electrical contractors and engineers (www.electriciansboards.co.uk) should you wish to visit and see the views of other electricians such as myself but I think I speak for us all when I say the vast majority will only echo my sentiments herein.I would like to thank you for taking the time to read my email and do await any response you make with high anticipation.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
