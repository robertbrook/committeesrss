[normal]Written evidence from East Sutton Parish Council (TIC 099)
[normal]The passenger transport in East Sutton is virtually non existent. There is a bus that runs infrequently but is at least a 30 minute walk to the bus stop for fit parishioners. For the elderly it is not an option, leaving them relying on 
[normal]their own transport or the assistance of others.
