[normal]Supplementary written evidence submitted by the Department for Work and Pensions[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The following information was requested by the Committee after the evidence session
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question 1[bold]There are no plans to publish anything else on destinations but we continue 
[normal]to monitor the progress of Incapacity Benefit Reassessments. The link to the 2011 report is below:
[normal]https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/upload
[normal]s/attachment_data/file/214578/rrep791.pdf
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question 2[bold]1.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Can people be required to sign on if they are not receiving benefit because of a sanction?
[normal]"signing on" is shorthand for continue to be entitled to J
[normal]obseeker’s Allowance (J
[normal]SA
[normal])
[normal]. Claimants who are 
[normal]sanctioned continue to be entitled to JSA throughout a sanction period as long as they continue to meet the conditions of entitlement.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] We monitor these conditions by requiring claimants to "sign on" - in other words, attend reviews where their compliance 
[normal]with the actively seeking and available for work conditions is checked.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] A claimant who fails to meet these requirements would - as normal - be disentitled.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Where a claimant is disentitled they will not appear on the claimant count.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Are there any st
[normal]atistics on the number and proportion of sanctioned claimants who do NOT continue to sign on during the period of their sanction or for a longer period?
[normal]We cannot quantify the number of claimants who choose to end their JSA claim as a result of a sanction 
[normal]referral or decision to apply a sanction as the claimant could have ended their JSA claim for other reasons.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] There are incentives on claimants to continue to "sign on" during a sanction - to continue to receive JCP support and to receive hardship payments
[normal] (to receive hardship claimants must remain on JSA).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] More generally, as sanction volumes have increased we have not seen a corresponding increase in off-flows.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The recent decline in the claimant count is primarily driven by falling on-flows.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question 3[bold]In addition the Minister said there would be a second independent review – separate to the Matthew Oakley review – of the sanction process and the WPSC asked for information on this.
[normal]Since taking over her new portfolio, the Minister for Employment has take
[normal]n a close interest in the sanctions regime and has asked for a review of the application of the regime.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We will share more details of the review, including the Terms of Reference, with the Committee shortly.
