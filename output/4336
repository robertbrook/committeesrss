defaultThe following information was requested by the Committee after the evidence session

default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 1defaultThere are no plans to publish anything else on destinations but we continue

default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 2default1.
default&#xa0;
default Can people be required to sign on if they are not receiving benefit because of a sanction?
default"signing on" is shorthand for continue to be entitled to J
defaultobseeker’s Allowance (J
defaultSA
default)
default. Claimants who are 
defaultsanctioned continue to be entitled to JSA throughout a sanction period as long as they continue to meet the conditions of entitlement.
default&#xa0;
default We monitor these conditions by requiring claimants to "sign on" - in other words, attend reviews where their compliance 
defaultwith the actively seeking and available for work conditions is checked.
default&#xa0;
default A claimant who fails to meet these requirements would - as normal - be disentitled.
default&#xa0;
default Where a claimant is disentitled they will not appear on the claimant count.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.
default&#xa0;
default Are there any st
defaultatistics on the number and proportion of sanctioned claimants who do NOT continue to sign on during the period of their sanction or for a longer period?
defaultWe cannot quantify the number of claimants who choose to end their JSA claim as a result of a sanction 
defaultreferral or decision to apply a sanction as the claimant could have ended their JSA claim for other reasons.
default&#xa0;
default There are incentives on claimants to continue to "sign on" during a sanction - to continue to receive JCP support and to receive hardship payments
default (to receive hardship claimants must remain on JSA).
default&#xa0;
default More generally, as sanction volumes have increased we have not seen a corresponding increase in off-flows.
default&#xa0;
default The recent decline in the claimant count is primarily driven by falling on-flows.
default&#xa0;
defaultQuestion 3defaultIn addition the Minister said there would be a second independent review – separate to the Matthew Oakley review – of the sanction process and the WPSC asked for information on this.
defaultSince taking over her new portfolio, the Minister for Employment has take
defaultn a close interest in the sanctions regime and has asked for a review of the application of the regime.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWe will share more details of the review, including the Terms of Reference, with the Committee shortly.
