[[[Written evidence submitted by Dr Ruth Dixon (IPC0023)]]]I am submitting this evidence on the subject of scrutiny and review of the IPCC report. I am not associated with the IPCC and my evidence is drawn from published sources. I have undertaken academic research and teaching at the University of Oxford since 1986. I am the author or co-author of over 50 peer-reviewed publications in the natural sciences (chemistry and biochemistry) and the social sciences. I have also reviewed numerous papers for academic journals. The views in this evidence are my own, and do not represent the views of my employer or any other organization. 

[[[The Review Process for IPCC Reports]]]

[[[Summary]]]My evidence addresses the Committee’s questions: ‘

[[[Has the IPCC adequately addressed criticisms of previous reports?]]]

[[[’ and ]]]

[[[‘]]]

[[[To what extent does AR5 reflect the range of views among climate scientists?]]]

[[[’]]]‘This independent review of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was undertaken by the InterAcademy Council (IAC) under a $950,000 contract signed in April 2010 with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).’  The IAC Review Committee convened for the purpose comprised twelve experts under the chairmanship of Harold Shapiro, professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University, USA.‘Coordinating Lead Authors and Lead Authors have considerable influence over which viewpoints will be discussed. Having author teams with diverse viewpoints is the first step toward ensuring that a full range of thoughtful views are considered. Equally important is combating confirmation bias—the tendency of authors to place too much weight on their own views relative to other views [citation]. As pointed out to the Committee by a presenter and some questionnaire respondents, alternative views are not always cited in a chapter if the Lead Authors do not agree with them. Getting the balance right is an ongoing struggle.’ The review recommended that: ‘Lead Authors should explicitly document that a range of scientific viewpoints has been considered, and  coordinating Lead Authors and Review Editors should satisfy themselves that due consideration was given to properly documented alternative views.’‘A near-universal observation—made in presentations, interviews, and responses to the questionnaire—was the need to strengthen the authority of the Review Editors to ensure that authors consider the review comments carefully and document their responses. With a tight schedule for completing revisions, authors do not always do an adequate job of revising the text, and Review Editors do not always require an explanation for rejected comments. In the case of the incorrect projection of the disappearance of the Himalayan glaciers, for example, some of the review comments were not adequately considered and the justifications were not completely explained (see Box 2.1). Although a few errors are likely to be missed in any review process, stronger enforcement of existing IPCC procedures by the Review Editors could minimize their number. This includes paying special attention to review comments that point out contradictions, unreferenced literature, or potential errors; and ensuring that alternate views receive proper consideration.’ The IAC Review recommended that the role of Review Editors should be strengthened, but noted that even if that were done ‘it would not make the review process truly independent because the Working Group Co-chairs, who have overall responsibility for the preparation of the reports, are also responsible for selecting Review Editors.’ The IAC Review suggested that the IPCC should consider instituting a completely independent review process.The 2013 version of the Principles is in some ways less specific than the earlier version. For instance, the 2008 version said that ‘the review circulation should include: Experts who have significant expertise and/or publications in particular areas covered by the Report’ while the 2013 version simply mentioned ‘as wide a group of experts as possible.’ The IAC’s recommendations for streamlining the review process for authors were not acted upon.No changes were made to the role, powers or remit of Review Editors. The 2013 IPCC Principles (like the 2008 version) emphasised that ‘responsibility for the final text remains with the Lead Authors.’

The IAC Review’s recommendations on the representation of uncertainty, on conflict of interest policy, and on the establishment of an IPCC Executive Committee with independent members and the IPCC’s responses to those recommendations are also very pertinent to the Committee’s inquiry but are beyond the scope of my submission. This suggestion was not, however, one of the formal recommendations of the IAC Review. http://www.ipcc.ch/organization/organization_review.shtml The 2013 version of ‘Appendix A to the Principles Governing IPCC Work’ (the ‘IPCC Principles’) is here: http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/ipcc-principles/ipcc-principles-appendix-a-final.pdf and the 2008 version is here: http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/ipcc-principles/ipcc-principles-appendix-a.pdf  http://climateaudit.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/wgii_re_reports2007.pdf
