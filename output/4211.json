"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Met Office (IPC0026)&#xa0;Summary&#xa0;&#xa0;How robust are the conclusions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis report? &#xa0;\nHave the IPCC adequately addressed criticisms of previous reports?How much scope is there to question the report’s conclusions?To what extent does AR5 reflect the range of views among climate scientists?Can any of the areas of the science now be considered settled as a result of AR5’s publication, if so which?&#xa0; What areas need further effort to reduce the levels of uncertainty?How effective is AR5 and the summary for policymakers in conveying&#xa0;what is meant by uncertainty in scientific terms? Would a focus on risk rather than uncertainty be useful?Does the AR5 address the reliability of climate models?Has AR5 sufficiently explained the reasons behind the widely reported hiatus in the global surface temperature record?Do the AR5 Physical Science Basis report’s conclusions strengthen or weaken the economic case for action to prevent dangerous climate change? What implications do the IPCC’s conclusions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis report have for policy making both nationally and internationally? Is the IPCC process an effective mechanism for assessing scientific knowledge? Or has it focussed on providing a justification for political commitment?To what extent did political intervention influence the final conclusions of the AR5 Physical Science Basis summary? Is the rate at which the UK Government intends to cut CO2 emissions appropriate in light of the findings of the IPCC AR5 Physical Science Basis report? What relevance do the IPCC’s conclusions have in respect of the review of the fourth Carbon Budget? &#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/ipcc-principles/ipcc-principles.pdf\n \n \nhttp://www.ipcc.ch/organization/organization_procedures.shtml#.Uo8hZ5yDq70\n \n \nhttp://royalsociety.org/uploadedFiles/Royal_Society_Content/policy/publications/2010/4294972962.pdf\n \n t\nhe \nIAC was \ncreated \nin 2000 \nby the world's\n \nscience academies to provide advice to international bodies\n \nhttp://www.int\neracademycouncil.net/24026/26050.aspx\n \nFor example:\n \nhttp://www.bishop-hill.net/discussion/post/1569976\n \nhttps://ipccreport.wordpress.com/2013/09/26/did-sceptics-take-part-in-the-review/\n \nSmith, D M, Eade, R, Dunstone, N J, Fereday, D, Murphy, J M, Pohlm\nann, H and Scaife, A A (2010).
