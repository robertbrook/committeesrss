defaultQ109 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default Good afternoon, and thank you all for giving up this time.
default 
defaultAs you know, we have been doing this inquiry for some time and we hope to finish up in April with a report, which at the moment is looking very interesting because we h
defaultave had some terrific witnesses
default and we are looking forward to what you have to say today.
default 
defaultThe session will last for approximately 50 to 60 minutes, and Members of the Committee with relevant interest
defaults
default will declare these now.
default 
defaultAny interests?
default 
defaultNo.
defaultThe session is on the record and is being webcast live and will be subsequently accessible via the parliamentary website.
default 
defaultWitnesses will receive a transcript of the session to check and correct, and this will be put on the public record in printed form and on the parliamentary website.
default Could you
default begin by stating, for the record, your names and official title
default? A
defaultfter that I will ask you to make an opening statem
defaultent, if that is agreeable to you.
defaultMs Hadjivassilioudefault: G
defaultood afternoon.
default 
defaultThank you for inviting me to be here.
default 
defaultMy name is Kari Hadjivassilio
defaultu and I am a P
defaultrincipal 
defaultR
defaultesearch
default F
defaultellow at the Institute for Employment Studies.
default 
defaultI have been working on issues around European employment and education training policies for about 15 to 20 
defaultyears, and youth unemployment for
default the last four to five years.
default 
defaultMy particular interest is school-to-work transitions and the effectiveness of the existing policies around 
defaultEurope
default, in particular apprenticeships
default, traineeships, internships and the like.
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you, we look forward to you
defaultr
default evidence.
defaultMr Mascherinidefault: Good afternoon.
default 
defaultMy name is Massimiliano Mascherini.
default I am a Research M
defaultanager at Eurofound, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions.
default 
defaultWe are an independent European agency, established in 1975, and our mandate is to produce knowledge in the field of employment and social matters.
defaultProfessor Simmonsdefault: Good afternoon.
default 
defaultI am Robin Simmons and I am Professor of Education at the 
defaultUniversity
default of 
defaultHuddersfield
default.
default 
defaultFor the last five years or so I have been involve
defaultd in
default various research projects looking at the lives of young people who are classified as NEET or at ri
defaultsk of becoming NEET; the 
defaultresearch 
defaultis 
defaultfunded by the Leverhulme Trust and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you.
default 
defaultStarting again, Ms Hadjivassiliou, would you like to make an opening statement before we question you or are you prepared to go straight in? 
defaultMs Hadjivassilioudefault: No, I think
default I will
default go to the questions.
default 
defaultThe opening statement is that the levels of youth unemployment at the moment across 
defaultEurope
default, in my opinion, are unacceptably high.
default 
defaultI a
defaultm encouraged to see that policymakers, at both 
defaultEU and national level, have realised that they have to act as a matter of urgency.
default 
defaultPersonally
default,
default I am not sure that some of the measures proposed are sufficient to addre
defaultss the magnitude of the problem
default but at least a start has been made. 
defaultThe Chairman:default An opening statement from you, Mr Mascherini?
defaultMr Mascherinidefault: 
defaultNo. 
defaultI would like to thank the Committee for the invitation and I look forward to the questions.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultThank you for coming. 
defaultProfessor Simmons? 
defaultProfessor Simmonsdefault: Likewise
default, thank you for the invitation
default but I would like to proceed to the questions.
defaultQ110 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you.
default 
defaultI have to advise the witnesses that some questions will be more relevant to them than others.
default 
defaultEach witness is not expected to provid
defaulte an answer for every question. 
defaultI think you will probably be relieved to hear
default that
default.
defaultA central element of the EU’s approach to tackling youth unemployment is the Youth Guarantee.
default 
defaultCould you summarise for us your understanding of the extent to which this has been taken up across the EU and whether there are signs that it is achieving any results yet?
default 
defaultIf there are statistics available, perhaps you could identify the fact that they are and then
default it would be very useful if you could send 
defaultthem to us as a ba
defaultckup. 
defaultWho wants to answer that question? 
defaultMr Mascherinidefault: I can start.
default 
defaultThe concept of the Youth Guarantee was born in Scandinavian countries in the 1980s and is based on the concept that young people are guaranteed an opp
defaultortunity a certain amount of time after
default becoming unemployed or finishing their education.
default 
defaultAt the European level the discussion about
default the
default Youth Guarantee started in 2005 when the European Council encouraged member state
defaults to guarantee an opportunity for
default young 
defaultpeople four months after
default becoming unemployed.
defaultThe discussion has gone on for years and the European Pa
defaultrliament realised the need to guarantee an opportunity for young people. 
defaultIn December 2012 the European Commission 
defaultmade a proposal for a youth guarantee
default to the European Council.
default 
defaultThat has been endorsed and published by the European Council on 22 April.
default On the basis of the European C
defaultouncil recommendation, the guarantee is that every young person
default has to receive an opportunity four months after
default becoming unemployed or finishing educati
defaulton
default.
default 
defaultThat can be an educational position, a study place, an apprenticeship, an internship, training or
default an offer of
default a job within four months.
default 
defaultThis happened last April.
default 
defaultNow member states are required to submit an implementation plan for the Youth Guarantee.
default 
defaultThe deadline is December 2013 for those member states that have a
defaultn un
defaultemployment rate higher than 25%;
default otherwise it is spring 2014 for the other member states.
default 
defaultThe level of unemployment below or above 25% is the condition for accessing funding.
default 
defaultIn this regard, €6 billion has been made available for those re
defaultgions whose un
defaultemployment rates are
default above 25%.
default 
defaultThis is linked to the submission of the implementation plan to the European Commission.
default 
defaultThis is the status, I would say. 
defaultThe Chairman:default Do you think that it is going to improve?
default 
defaultHas it been instrumental in getting a move on in terms 
defaultof
default the opportunities for these people who have been unemployed for four months? 
defaultMr Mascherinidefault: Yes.
default Data is available from
default the evaluation of 
defaultthe Finnish Youth Guarantee, which
default is the model that is taken as an example.
default From that we see that the first development plan was
default carried out for 93% of young people within two weeks of their
default registration with
default the Public Employment Services.
default 
defaultAfter three months
default,
default 72% of young people who partic
defaultipated in this programme were no longer unemployed
default.
default 
defaultHalf of them 
defaultwere in the labour market, 20% were
default in education or training, but there is no data for the remaining 30% who
default have
default disappear
defaulted
default from the statistics.
default 
defaultThis is an official
default evaluation by
default the Finnish Government, and I w
defaultould be happy to share the source of that with you.
defaultThe Chairman:default That would be very kind and very helpful.
default 
defaultYou feel slightly optimistic but
default you are
default still worrying about
default those who do not have anything. 
defaultDid
default you say 
default30% or 13%?
defaultMr Mascherinidefault: Slightly above 30% disappear
default.
default 
defaultFurther research on those for whom there 
defaultis no information is
default crucial in order to fully understand the effectiveness of these guarantees, even though the numbers are positive in comparison to other programmes.
defaultMs Hadjivassilioudefault: Similar
defaultly
default to the Finnish results
default, an
default evaluation
default of the 
defaultYouth Guarantee scheme in 
defaultSweden
default has
default shown that participants find a job faster than a control group
default which does
default not have the support of the Youth Guarantee.
default We have some data from
default 
defaultAustria
default and,
default although there is a high dropout rate from their 
defaultparticipants, of those 
defaultwho participate
defaultd
default in the Youth Guarantee in 2010
default,
default 
defaultabout 58% 
defaultfound a job after three
default months
default and
default 63% found a job after 12 months
default.
defaultThat said, my 
defaultconcern—and not only my concern,
default commentators h
defaultave mentioned this—
defaultis the amount available, the 
default€6 billion.
default It is welcome
default but
default,
default given the magnitude of the problem
default, it is considered in
default some quarters to be insufficient.
default 
defaultFor example, the ILO have estimated that for a proper implementation of the Y
defaultouth Guarantee one would need €
default21 billion, so you can see 
defaultthe difference. 
defaultThe Chairman:default Goodness gracious
default, t
defaulthe difference between €6 billion and €21 billion. 
defaultMs Hadjivassilioudefault: Yes, but that is an ILO estimate.
default 
defaultI am just saying
default that those are
default 
defaultthe 
defaultarguments that are
default out
default there at the moment.
defaultThe Chairman:default There i
defaults 
defaultjust
default one poi
defaultnt I want to
default clarify before I forget it.
default 
defaultWhat is the dropout rate?
default 
defaultYou said the dropout rate. 
defaultMs Hadjivassilioudefault: I do not have it here but I can send it to the Committee.
default That was for 
defaultAustria
default.
defaultThe other thing is 
defaultthat the Eurofound study on the
default Youth Guarantee shows that there are some critical factors for the success of the Youth Guarantee, one of which is capacity, Public Employment Services capacity, quality of advice and number of advisers.
default 
defaultThere is a big discrepancy in the capacity of Public Employment Services across the EU
default,
default as you can imagine.
default The Youth E
defaultmployment 
defaultI
defaultnitiative
default is front
defaultloaded for 2014 and 2015
default. I do not know whether there
default is enough space to develop the capacity in member states if it is not adequate.
defaultAlso, in a number of member states the Youth Guarantee is delivered through the Public Employment Service
defaults
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe coverage of young people who
default are supported by the Public Employment Service
defaults
default also varies across the EU.
default 
defaultIn 
defaultLithuania
default it is 
default25% of young people.
default 
defaultWhat will happen to the
default other
default 75% of young people?
default T
defaulthere are these issues.
default 
defaultI am sure they are going to be 
defaultironed out but tho
defaultse are
default the issues at the moment
default.
defaultThe Chairman:default Do you have 
defaultanything
default to add to that, Professor Simmons? 
defaultProfessor Simmonsdefault: Yes.
default 
defaultThe ILO have done quite a good report on this, called 
defaultStudies on Growth with Equity
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthey look at the Finnish and 
defaultSwedish Youth Guarantee and provide some case studies of how that operates.
default 
defaultI can forward that to you.
defaultThe main thing it
default is useful to think through is what that guarantee consists of.
default Evidence shows that if the
default guarantee consists of labour market reintegration it is likely to be more successful than concentration on education and training.
default 
defaultF
defaultor example, the Swedish and 
defaultFinnish model concentrates on reintegrating back into the workplace.
default 
defaultFurther afield there are similar schemes in 
defaultAustralia
default and 
defaultNew Zealand
default that
default concentrate mainly on reintegration into education
default, and success rates are 
defaultsignificantly worse, below 50%.
defaultThe other thing th
defaultat is quite interesting is 
defaultthe delivery models.
default 
defaultIn 
defaultAustralia
default and 
defaultNew Zealand
default that is a highly marketised system, in many ways similar to many of the support services in 
defaultEngland
default, with quite a lot of competition and duplication.
default 
defaultThat appears to be less successful than the Nordic model with the Public Employment Service.
defaultQ111 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default In 
defaultFinland
default and 
defaultSweden
default how are the jobs created in order to give them to the people who are being looked after?
default I can see that in
default education
default government can do that and 
defaultin p
defaultublic services g
defaultovernment
default can do that to a certain extent
default, but h
defaultow are the jobs created for 
defaultpeople to occupy? 
defaultMr Mascherinidefault: In the Finnish Youth Guarantee the jobs
default basically
default are not created but employers are helped in hiring young people through incentiv
defaultes. E
defaultach young person who participates in the programme and is thought to be ready for the labour market is provided
default with
default a voucher.
default 
defaultIt is called
default a
default Sanssi
default card and it 
defaultremoves part of the salary
default from
default the employer for a certain amount of time.
default 
defaultThe par
defaultt that is removed is different for an apprenticeship or 
defaulta real job.
default 
defaultThere is data showing that after the voucher 
defaultexpires
default, most of those who
default have started a
default work relationship keep the work relationship alive, so they remain in the labour market after the conclusion of the voucher.
defaultQ112 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Clinton-Davis:default After the change of Government in 
defaultAustralia
default, do you anticipate any changes so far as this policy is concerned? 
defaultProfessor Simmonsdefault: It is difficult to say.
default 
defaultI do not think there will be radical changes because I think broadly the new Government has a quite similar outlook generally to the old one, so I would not see them shifting towards a more Finnish or Swedish model. 
defaultThe Chairman:default That is an interesting point.
default 
defaultDo you think that in even in countries where
default the Government and O
defaultpposition are quite opposed to one another in a fundamental
default way 
defaultthey come together with youth unemployment because it is a general worry to everybody? 
defaultProfessor Simmonsdefault: I suppose if you look at the Anglophone nations in particular, with varying degrees, largely policies within a neo-liberal framework—and there is the emphasis mainly on supply side rather than demand—the Nordic countries have mediat
defaulted that to some degree and 
defaulttheir policies
default have
default stimulated demand more than the Anglophone nations. 
defaultQ113 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Hooper:default I want
default to come back to the Finnish example that you quoted and the 30% who did not continue in the scheme, who disappeared from the scheme.
default 
defaultWhat is the difference between that and being a dropout?
defaultMr Mascherinidefault: There is
default one-
defaultthird for which they have no data, so they do not kn
defaultow if they became self-employed or if they are at work but there is
default no record.
default 
defaultThis is the difference between the dropouts
default, 
defaultbecause among them there can be
default a
default part that is a dropout and another part that maybe is at work but there is no record because data has 
defaultbeen discontinued
default. 
defaultThe Chairman:default The black economy, we call it here. 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default Are there any other Europe
defaultan countries offering 
defaultsubsidies
default, effectively
default?
default 
defaultThe vouchers are subsidies, are they not? 
defaultMr Mascherinidefault: I think there are other countries that offer incentives or subsidies.
default 
defaultOne is 
defaultSweden
default and then maybe you have other data.
default 
defaultAnother thing, for example, is negative incentives.
default 
defaultThis is a measure that I found in 
defaultFrance
default where large companies need to have 4% of their labour force as apprentices.
default 
defaultIf they do not have this 4%, if they have a lower share, their taxes are raised for that figure.
default 
defaultThese are negative incentives that are the opposite of the positive i
defaultn some sense
default. 
defaultQ114 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Fearn:default The European Social Fund and the additional funds from the Youth Employment Initiative are the main financial contributions to tackling youth unemployment at a European level.
default 
defaultWhat in your view are the ways in which member states have used ESF 
defaultto address the current problems
default and are proposing to use these instruments in the new programming in the new period?
default 
defaultWhat value do they add, if any? 
defaultMs Hadjivassilioudefault: T
defaulthe ESF has supported polic
defaulties targeted
default at unemployed young people in a variety of ways.
default 
defaultThe main types of polici
defaultes can be summarised as those
default that are aimed at preventing early school leaving.
default 
defaultThere are some successful examples like the second-chance schools across Europe
default,
default and in 
defaultFrance
default in particular
default that has
default very good reintegration rates.
default 
defaultHowever, 
defaultthere is concern even from the C
defaultommission that the availability of data
default and
default monitoring needs to be improved for the policies that target early school leaving.
default 
defaultAlso we need to know more, even after all these
default years of
default doing research in this area, about the drivers of early school leaving.
defaultThe other types of policies are to promote the skills that are relevant to the labour market in a variety of ways, like curricula reforms.
default A
defaultt the moment
default 
defaultPoland
default is und
defaultergoing a major curricula reform
default to link learning outcomes to employer requirements.
default 
defaultCyprus
default 
defaultis undergoing
default a major curricula reform as well
defaultThe other area is supporting first work experience and on-the-job training, for the simple reason that employers across 
defaultEurope
default repeatedly say that one of the major barriers to them employing a young person 
defaultis lack of work experience. T
defaulthere is a big push towards traineeships
default—internships in the 
defaultUK
default; t
defaultraineeship is
default the c
defaultommission-speak for internship
defaults
default and work experience placement
default—and t
defaulthere is a big push for apprenticeships.
defaultThe third one is improving access to the labour market for the first job, through subsidies and voucher schemes
default,
default and 
defaultpromotion of entrepreneurship and
default self-employment among young people.
default 
defaultThere are a number of programmes supporting this.
defaultYou can imagine that the effectiveness is mixed
default because
default of this wide range of policies in a 
defaultwide ran
defaultge of countries
default.
default 
defaultThere are some examples wher
defaulte it has been very effective. A
defaultpprenticeship schemes
default, if they are well designed, 
defaulttend to be very effective in a particular context.
default 
defaultWe have just finished an EU-wide overview of apprenticeships and trai
defaultneeships across 
defaultEurope
default for the 
defaultC
defaultommission, and we saw that the labour market int
defaultegration rate ranges between 
default60% to even 90% in some cases.
default 
defaultTraineeships can be effective, but less so unless they are well designed and targeted.
default 
defaultAgain
default,
default the integration rate ranges, but there the lowest is 35% and the 
defaulthighest
default&#xad;
default—
defaultif it is to do with 
defaultgraduates, not surprisingly—
defaultcan be 90%.
default 
defaultMy point is that effectiveness is not black or white, it is mixed
default,
default and it depends on the particula
defaultr context of implementation, co
default-
defaulto
defaultrdination and also employer buy-
defaultin.
defaultMr Mascherinidefault: Member states have used ESF, as Kari said, through three main ways.
default 
defaultOne is investment in education and training that can be preventing or reintegrating early school leavers or providing training.
default 
defaultIn this regard, from 2007 to 2012 20 million young people under 25 benefited from the ES
defaultF through the participation in one of these
default programmes.
default 
defaultIn some countries young people account for almost
default half of all the participants in
default ESF activities.
default 
defaultA good pract
defaultice in the 
defaultUK
default, for example, is the
default hothouse project in 
defaultCornwall
default that aims at
default preventing early school leaving.
defaultThe other strand of activities is to bridge the gap between education and the labour market
default through various activities such as 
defaultindividual career guidance, apprentice
defaultship, fostering mobility or through helping young peopl
defaulte to set up their own business
default.
default These are the sort
default of 
defaultESF 
defaultactivities that have been used by the member states.
defaultIn recent years there is evidence that approximately €16 billion has been reallocated in t
defaulthe chapter of employment in order to speed up the access of young people into the l
defaultabour market in training and 
defaultemployment.
default 
defaultThis is expected to help around 1 million young people in 
defaultEurope
default and 55,000 small companies.
defaultG
defaultiving a chance to all young people is another area where member states have used the ESF, especially for removing practical and logistic
defaultal barriers for
default the most vulnerable, 
defaultfor example the Danish Hold on Tight Caravan p
defaultroject.
default 
defaultThat helps to support
default 
defaultthe integration of those with an immigration
default background into
default society.
default 
defaultThis has contributed to
default a
default decrease
default in 
defaultschool leaving from 20% to below 14%
default,
default more or less.
defaultFinally
default,
default the future.
default 
defaultI think that
default these
default instrument
defaults
default, the youth employment i
defaultnitiatives and the ESF
default,
default will be potentially used for the implem
defaultentation of the Youth Guarantee
default because it guarantees a longer-term programme.
default 
defaultIt is a national commitment, so member states have to finance the Youth Guarantee and the budget.
default 
defaultThe European Commission can top up the Youth Guarantee through the Youth Employmen
defaultt Initiatives and the ESF.
default 
defaultThe youth employment i
defaultnitiatives that are the €6 billion will be used for programmes that are linked to individuals, such as vouchers for training apprenticeships or financial support to help young people to set up t
defaultheir own busi
defaultness
default.
default 
defaultConversely, the ESF 
defaultstill would be used
default for the individual but also to promote
default and support
default structural reform in the countries
default, for example education, 
defaultthe Public Employment Services and job search strategies, at least in 
defaultthe member states that need it
default. 
defaultThe Chairman:default Do you think there is a confusion between the two?
default 
defaultIs it right to have two or could they not be consolidated?
default 
defaultGoing back to the question that Lord Fearn asked, what value do they add? 
defaultMr Mascherinidefault: I think t
defaulthe value that they add
default 
defaultis
default that 
defaultthey provide the opportunity to implement the new programmes, for example. 
defaultProfessor Simmonsdefault: 
defaultI j
defaultust 
defaulthave 
defaulta couple of points to add.
default 
defaultIn some ways it is a difficult question to answer because it is a highly variable situation between different European nations.
default 
defaultSuccess or otherwise relates very much to individual state-level policy.
default 
defaultT
defaulthat is one difficulty in answering the question.
default 
defaultThe other difficulty is that in many ways it is quite early in the process to evaluate it.
default 
defaultTraineeships were mentioned earlier.
default 
defaultIn the 
defaultUK
default context in particular, that is a very recent development, so it is quite hard to say.
defaultOne general observation 
defaultis
default that
default entrepreneurship and so on has probably been done less well through this initiative than it could be.
default In particular in
default the 
defaultUK
default context, historically we did this quite well.
default 
defaultI am thinking of things like the Enterprise Allowance Scheme, an MSC programme back in the 1980s, that was really quite successful and many businesses that exist today were brought on through that as seed corn.
default 
defaultMy impression is that that particular element
default of this
default initiative is perhaps not as well developed as the education and training initiatives and so on.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultIt is p
defaultrobably too formulaic and does not allow for the inspiration
default and the pizazz.
defaultQ115 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Valentine:default Forgive me if you have touched on this already.
default 
defaultIt is following on in the same vein.
default 
defaultAll the things you have listed that are being done by member states you would have thought any self-respecting member state would do with or without European involvement.
default 
defaultIs there a redistributive point in here?
default 
defaultIs one trying to get more cash from the north to the south or the south
default-
defaultwest to the east, and/or is there a best-practice transfer?
default 
defaultIs it just a money point?
default 
defaultAre we trying to add some more money to what the member states would be paying anyway, and is that not just pooling the money and putting it back out again?
default 
defaultWhere is the slice of added value? 
defaultMs Hadjivassilioudefault: I do not know whether my answer will satisfy you, bu
defaultt 
defaultit is definitely the case that the user base varies across the 
defaultEU
default and for the southern European countries
default.
default I am Greek
default so I should know
default that
default.
default 
defaultAlso
default for the eastern European 
defaultcountries and some smaller countries
default like 
defaultMalta
default, 
defaultthe European Social Fund in 
defaultgeneral has
default been a key driver in developing policies in areas where there was no money or even no policy expertise.
default So there has been a transfer of learning from countries that are more developed in certain areas to others, especially in the youth employment area and social inclusion. In that sense, there is a transfer of learning. On the other hand
default,
default learning is two ways, so I was surprised when I read recently—not for youth unemployment—that the German Labour Inspectorate was totally reorganised after a peer review visit in another country. Learning is two ways. I would not like to think that it is only that the northern European countries teach the other countries how to do things. 
defaultThere are other kinds of learning, for example through the European Mutual Learning Programme and the peer reviews that exist. There was a recent one in 
defaultthe Hague
default at the end of November where the countries presented their policies and there was a synthesis paper. There is a lot of interaction in learning so I would not like to minimise the importance of the ESF and the structure of funds, but it is not just the money, it is the whole learning and exchange of experience process that goes with it.
defaultBaroness Valentine:default Is there a trend to give the money to the newer countries?
defaultMs Hadjivassilioudefault: The allocation of funds depends on the need. Also the ESF is helping the 
defaultUK
default. For example, TAPS is an apprentice scheme in the 
defaultUK
default that is funded by the ESF, so it is not just that the money goes to the eastern European countries.
defaultThe Chairman:default You have a huge amount of information available in your head. Do you think that you could share it with us, not now because we obviously have a time limit today?
defaultMs Hadjivassilioudefault: Yes, by all means.
defaultThe Chairman:default If you could
default give us another example, like 
defaultyou gave us from 
defaultthe Hague
default, 
defaultit would be most helpful.
defaultMs Hadjivassilioudefault: Yes, we can definitely
default do that, and
default I am very happy to.
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you very much. Also
default let me say to
default the two other witnesses, if you feel that there is some experience that you suddenly think about that could
default shed
default some light

defaultQ116 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Freeman:default My question is to Professor Simmons. If we could look back now over the last 50 years—you very helpfully have just mentioned one lesson that we could learn—are there other lessons that we can learn from past recessions and past high levels of youth unemployment?
defaultProfessor Simmonsdefault: Yes, I think there are lessons that can be learned. Each recession has a disproportionately large effect upon young people. Although it affects the population in general, the effect upon young people is deeper. The way that successive Governments have tried to address that, particularly since the 1970s, has been largely through focusing on the supply side. Education and training of various sorts is, of course, very important. However, it is only part of the equation and I think largely the demand side has been neglected. Where deman
defaultd-
defaultside initiatives have been tried, I think they have been relatively successful. I look back to some of the MSC programmes, which at the time were highly criticised. For example, the community programme was a nationwide MSC-funded programme that stimulated the demand for labour and provided work-based learning for trainees on it.
defaultI guess that is the main thing, although the other thing to say is that in some ways it is a false dichotomy to talk about a division between supply side and demand side because the tw
defaulto things interact. Poor-quality work and poor-
defaultquality training can have a deleterious effect upon young people and discourage them from further labour market engagement. There needs to be a concentration on quality because poor
default-
defaultquality provision, whether that is in the workplace or education and training, can in some ways be more damaging than waiting for something that is more suitable.
defaultLord Freeman:default Very helpful, thank you.
defaultQ117 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Clinton-Davis:default You have referred to the situation that persists in other European Union countries. I am concerned about the approach in this country. Do you think what the Government is doing is effective, relevant, can be improved?
defaultProfessor Simmonsdefault: I am happy to answer that. I think there are some things to be praised, for example the promotion of apprenticeships is broadly a good thing but the way that it is being delivered in many ways is highly problematic. Many of the programmes labelled as apprenticeships stretch the meaning of the term beyond reality and the quality is highly variable. So the principle of increasing apprenticeships is really good but the practice is problematic. 
defaultOther than that, I think there are three problems with the 
defaultUK
default approach. One I have menti
defaultoned already, which is the over
defaultconcentration on 
defaultthe 
defaultsupply side and the lack of recognition that supply and demand interacts. Another area that is problematic is a marketised system of delivery, particularly for education and training. For example, within one local authority you could have 100 providers of education and training programmes, public, private, voluntary sector, charitable organisations and so on. I think for young people and their parents that is a very difficult mishmash to see through and to negotiate. Also organisations competing against each other for business sometimes works very well but on the ground that can be problematic for young people who are put on programmes that are sometimes not suitable because the funding is attached to the young person as a unit of resource. So I think the marketised thing is problematic.
defaultLord Clinton-Davis:default Are these points raised in the debates that occur about the issue in 
defaultEurope
default? Are we doing something quite unique as far as this is concerned? Is it being followed by other people?
defaultProfessor Simmonsdefault: I do not think it is unique. There is highly variable practice in the different European nations although in many ways the 
defaultUK
default context is more similar to other Anglophone nations, for example 
defaultAustralia
default and 
defaultNew Zealand
default. If you look at how well the 
defaultUK
default is doing, in a way it is EU average, so okay, but in reality the 
defaultUK
default is doing much worse in terms of youth unemployment than the countries that it would traditionally compare itself to, particularly 
defaultGermany
default. It depends how you look at it but, compared to 
defaultBritain
default’s traditional industrial rivals, it is doing relatively badly.
defaultThe third point is that the other problem with the 
defaultUK
default approach is coercion. I think there is a balance to be had between carrot and stick. I am not a hopeless romantic, some young people do need to be robustly encouraged; the minority as well by the way but there are some. However, if they are encouraged into low
default-
defaultquality provision
default,
default that will have a further deleterious effect. That would be my overall observation of the 
defaultUK
default context.
defaultQ118 default&#xa0; 
defaultTdefaulthe Chairman: defaultThank you very much. Do you think that the 
defaultUK
default approach is consistent in other EU countries, a similar sort of approach, or are we doing things so differently that maybe this is why the differences come up between 
defaultUK
default and 
defaultGermany
default?
defaultProfessor Simmonsdefault: The 
defaultUK
default system is very different to 
defaultGermany
default. For example, I mentioned apprenticeships earlier and people are probably aware of the traditional German system of apprenticeship, and also 
defaultAustria
default. Other northern European nations are much more robust than the 
defaultUK
default system. I think there are some qualitative differences there.
defaultThe Chairman:default Going though this today, I have the feeling that there are many initiatives and not all of them can be of the same value. What are the better ones? Lord Kakkar, you would like to come into that.
defaultQ119 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Kakkar:default You mentioned a few moments ago that the approaches are quite different and youth unemployment has been a particular feature of every recession and the responses are different in different member states. Has the recovery of the youth element from those recessions also been different across 
defaultEurope
default? Cumulatively, recession after recession, has the position of youth employment in this country been left at a particular disadvantage in comparison to the rest of 
defaultEurope
default as the member states come out of recession?
defaultThe Chairman:default Sorry, we have not given you notice of that question but I am sure you can deal with it.
defaultProfessor Simmonsdefault: Again, it is variable. The condition of youth unemployment in the Mediterranean states is much worse than that in the 
defaultUK
default. I think that is related to some degree to socio-historical traditions and particular labour markets or the absence of a solid youth labour market that used to exist in the 
defaultUK
default. Youth unemployment levels in 
defaultGermany
default, 
defaultBelgium
default, 
defaultFinland
default and so on have held up much better than those of the 
defaultUK
default since 2008. There is evidence, looking at all these dimensions, that there is good practice to spread. The evidence is there, but I think 
defaultit is difficult to get certain G
defaultovernments to recognise that.
defaultLord Kakkar:default Does that mean that in times of economic growth we have a structurally weaker youth employment market as a result of a previous lack of attention?
defaultProfessor Simmonsdefault: Yes, that would be my observation. In particular in the 
defaultUK
default what we are getting is many adult workers competing for what was traditionally youth employment, so trading down and squeezing young people out of what were, essentially, pockets of the youth labour market. That is a particular feature of the 
defaultUK
default that is quite observable.
defaultThe Chairman:default May I just remind everybody that we are now running out of time. We have about 15 minutes left so
default would you
default keep the answers quite short.
defaultQ120 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Hooper:default A quick supplementary, which to some extent we have bypassed: when you first referred to the broad definition of apprenticeships in the 
defaultUK
default as being not an advantage, what would be your preferred definition?
defaultProfessor Simmonsdefault: Just to put a little flesh on the bones, for example calling a six-month programme in a retail outlet an apprenticeship is extremely different to a robust
default three-year programme with high-
defaultlevel qualifications, let us say within Rolls-Royce or British Aerospace. I think there needs to be a definition about level, length and content. That could be debated but I think at the moment it is too fluid.
defaultMs Hadjivassilioudefault: In response to a previous question, a distinctive characteristic of the crisis that we have had in the last few years—and Massimiliano can correct me—is that it affected graduates, highly skilled young people, much more than in previous recessions. I was just checking the latest figures for NEET in Europe and for young pe
defaultople with upper secondary, post-
defaultsecondary and tertiary education levels—the so-called more skilled than the usual group of NEETs we tend to associate with—over 50% are classified as NEETs in countries such as the UK, the southern European countries, Ireland, Sweden, the Baltic countries, Czech Republic and the rest of it. I think there is an issue around also the highly skilled because the policy focus is usually NEETs and we feel that the general youth population, especially the highly skilled ones, will integrate more easily. But after this recession things are not like in the past so graduates find it difficult to integrate in a number of countries.
defaultThe Chairman:default The graduates who several years ago knew they had jobs at the end of their degree and that is not the case now? 
defaultMs Hadjivassilioudefault: Yes.
defaultThe Chairman:default Yes, I think that we do have evidence of that.
defaultMr Mascherinidefault: I would like to just briefly enter into the discussion. Responses to youth unemployment have been different in Europe because the problems of the member states are different in 
defaultEurope
default. For example, in some member states the crisis has exploded youth unemployment but the labour market was already difficult before for young people. If we analyse, for example, the population of NEETs, they have very different characteristics among member states, even in countries with similar rates. For example, 
defaultin 
defaultSpain
default and 
defaultItaly
default—I am Italian—they have similar NEETs rates but the population is completely different. In 
defaultSpain
default the population of NEETs has increased as a result of the crisis, so the majority of NEETs are unemployed males with work experience. On the other hand, in 
defaultItaly
default the majority of NEETs are inactive females without work experience because there was a problem of youth accessing the labour market even before the crisis. It is more a structural problem than a problem related to the crisis and this has created different responses to the crisis.
defaultQ121 default&#xa0; 
defaultEarl of defaultLiverpooldefault:default There seem to be so many different situations in different countries that you are telling us abou
defaultt and obviously there is no one-size-
defaultfits
default-
defaultall solution, but we are trying to write a report on how to resolve the situation. If you were writing the report for us, what magic wand could one use to produce an idea to get everybody singing off the same hymn sheet?
defaultThe Chairman:default A nice quick answer, please.
defaultProfessor Simmonsdefault: To anybody in particular? I will give you an answer then. There is no silver bullet. However, what individual nation states and the EU need to do is to develop a coherent industrial strategy, and by that I do not mean trying to reopen shipyards and coal
default 
defaultmines that were closed 30 years ago. There are different ways of doing industrial strategies and different nation states need to think that through. For example, in the 
defaultUK
default we need an industrial stra
defaulttegy for green, renewable, high-
defaulttech infrastructure projects, housing and so on, so my answer would be for the supply and the demand side to interact. That is far harder to implement than it is to say, but I suppose that would be my vision.
defaultMr Mascherinidefault: It is a $1 million question, but I think that we can be as creative as we want with our supply side initially, the training, retraining, fostering apprenticeship or integrating early school leavers and apprenticeship and intern
defaultship, but if we do not have jobs how, after six months of training, do 
defaultwe tell our young people that there is more training for the next six months
default?
default So supply side measures are important as well.
defaultMs Hadjivassilioudefault: To reinforce what the previous speakers said, as we are doing this over youth apprenticeships I was speaking to the Public Employment Services in 
defaultGreece
default and 
defaultCyprus
default and they said to me, “Apprentices are free to employers. We pay everything”. They do not want them because they are not sure whether they will have a business in a year’s time, and maybe this is the extreme case but this is the need for balance of supply and demand.
defaultThe Chairman:default Yes, I can understand that. Lord Clinton-Davis, do you want to ask your question? No. If you have an answer to that prepared perhaps you could let us have it because we are up against the pipes, You have just been too interesting.
defaultQ122 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default I think my question, which again is about the balance between supply and demand, has been answered to a fair degree already, but I have an additional point to make. One of the traditional ways in the public service in the past in the 
defaultUK
default was to retire people at 65 or 60 to create opportunities to bring young people in. Now with the changed legislation on retirement policy and people having to stay longer and older people competing for jobs in the market, we have a difficulty there in the 
defaultUK
default. Is that common in other parts of Europe, where I believe they still have rather earlier retirement ages in some of the European countries than we have in the UK, or is there freedom for people to argue that they can stay on as long as they wish regardless of what the public policies are on retirement age?
defaultMr Mascherinidefault: In most European countries now there is the tendency to increase the minimum age that people can 
defaultretire at
default, for budgetary reasons as well. I think that there is conflicting evidence about the effect of increasing retirement age on the share of young people who are at work. We have observed that during this recession older workers have suffered the crisis in a very marginal way in comparison to the other age categories. We do not know basically because, for example, those countries that have a higher share of older workers are also those with a higher share of young people at work, so it is more general and broader labour market participation. However, for certain types of jobs there is no replacement of an older worker for a young worker. For other jobs, as you indicate, there is an increase in older workers being competitive in the labour market, but there is no conclusive evidence on that because we can find studies that indicate opposite directions.
defaultQ123 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default Can I ask, if the demand side is the answer
default,
default what is the responsibility of employers? A quick response, please, or you could even think about it and write t
defaulto us. Would that be all right? I am talking about t
defaulthe responsibility of employers if the real problem is on the demand side.
defaultProfessor Simmonsdefault: I could give you a very quick response. I think largely employers are the missing voice in this. We talk about education, training, state policy and so on but I think largely the employer voice is missing, with some exceptions, some noble exceptions by the way.
defaultThe Chairman:default It is interesting you should say that because we have had some really cracking evidence from some employers, but there are always good eggs.
defaultProfessor Simmonsdefault: Yes, absolutely.
defaultMs Hadjivassilioudefault: It depends again which country we are talking about. There are countries where employers are very much present, and I am not going to mention the Germans,
default who are
default the usual suspect
defaults
default here. For example, in 
defaultLuxembourg
default a very successful traineeship programme, with over 85% of labour market integration rate, was intro
defaultduced on the initiative of the Chambers of C
defaultommerce and it was designed with the Public Employment Services in close co
default-
defaultoperation with the employers. I think if employers see young people as the investment for the future then you see the whole thing on a different footing.
defaultMr Mascherinidefault: There is variability among the member states because, for example, in Scandinavian countries Youth Guarantees are a partnership between public, private and people, and employers play their role. Also in 
defaultGermany
default and 
defaultAustria
default there is the question, “Why do you offer apprenticeships?” because we do. It is in our tradition to play our role there. This is a complement and it is important.
defaultQ124 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Hooper:default I think the evidence base about how youth employment should best be tackled and where the gaps in knowledge are has been pretty well covered, but is there anything you would wish to add, perhaps particularly in terms of gaps in knowledge?
defaultMr Mascherinidefault: In our studies we found some gaps in evaluation of those programmes that try to involve the filters from the labour markets, so multiple disadvantages that require a multiple approach that is not just the integration into labour market but also at the beginning management schemes and then labour market schemes. We found a lack of evidence for those kind of programmes in some cases.
defaultMs Hadjivassilioudefault: In our overview, it is not about content although content is an issue. For example, existing evidence shows that active labour market policies targeted at young people tend to perform less well in general across the EU than programmes for adults. I think there is a need for further exploration especially with training, but at the more general level, impact evaluations are missing, proper rigorous impact evaluations. We have monitoring data, like so many people took part in that programme, so many people finished the programme, but in terms of labour market outcomes—and I was struck as we were doing the overview this year—I expected to find a lot of impact evaluations and, especially after the six months, how many young people who took part in this programme were still employed. It is very uneven, very patchy and overall there is a big gap there for proper impact evaluations, counterfactual evaluations and the rest of it.
defaultQ125 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default You have given us a lot of very interesting examples of different practice in different countries in the EU. How valuable is sharing good practice and in the past how effective has it been to do that? A final bit of that, if it is valuable, is what is a way of doing it? Is it useful to pass on good practice? In the past has it been useful? If it is useful, what is the right mechanism for doing it within the European Union?
defaultThe Chairman:default Do
default you want to write to us on that.
defaultMr Mascherinidefault: I can try to answer shortly. There is no need to reinvent the wheel every time. If we have a formal evaluation of good programmes and we know that they work very well, they can serve as inspiration. All member states are different, they have their national context and their own problems, so the successful programmes need to be adapted to the other member states.
defaultHow can we learn from each other? The European Commission has peer reviews of most of our learning programme. It has thematic and multiple-learning programme events. There is the database of good practices. In some sense it is a process that is strengthening every year in order to find new ways of learning from each other. For example, an increasing number of member states have reported to have drawn inspiration from each other in the field of small and medium enterprises, education for apprenticeships and youth apprenticeships. This is the whole communication of the European Commission in that direction. This is just one small example.
defaultThe Chairman:default Quick two-sentence answer.
defaultProfessor Simmonsdefault: It all depends what you mean by best practice. If best practice means creating highly flexible labour markets and pools of labour to pull on, we have best practice within the 
defaultUK
default, because that is what we do. We churn young people through various sites of participation and non-participation. If we are talking about best practice as a model of social justice and high employment, I think we have talked about various examples, various nations where we can draw on good practice. Having said that, I think there is generally a gap between policy and practice.
defaultThe EU is a large unit and set of committees and organisations and so. How that drills down to practice on the front
default 
defaultline, to careers advisers, teachers, training providers, it is creating that link between policymakers and practitioners that is really important.
defaultThe Chairman:default That is very instructive. Thank you all very much indeed. You have really given us of your best and it has been most interesting. You are leaving us confused, at least me confused, not the rest of them I am sure. We are very grateful to you for spending the time and thank you. The last thing I do say is that if there is anything you think we should have asked you please answer it and write to us. Thank you.
