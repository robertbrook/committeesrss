"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Christopher GillWHO  CARES  ?So,\n what are the principles upon which \ntraditional English common law i\ns founded ?\n \nFirstly, that until proven otherwise,\n every person is presumed\n innocent. \nThe \npresumption of  \ninnocence i\ns the \nvery keystone of the British criminal justice system.\nS\necondly, except under the circumstances prescribed\n in the latter day Prevention of Terrorism Act, nobody may have their liberty infringed\n without being charged in open court within 24 \nhours of arrest. Crucially the ‘charge’ has to be backed by \nprima facie\n evidence.\n Even when the suspect is thought to have committed murder\n,\n detention without charge may \nonly be extended, with the permission of magistrates, to a maximum of 96 hours\n. This fundamental principle is enshrined in the law of \nHabeas Corpus \nwhich Archbishop Desmond Tutu once described as being\n \n”such an incredible part of freedom”.\nThirdly,\n the right to\n \ntrial by jury, \noriginating\n \nin \nM\nagna Carta\n,\n forms part of the very bedrock of the British criminal justice system. It\ns significance\n is that it ensures that the defendant can insist that he \nor she \nis effectively ‘tried’ by his \nor her \npeers -\n \n‘\n12 good men and true\n’\n -\n \ndrawn at random from amongst the general public\n and demonstrably \ni\nndependent of \n‘the powers that be’\n who\n might otherwise act in an authoritarian and arbitrary fashion.\nFourthly, until recently that is, it was always held that once a defendant had been acqu\nitted it was unlawful to charge\n \nthat person \nagain \nwith the same offence. \nDouble jeopardy was something that British subjects have heretofore never had to worry about. The view was taken that it was totally unacceptable that a potentially innocent person should forever live under the threat of being dragged through the courts \nagain and again in the circumstances in which the prosecution had failed to establish guilt in the first case\n.\n \nAn unwritten principle of \nthe \nBritish \ncriminal justice system was that it was better that 10 guilty men went free than that one innocent person be hanged\n.\nFifthly, in order t\no avoid the possibility of\n \ndefendant\ns\n being condemned on the strength of thei\nr own testimony the law embraces\n \nthe\n right to silence.\nSixthly\n, the \ninadmissibility of hearsay avoids the pos\nsibility of\n defendant\ns\n being found guilty on the basis of say-so evidence from absent ‘witnesses’.\nSeventhly, the \nwithholding of previous convictions ensures that the hearing of cases brought to court are not prejudiced by the defendant’s previous record\n.\nEighthly, trials \nin absentia, \nin\n other words trials in the absence of the defendant\n,\n have no place in the British criminal justice system\n.\nFinally, we have\n \nreporting restrictions so that whilst matters are \nsub judice\n \nPress reporting is limited so as not to prejudice a fair trial.\nAs can be seen from the foregoing\n,\n the British system of criminal justice has bent over backwards to \nprotect and defend the individual from State inspired coercion. It has been the individual’s sure protection against false accusation, arbitrary arrest and wrongful imprisonment.\nAs we face a future i\nn which the harmonisation of\n criminal justice systems within the European Union looms ever closer it is instructive to note that there is no equivalent of the law of \nHabeas Corpus\n \nin continental Europe, trial by jury is a little known concept and they most certainly don’t start from a position of presumed innocence !\nAs for all the other defences against State coercion that we British enjoy\n,\n in the event of an acquittal, \nthe continental systems \nallow the prosecution to appeal for the defendant to be tried again; a defendant\n’\ns refusal to answer questions is regarded as an admission of guilt; reported or ‘hearsay’ evidence is frequently used to obtain convictions; a defendant’s record, including prosecutions pending, may be read out at the hearing\n; the defendant may be tried without being present in court or, as recently confirmed, without the defendant even being aware of the hearing and, \nnot l\neast, the Press are free to nam\ne names and express opinions both before a\nnd during the course of \na trial.\nAt a time when we stand in extreme\n danger of having the European Court of J\nustice made superior to our own national institutions\n t\nhose of us who were born free, for that is the very nature of our British inheritance, would do well to contemplate the \ncommendable \nwords of Admiral Blake, the chief founder of England’s naval supremacy in the 17\nth\n century\n,\n \nthat “I will have the whole world know that none but an Englishman shall chastise an Englishman”\n.\nThe English common law is what has made us a free people and has kept us a free people – the prospect of surrendering it in favour of criminal justice systems whose \nraison d’etre\n \nis to ensure the supremacy of the State rather than the freedom of the individual is really too awful to contemplate but, be warned and be \nvery \nafraid, that\n is the direction in which your Government is currently taking you.\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
