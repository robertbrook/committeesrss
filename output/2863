defaultThe Women’s League of Burma (WLB) is an umbrella organisation comprising
default thirteen 
defaultwomen’s 
defaultNGOs from different ethnic areas in Burma, embodying the
default federal
default spirit of the 1947 Panglong Agreement.
default 
defaultWLB was founded on 9th December, 1999 with the mission to work for women’s empowerment and the increased participation of women in all spheres of society, particularly peace and national reconciliation processes through capacity building, advocacy, research and documentation. Our constitution mand
defaultates each member organisation
default send representatives to serve in a variety of positions throughout the Congress, Presidium Board, Secretariat, and Pr
defaultogram Coordinators. 
defaultThe activities and expertise of each memb
defaulter organisation is brought into 
defaultcollaborative review through the Presidium board and form the basis of
default nationwide advocacy strategies.
default 
defaultWith multi-ethnic leadership and staffing
default we ensure our vision is balanced by viewpoints from across Burma.

default1) 
defaultDIVERSIFY FOCUS GROUPS:
default 
defaultRecommendation:
default 
defaultIncremental improvements in civil and political rights must not distract from continuing systematic human rights abuses and extreme inequalities in social and economic rights
default, particularly in rural and ethnic areas
default. Changes are largely confined to urban areas and
default the media sphere.
default DfID’s dependence on NGOs based in populous urban centres risks contributing to the uneven development process, strengthening already powerful elites at the expense of those who most need their support. Burma is a complex nation
default of 
defaultdiverse ethnic communities; yet politics continues to be elite Burman driven. DfID must not exacerbate the centralisation of resources by over-focussing on Rangoon or Naypyidaw.
default&#xa0;
default2) 
defaultGENDER: 
defaultSituation:
default 
defaultDfID’s Operational Report 2011-2015 highlights a ‘strong’ focus on women and girls. Yet the programs plans extend to “
defaulttargeted interventions to reduce maternal mortality and increase women’s access to credit”. 
defaultDespite ratifying CEDAW in 1997 Burmese women and girls suffer extensive discrimination, sexual violence, human trafficking and have little to no access to human rights protection or justice.
default 
defaultBurma’s refusal to sign the recent United Nations 
default‘
defaultDeclaration of Commitment to end Sexual Violence in Conflict’
default is a case in point
default. 
defaultWhile women have suffered the worst effects of Burma’s ongoing conflicts they continue to be sidelined from the peace process. Negotiations have not included female representatives at any stage. The government set up Myanmar Peace Centre
default (MPC)
default is all male and there are few women involved in its negotiating partner, the United Nationalities Federation Council (UNFC). 
defaultThis month the USDP encouragingly announced a 
defaultNational Strategic Plan for the Advancement of Women (NSPAW)
default however this requires close mo
defaultnitoring by bodies such as DfID as the National Women’s machinery continues to be run by government organised NGOs (GONGOs).
default&#xa0;

default)
default 
defaultRecommendation:
default 
defaultPolitical empowerment must be a key focus of DfID’s plan to include the other ‘half of the population’.
default 
defaultThis cannot be achieved without support to existing women’s organisat
defaultions that have been sidelined f
defaultr
defaulto
defaultm development funding; how can we expect political empowerment without supporting the very organisations, educational programs and advocacy networks that can enable this?
default Legal changes are essential, the 2008 constitution enshrines impunity for war crimes and bars women from political access; in the meantime 
defaultaid must support
default 
defaultprograms for young female leaders, educational access for women and girls, redress for sexual violence and domestic abuse and promoting women’s access to dec
defaultision-making positions
default.

default4) ESTABLISHED NGOS SIDELINED
defaultSituation:
default 
default Burma does not suffer a dearth of civil society organisations.
defaultA tendency to centralise funding in Yangon and to look to newer organisations means DfID may fail to reach civil society networks that support those most in need. Since 2010 manifold new NGOs have be
defaulten established particularly in R
defaultang
defaulto
defaulton, while encouraging, these green organizations do not have the technical expertise or the geographical reach that established NGOs provide. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5) 
defaultCONFLICT ZONES:
default 
defaultSituation:
default 
defaultCommunities in conflict areas and ‘ethnic states’ have the highest mortality rates and suffer the most extreme levels of poverty; 
defaulta prime example is Kachin state where restrictions on aid were lifted only in June this year (2013). Yet, local relief programs have long been working in Kachin areas:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default6) 
defaultCROSS-BORDER AID:
defaultSituation:
default Df
defaultID has continued to be reluctant to engage with organisations headquartered in the border areas, despite being the predominate location of conflict and hence the gravest human rights abuses, developmental needs and displaced persons. 
defaultDf
defaultID maintains that it has a comparative advantage working with groups inside Burma, even that this brings them closer to the grassroots. This is based on a false assessment that NGOs headquartered in the borders carry out activities there; over 90% of the work of organisations such as KWAT is carried out inside Burma. 
default&#xa0;
default7) 
defaultEXILE MYTH
default:
defaultSituation: 
defaultSidelining cross-border NGOs 
defaultimplies that people fleeing forced conscription, counter-insurgency, victims of rape, people whose villages were inc
defaultinerated or
default families killed are somehow out of touch with Burma’s internal 
defaultsituation. These people are acutely aware of what it means to live under the constant threat of war; from their position of comparative safety NGOs set up in exile have been providing vital support for their communities inside for decades. With headquarters outside of Burma organisations were able to access transnational funding and advocacy in a manner impossible from inside. They continue to document human rights violations and crimes against humanity that groups inside, forced to tread carefully around 
default‘ceasefires’ or ‘peace’ are unable to speak out on
default.
default&#xa0;
default8) 
defaultRecommendation:
default 
defaultDfID 
defaultmust
default look to umbrella or
defaultganizations that bring together
default smaller grassroots NGOs. 
defaultUnlike relying on costly external consultants to map out poten
defaulttial partners or areas of need,
default existin
defaultg networks
default can direct DfID officials to areas of need and relevant NGOs with no requirement for consultation fees.
default 
defaultDue to years of experience such organisations can engage on the kind of consultation level and with the international standards that large funding bodies require
default.  For example; m
defaultost recently WLB
default in partnership with WON (Women’s Organisational Network of Myanmar)
default has brought 
defaultAJAR (Asia Justice and Rights)
default into contact with several of its member organisations to work towards a Survivors of Sexual Violence Network and training program for researchers on sexual 
defaultviolence. This is what the WLB and similar organisations exist
default to do; bring together diverse civil society organisation
defaults working for change in Burma.

default&#xa0;
default3default. What role should DfID play in helping to resolve ethnic tensions?default9) 
defaultUNEVEN DEVELOPMENT/CEASEFIRES:
default 
defaultSituation:
default 
defaultThe focus on ceasefires with ethnic armed forces as a “
defaultsignificant positive development”
default risks overlooking the lack of actual improvement for communities living in ceasefire areas. There are no official monitoring mechanisms for ceasefire accords.  
defaultC
defaultivil society organisations have produced numerous reports outlining how militarized development extends under the cover of ceasefires. In Karen areas: no soldiers have left, land-confiscation and displacement is rife and selective business deals with former ethnic army leaders encourages a corrupt system marginalising the wider community
default. 
default&#xa0;
default10) 
defaultRecommendation:
default 
defaultDfID must ensure that ceasefire agreements 
defaultdo not provide a cloak for destructive
default industrialisation that will produce anew the economic and political marginalisation that lies at the root of many ethnic insurgencies.
default 
defaultP
defaultrograms for ‘capacity building’ have multiplied; 
defaulthowever land confiscation, rapid 
defaultconstruction of dams and power plants ensure 
defaultpeople
default return to areas with little agricultural promise. While the international community 
defaultemphasises ceasefires as the signal of peace, DfID must ensure that this ‘peace’ means sustainable and equitable development
default,
default not merely the silence of guns.
default&#xa0;
default11) 
defaultHUMANITARIAN AID:
default 
defaultRecommendation:
default 
defaultDfID should continue to prioritise desperately needed support for Muslim communities displaced by ongoing violence in 2013. This crucial humanitarian assistance must also extend to other ethnic communities similarly displaced by violence
default and facing denial
default of citizenship rights. 
defaultWith the upcoming Census, DfID’s involvement in mapping out different ethnic communities by accessing local networks excluded from government overviews is essential.
default&#xa0;default4default.default How effectively is DFID working with the FCO and other UK Government Departments, and how might this improve?default&#xa0;default12) IMPUNITY FOR SEXUAL VIOLENCE: 
defaultRecommendation:
default 
defaultThe FCO’s ‘Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative’ needs to be enforced in Burma. DfID and the FCO must work closely together on this. While Hague’s statement that the UK is committed to “
defaultShattering the culture of impunity that surrounds sexual violence in conflict”
default; Burma’s current 2008 constitution includes provisions for Burmese military amnesty. Article 445 states 
default“
defaultNo proceeding shall be instituted against the said Councils or any members thereof or any member of the Government, in respect of any act done in the execution of their respective duties.”
default This enshrined impunity is compounded by Burma’s refusal to sign up to the UN ‘
defaultDeclaration of Commitment to end Sexual Violence in Conflict’
default. 
default&#xa0;
default13) COMMISSION OF INQUIRY:
defaultRecommendation:
default 
defaultDfID and the FCO must work together with the UK Government in pushing for a 
defaultCommission of Inquiry
default into human rights violations, particularly sexual violence. While Burmese women’s organisations and human rights organisations have been documenting the high incidence of rape throughout Burma’s conflicts and decades of military rule a lack of international verification means this evidence is sidelined.
default 
defaultThe coordinated efforts of the FCO, DfID and other UK government departments will be crucial in ensuring these abuses are brought to international attention and that Burmese victims access justice.
