[normal]Written evidence submitted by the [bold]WOMEN’S LEAGUE OF BURMA  (WLB)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Women’s League of Burma (WLB) is an umbrella organisation comprising
[normal] thirteen 
[normal]women’s 
[normal]NGOs from different ethnic areas in Burma, embodying the
[normal] federal
[normal] spirit of the 1947 Panglong Agreement.
[normal] 
[normal]WLB was founded on 9th December, 1999 with the mission to work for women’s empowerment and the increased participation of women in all spheres of society, particularly peace and national reconciliation processes through capacity building, advocacy, research and documentation. Our constitution mand
[normal]ates each member organisation
[normal] send representatives to serve in a variety of positions throughout the Congress, Presidium Board, Secretariat, and Pr
[normal]ogram Coordinators. 
[normal]The activities and expertise of each memb
[normal]er organisation is brought into 
[normal]collaborative review through the Presidium board and form the basis of
[normal] nationwide advocacy strategies.
[normal] 
[normal]With multi-ethnic leadership and staffing
[normal] we ensure our vision is balanced by viewpoints from across Burma.

[normal]1) 
[normal]DIVERSIFY FOCUS GROUPS:
[normal] 
[normal]Recommendation:
[normal] 
[normal]Incremental improvements in civil and political rights must not distract from continuing systematic human rights abuses and extreme inequalities in social and economic rights
[normal], particularly in rural and ethnic areas
[normal]. Changes are largely confined to urban areas and
[normal] the media sphere.
[normal] DfID’s dependence on NGOs based in populous urban centres risks contributing to the uneven development process, strengthening already powerful elites at the expense of those who most need their support. Burma is a complex nation
[normal] of 
[normal]diverse ethnic communities; yet politics continues to be elite Burman driven. DfID must not exacerbate the centralisation of resources by over-focussing on Rangoon or Naypyidaw.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2) 
[normal]GENDER: 
[normal]Situation:
[normal] 
[normal]DfID’s Operational Report 2011-2015 highlights a ‘strong’ focus on women and girls. Yet the programs plans extend to “
[normal]targeted interventions to reduce maternal mortality and increase women’s access to credit”. 
[normal]Despite ratifying CEDAW in 1997 Burmese women and girls suffer extensive discrimination, sexual violence, human trafficking and have little to no access to human rights protection or justice.
[normal] 
[normal]Burma’s refusal to sign the recent United Nations 
[normal]‘
[normal]Declaration of Commitment to end Sexual Violence in Conflict’
[normal] is a case in point
[normal]. 
[normal]While women have suffered the worst effects of Burma’s ongoing conflicts they continue to be sidelined from the peace process. Negotiations have not included female representatives at any stage. The government set up Myanmar Peace Centre
[normal] (MPC)
[normal] is all male and there are few women involved in its negotiating partner, the United Nationalities Federation Council (UNFC). 
[normal]This month the USDP encouragingly announced a 
[normal]National Strategic Plan for the Advancement of Women (NSPAW)
[normal] however this requires close mo
[normal]nitoring by bodies such as DfID as the National Women’s machinery continues to be run by government organised NGOs (GONGOs).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]Recommendation:
[normal] 
[normal]Political empowerment must be a key focus of DfID’s plan to include the other ‘half of the population’.
[normal] 
[normal]This cannot be achieved without support to existing women’s organisat
[normal]ions that have been sidelined f
[normal]r
[normal]o
[normal]m development funding; how can we expect political empowerment without supporting the very organisations, educational programs and advocacy networks that can enable this?
[normal] Legal changes are essential, the 2008 constitution enshrines impunity for war crimes and bars women from political access; in the meantime 
[normal]aid must support
[normal] 
[normal]programs for young female leaders, educational access for women and girls, redress for sexual violence and domestic abuse and promoting women’s access to dec
[normal]ision-making positions
[normal].

[normal]2[bold].[bold] DFID provision of funding and advice to civil society organizations in Burma, particularly for strengthening coalitions, advocacy, research and monitoring capabilities. How successful has this been?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4) ESTABLISHED NGOS SIDELINED
[normal]Situation:
[normal] 
[normal] Burma does not suffer a dearth of civil society organisations.
[normal]A tendency to centralise funding in Yangon and to look to newer organisations means DfID may fail to reach civil society networks that support those most in need. Since 2010 manifold new NGOs have be
[normal]en established particularly in R
[normal]ang
[normal]o
[normal]on, while encouraging, these green organizations do not have the technical expertise or the geographical reach that established NGOs provide. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5) 
[normal]CONFLICT ZONES:
[normal] 
[normal]Situation:
[normal] 
[normal]Communities in conflict areas and ‘ethnic states’ have the highest mortality rates and suffer the most extreme levels of poverty; 
[normal]a prime example is Kachin state where restrictions on aid were lifted only in June this year (2013). Yet, local relief programs have long been working in Kachin areas:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6) 
[normal]CROSS-BORDER AID:
[normal]Situation:
[normal] Df
[normal]ID has continued to be reluctant to engage with organisations headquartered in the border areas, despite being the predominate location of conflict and hence the gravest human rights abuses, developmental needs and displaced persons. 
[normal]Df
[normal]ID maintains that it has a comparative advantage working with groups inside Burma, even that this brings them closer to the grassroots. This is based on a false assessment that NGOs headquartered in the borders carry out activities there; over 90% of the work of organisations such as KWAT is carried out inside Burma. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7) 
[normal]EXILE MYTH
[normal]:
[normal]Situation: 
[normal]Sidelining cross-border NGOs 
[normal]implies that people fleeing forced conscription, counter-insurgency, victims of rape, people whose villages were inc
[normal]inerated or
[normal] families killed are somehow out of touch with Burma’s internal 
[normal]situation. These people are acutely aware of what it means to live under the constant threat of war; from their position of comparative safety NGOs set up in exile have been providing vital support for their communities inside for decades. With headquarters outside of Burma organisations were able to access transnational funding and advocacy in a manner impossible from inside. They continue to document human rights violations and crimes against humanity that groups inside, forced to tread carefully around 
[normal]‘ceasefires’ or ‘peace’ are unable to speak out on
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8) 
[normal]Recommendation:
[normal] 
[normal]DfID 
[normal]must
[normal] look to umbrella or
[normal]ganizations that bring together
[normal] smaller grassroots NGOs. 
[normal]Unlike relying on costly external consultants to map out poten
[normal]tial partners or areas of need,
[normal] existin
[normal]g networks
[normal] can direct DfID officials to areas of need and relevant NGOs with no requirement for consultation fees.
[normal] 
[normal]Due to years of experience such organisations can engage on the kind of consultation level and with the international standards that large funding bodies require
[normal].  For example; m
[normal]ost recently WLB
[normal] in partnership with WON (Women’s Organisational Network of Myanmar)
[normal] has brought 
[normal]AJAR (Asia Justice and Rights)
[normal] into contact with several of its member organisations to work towards a Survivors of Sexual Violence Network and training program for researchers on sexual 
[normal]violence. This is what the WLB and similar organisations exist
[normal] to do; bring together diverse civil society organisation
[normal]s working for change in Burma.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3[bold]. What role should DfID play in helping to resolve ethnic tensions?[bold]9) 
[normal]UNEVEN DEVELOPMENT/CEASEFIRES:
[normal] 
[normal]Situation:
[normal] 
[normal]The focus on ceasefires with ethnic armed forces as a “
[normal]significant positive development”
[normal] risks overlooking the lack of actual improvement for communities living in ceasefire areas. There are no official monitoring mechanisms for ceasefire accords.  
[normal]C
[normal]ivil society organisations have produced numerous reports outlining how militarized development extends under the cover of ceasefires. In Karen areas: no soldiers have left, land-confiscation and displacement is rife and selective business deals with former ethnic army leaders encourages a corrupt system marginalising the wider community
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10) 
[normal]Recommendation:
[normal] 
[normal]DfID must ensure that ceasefire agreements 
[normal]do not provide a cloak for destructive
[normal] industrialisation that will produce anew the economic and political marginalisation that lies at the root of many ethnic insurgencies.
[normal] 
[normal]P
[normal]rograms for ‘capacity building’ have multiplied; 
[normal]however land confiscation, rapid 
[normal]construction of dams and power plants ensure 
[normal]people
[normal] return to areas with little agricultural promise. While the international community 
[normal]emphasises ceasefires as the signal of peace, DfID must ensure that this ‘peace’ means sustainable and equitable development
[normal],
[normal] not merely the silence of guns.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11) 
[normal]HUMANITARIAN AID:
[normal] 
[normal]Recommendation:
[normal] 
[normal]DfID should continue to prioritise desperately needed support for Muslim communities displaced by ongoing violence in 2013. This crucial humanitarian assistance must also extend to other ethnic communities similarly displaced by violence
[normal] and facing denial
[normal] of citizenship rights. 
[normal]With the upcoming Census, DfID’s involvement in mapping out different ethnic communities by accessing local networks excluded from government overviews is essential.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4[bold].[bold] How effectively is DFID working with the FCO and other UK Government Departments, and how might this improve?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]12) IMPUNITY FOR SEXUAL VIOLENCE: 
[normal]Recommendation:
[normal] 
[normal]The FCO’s ‘Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative’ needs to be enforced in Burma. DfID and the FCO must work closely together on this. While Hague’s statement that the UK is committed to “
[normal]Shattering the culture of impunity that surrounds sexual violence in conflict”
[normal]; Burma’s current 2008 constitution includes provisions for Burmese military amnesty. Article 445 states 
[normal]“
[normal]No proceeding shall be instituted against the said Councils or any members thereof or any member of the Government, in respect of any act done in the execution of their respective duties.”
[normal] This enshrined impunity is compounded by Burma’s refusal to sign up to the UN ‘
[normal]Declaration of Commitment to end Sexual Violence in Conflict’
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13) COMMISSION OF INQUIRY:
[normal]Recommendation:
[normal] 
[normal]DfID and the FCO must work together with the UK Government in pushing for a 
[normal]Commission of Inquiry
[normal] into human rights violations, particularly sexual violence. While Burmese women’s organisations and human rights organisations have been documenting the high incidence of rape throughout Burma’s conflicts and decades of military rule a lack of international verification means this evidence is sidelined.
[normal] 
[normal]The coordinated efforts of the FCO, DfID and other UK government departments will be crucial in ensuring these abuses are brought to international attention and that Burmese victims access justice.
