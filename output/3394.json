"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThere are a numerous gaps: \nThe World Economic Forum’s decision in January 2013 to place antibiotic resistance on the global risk register was based upon a handful of studies; these are considered by many to represent an underestimate of the true burden. \nof antibiotic resistant bacterial infections. Whilst data is collected on ambulatory usage, there is no uniform way to collect data across the four UK health administrations and a delay in data provision hinders timely analysis and reporting and of data.  \n&#xa0;\nwhich has the potential to address these deficiencies and provide speedier clinical management of patients but studies to determine the correlation between genotypic and phenotypic tests are required before WGS can be implemented in routine clinical care. Whilst making headline news, the impact in primary and secondary care outside of large well-funded centres of excellence (e.g. ability to interpret WGS data by non-WGS experts in time/cost beneficial manner) needs to be determined.\n&#xa0;\nNo.  Due to multiple mergers between pharmaceutical companies, future development costs vs. other therapeutic areas and perceived no return of investment on antibacterial drugs many companies have left this therapeutic area. As widely reported in the literature and various reports worldwide this has left a huge discovery and development void with no new antibacterial drugs to treat Gram-negative bacterial infections close to the market.  This could be rectified as follows:\n&#xa0;\nregulatory success and obtaining a product licence, expectations that antibiotics are low cost treatments and uncertainties over duration of efficacy before their agents become resistant.   The risks are just too high for some.  Therefore, the research, regulatory and financial models that govern the development and marketing of antibacterial agents need to be reassessed and redefined including consideration, introduction and implementation of (1) Changes to clinical trial design.\nThere are discussions being held at the European Medicines Agency and the USA Food and Drugs Administration that will hopefully bring about changes in the clinical trial paradigm.  An ideal outcome would be new and clear guidelines that mean requisite studies to obtain a licence are feasible and not subject to change during the research and development process, thus helping incentivise companies return to market;  (2) Measures to increase return on investment, such as patent extension, \nto balance the risk benefit ratio companies’ face when developing antibiotics; and (3) Realistic pricing of antibiotics to reflect their true value to society and the economy – breaking the low-cost/on demand expectations and perceptions that surround antibiotic cost and availability.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\ninfection control education, regulation of antimicrobial prescribing, and development of antimicrobial stewardship. In both settings implementation of systematic surveillance for drug-resistant bacteria could potentially provide an early warning system to detect the emergence of new antimicrobial resistances. \n&#xa0;\nThe strategy’s strength is that it identifies and outlines the strategic aims and priorities for action in tackling AMR. The three main weaknesses are that it:\nA BSAC review of the \nDepartment of Health UK Antibiotic Strategy 2000\n revealed over 20 unmet recommendations for action in relation to strengthening systems, initiating research, supporting the development, implementation and measurement of national surveillance and stewardship programmes.  We postulate that the majority of these failed due to lack of infrastructure, IT and the financial resources necessary to take the recommendations forward.  The \nDepartment of Health Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy 2013\n includes many similar, if not the same, recommendations.  Therefore, we recommend that to successfully implement the 2013 strategy the reasons that so many of the 2000 strategy recommendations were not successfully implemented should be established.  We further recommend that the government departments work collaboratively with professional and learned societies in delivering the 2013 strategy to extend on, develop and take forward systems and methodologies that are already in place by stakeholders such as BSAC (e.g. in the UK BSAC is establishing a UK-wide Point Prevalence Survey system to enable the collection and publication of longitudinal data on antimicrobial consumption in hospital settings).  There is not enough time or funding available to “re-invent” the wheel.\n&#xa0;\nIn addition to all points raised above, many of which include recommendations for action, BSAC recommends that to improve and embed in clinical practice, undergraduate and postgraduate education in all healthcare professional courses must include the diagnosis, management and control of infection and the use of antibiotics. \n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
