default concerning the future of the BBC

defaultThe BBC to date ha
defaults
default played an extremely important role within the broadcasting industry in promoting accessibility. The BBC 
defaultis 
defaultthe most accessible broadcaster for people with hearing loss (although there ar
defaulte still improvements they can make)
default and w
defaulte believe the BBC has been fundamental in encouraging other broadcasters to also improve their accessibility
default through demonstrating the possibilities. The BBC has also helped to 
defaultraise expectations amongst deaf people
default 
defaultabout what level of service 
defaultthey can and should expect from all broadcasters. We therefore believe that ensuring everyone has access to BBC services has and should continue to be a key role for the BBC. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is particularly important with the development
default of catch up television and video on demand services, which are not currently regulated in terms of access services. 
defaultAccessibility is not currently explicit within the Public Purposes. However, the Agreement between the BBC and the Secretary of 
defaultState for Culture, Media and Sport does include the requirement to have regard to the need to make services accessible to people
default with a visual or hearing impairment. 
defaultWe welcome the BBCs commitment to provide 100% subtitles on the majority of its programmes. We would like to see the accessibility

defaulting
default further, for example, with the provision of subtitles on online vid
defaulteo clips. 
defaultWe would welcome an explicit statement within the public purposes regarding accessibility. This would help to highlight the importance of ensuring BBC services
default are accessible to disabled people. 
defaultPlease see answer
defaults
default to questions two and three above. 
defaultThe BBC should absolutely retain 
defaultand build on 
defaultits commitment to provide accessible services to ensure that people with hearing loss are able to enjoy TV programmes to the same extent as everyone else. 
defaultWe urge the BBC to ensure that all programmes, whether produced in house or commissioned externally, are accessible to people with hearing loss. This includes ensuring that producti
defaulton staff are aware of the issues around background noise and know how to reduce this. 
defaultBackground noise, such as music, sound effects and ambient noise, can make it difficult for people with hearing loss to follow dialogue during a programme.
default 
defaultIn our 2008 an
defaultnual survey 87% of respondents agreed that background noise affects their ability to hear speech on television.
defaultIt is also important that 
defaultall 
defaultprogrammes are delivered to the BBC 
defaulton schedule, 
defaultwith enough time to produce subtitles in advance of broadcast. 
defaultLi
defaultve subtitles have much higher error rates and therefore 
defaultpre-recorded subtitles are always preferable except for truly live programmes
default. 
defaultNo comment. 
defaultWe believe the BBC should
default play a key role in developing technology. The BBC 
defaultis
default the only broadcaster who ha
defaults
default ensured that subtitles are available on the BBC iplayer when watched through the majority of platforms. 
defaultCurrently no other broadcaster provides this functionality, meaning t
defaulthat deaf people do not have the same access to catch up and video on demand services as other people. 
defaultWe believe this 
defaultpioneering 
defaultrole 
defaultis important, demonstrating to other broadcasters that accessibility is technologically feasible. 
default&#xa0;
defaultConclusiondefaultThe BBC has
default played a pioneering role within the broadcast industry in terms of accessibility for deaf people. We would like to see this role continued and built upon, ensuring that all BBC services are accessible to people with hearing loss, thereby encouraging other
default broadcasters to do the same.
