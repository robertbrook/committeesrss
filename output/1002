defaultBackgrounddefault4.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhen it comes to public understanding of climate science, one recent programme stands out. 
defaultIn 2010,
default we launched a new exhibition, 
defaultatmosphere…exploring climate science
default, and an accompanying programme of exhibitions, installations, events, schools outreach and web content. 
default4.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe mission for the atmosphere exhibition was to ‘Deliver an immersive, enjoyable and memorable (life-enhancing) experience that increases interest, deepens understanding and is robust against deeply held critical convictions’. The exhibition is aimed at families with children aged 8+, KS3 &amp; 4 students and their teachers, and adults (non-subject matter specialists).
default4.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSince opening, the gallery has been visited by over 1.7m visitors. The gallery received 737,000 visitors in its first year, far exceeding its 400,000 visitor target. An estimated 134,000 of these came in education groups. 
default4.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe launched a three-year programme of schools outreach around climate science in 2010. Working with 4 partner museums (National Railway Museum in York, Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester, At-Bristol science centre, Catalyst Science Discovery Centre in 
defaultRuncorn
default) we have engaged 3,193 secondary-school students with issues of climate science and its communication over the course of the project. 
defaultIn the programme’s second year, 
defaultduring
default which participating students produced a magazine called 
defaultATMOS
default, 10,000 copies of the publication were distributed – 
defaultand feedback was received from 
defaultthe then Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, 
defaultCaroline Spelman.
default4.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo accompany the gallery, we launched an online education game about risk management, 
defaultRIZK
default. This appears on 1,306 websites, and has been played 3.3m times since launch. The top countries accessing the game are the US (768,040) and China (492,667), followed by the UK (248,892), enabling us international outreach.
default4.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDetailed content from the gallery is also available on the Museum’s website. To date, t
defaulthis 
defaultClimate Science Info Zone
default has received 122,448 visits and 556,427 pageviews.
default4.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA
default suite of resources for teachers 
defaultwas also launched for 
defaultuse in the classroom. These have been downloaded 27,365 times, and have been reproduced on other sites including 
defaultTES Online
default and 
defaultGuardian Online
default. 
default4.8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe have 
defaultbeen exploring, in conjunction with the British Council 
defaultthe possibility of offering our online conten
defaultt (I
defaultnfo 
defaultZ
defaultones and teaching resources) in 
defaultPortugese.
default4.9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAdditional temporary exhibitions have enabled us to explore climate-related issues in more depth. 
defaultWater Wars
default, a future-looking exhibition showcasing technological solutions to problems of water security, launched in 2012 and received 800,000 visitors.
defaultResponse to the Committeedefault6.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIpsos-MORI research from 2007
default indicated that whilst people viewed climate change as important on a global scale
default,
default it wasn’t as important on a national or local scale. 
default6.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn a 2011 nationwide survey 80% of respondents felt that the world’s climate is changing and 
defaulttwo-thirds
default of respondents were at least fairly concerned. However the same report also highlights that the percentage of people not at all concerned has risen from
default 3% in 2005 to 13% in 2011 (S
defaulthuckburgh et al. 2012)
default6.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEvidence suggests that attitudes and levels of concern are influenced by policy and major climatic events (
defaultIpsos-
defaultMORI 2007; BBC 2010) and that concern about environmental risks fluctuate over time in
default relation to other risks (I
defaultpsos
default-
defaultMORI
default 2007; Weber
default 2010, Eurobarometer 2009). 
defaultP
defaulteople in Europe who 
defaultidentify themselves as being 
defaultinformed about climate change (its causes, consequences and ways of tackling it) are significantly more likely to consider it one of the most significant problems we face today (Eurobarometer 2009). 
default6.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Ipsos
default-
defaultMORI report of 2007 also showed that for the UK population 38% thought that climate change would have a great deal of effect/quite a lot of effect on them personally
default,
default compared to 89% of respondents 
defaultwho thought
default it would have a great deal/quit
defaulte a lot on future generations.
default6.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA report for Defra (COI 2008, cited in Poortinga et al., 2011) indicated that around 1 in 10 young people rejected the notion of human-induced climate change. Our own research 
defaultconducted during
default a 5 year project with teachers also indicated that some teachers are uncomfortable teaching this subject and supporting discussion around it.
default7.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default41% of UK respondents felt they know a fair amount/a lot about climate change (Shuckburgh et al. 2012).
default7.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOf concern, two large surveys found a high proportion of the public believe nuclear power contributes to climate change 
default– 44%
default in the ESRC survey (2003) and 39% in a 2005 survey (Poortinga et al., 2006)
default7.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is evidence that the public don’t understand many key terms 
default– e.g. ‘adaptation’
default, 
default‘
defaultanthropogenic
default’
default, 
default‘a
defaulterosol
default’,
default and are confused by caveats such as ‘may, likely to’ (Dillon &amp; Hobson, 2013; Shuckburgh et al. 2012).
default7.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultResearch indicates that people want to understand more about the science
default and
default the mechanism of climate change rather than just the impacts (
defaultBrehault et al. 2009
default; Shuckburgh et al. 2012).. However, evaluation of visitors post-opening identified a significant barrier 
default–
default 
defaultsome 
defaultpeople 
defaultperceived themselves to be well-informed about certain areas of climate science, even if, objectively, they were not. As a consequence, these visitors did not engage with sections of the exhibition and did not deem the experience to have deepened their understanding (Clipson and Hobson 2011).
default8.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA recent survey by Ipsos
default-
defaultMORI (2012) found that of 1,021 respondents, 66% considered that scientists were the most trusted source of climate change information. In comparison, only 3% of respondents would trust politicians. Similarly
default, quantitative data from 2007 (Ipsos-
defaultM
defaultORI
default) showed that journalists and politicians were the least trusted professions, suggesting implications for communication
default. 
defaultHowever, Shuckburgh et al.’s (2013) large scale survey found that whilst around 
defaultone-third
default of respondents would trust climate scientists to tell the truth about climate change, 
defaultanother third
default wouldn’t trust them to tell the truth.
default8.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultShuckburgh’s research reveals the value people place on hearing directly from those conducting research. The Science Museum regularly runs events in which the public interact directly with scientists, and 
defaultwe 
defaulthave conducted surveys of participants to assess the impact. Of those surveyed, 70% of participants stated that they discussed their experience with someone else after their visit, suggesting the experience was memorable and had a lasting impact. In particular, 31% of online survey respondents reported that their understanding of what scientists do had increased ‘greatly’ as a result of their experience (Paynter 2011).
default In addition, o
defaultur evening Lates programme has run 4 climate-science-themed evenings, engaging over 11,000 adults in total. Speakers at these events have included high profile scientists and policymakers. 
default8.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultShuckburgh’s research also highlights that the poor communication skills of scientists is perceived as a problem amongst the public. Focus group participants cited negative stereotypes such as remoteness as a barrier to their engagement with scientists.
default 
defaultThe Science Museum regularly partners with scientific organisations to share our experience in public engagement, building capacity in communication skills within the next generation of scientists and researchers. Building on the format of a successful public engagement project with early-career engineers in 2012, we are piloting a project in 2013/4 which will provide training opportunities and practical public engagement experience for doctoral students conducting climate research, in partnership with Imperial College’s Grantham Institute and the Climate Change Consortium of Wales.
default9.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA 2009 survey of 2100 Australian and US residents revealed that public trust in museums was ‘second only to science organizations and way ahead of the mainstream media and government as places to communicate climate change and raise awareness of climate change’ (Cameron et al, 2013)
default9.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThese findings are consistent with our research on our own visitors. In 2008, we conducted 6 focus groups with representatives from key target audiences. Participants viewed the Science Museum as a highly appropriate place to provide factual engagement with the issue of climate change. They expected us to provide clear, definitive information about the topic (TWResearch 2008).
default9.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThese focus groups revealed 3 key factors that compromise people’s level of trust in institutions delivering messages around climate change (TWResearch 2008; Dillon and Hobson 2013).
default9.3.1.
default 
defaultHypocrisy. Participants needed institutions to ‘practise what they preach’, and did not want to be told to take actions without evidence of others doing the same.
default9.3.2.
default 
defaultProfit. Participants were highly dubious of information from sources that they perceived to be profiting from the issue. This applied equally to individuals (e.g. a scientist funded by government or business) and to organisations (e.g. a company selling green technologies).
default9.3.3.
default 
defaultInconsistency. Participants expected sources to have a consistent stance, rather than appearing to follow trends.
default9.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn recognition of hypocrisy as a potential barrier to trust among our visiting public, the Museum undertook various measures during the development of the 
defaultatmosphere
default project. These include employing a Sustainability Consultant, and setting up a Carbon Reduction Working Group that reduced the organisation’s carbon footprint by 17% between 2009 and 2010. 
default9.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is our belief the Museum has a responsibility to showcase best practice in sustainability. Our new Hempcrete storage facility at our Wroughton site won Museum and Heritage’s Sustainability award and the Best Workplace New Build category at the Greenbuild Awards. We also aim to generate energy from our sites both for our own use, and to send to the grid. An example of this is the proposed 40MW solar array at the Wroughton site which will provide electricity for around 12,000 homes.
default9.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMindful of profit interests as a potential barrier to trust, full editorial control of content was retained by the Museum – as is the case with all our projects. We were transparent about who funded the project, and a full list of external expert checkers involved was prominently displayed.
default9.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRegarding public mistrust of sources appearing to deliver inconsistent messages, our focus group findings suggested that people struggle to reconcile their understanding of science (objective and fact-based) with the reality that scientists often disagree, and that future climate projections vary. This misunderstanding about the nature of science is widely documented in science communication and science education literature (e.g. Lederman 2007).
default9.8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn our research we found that visitors were largely unaware of the actions 
defaultG
defaultovernment – and business – was taking around climate change. Without understanding this they were reluctant themselves to adopt actions, feeling that whatever they did it couldn’t have the same scale of impact and Participants in visitor focus groups identified a number of barriers to engagement with the subject of climate change (Dillon &amp; Hobson 2013). These included boredom, confusion, powerlessness and fear, and a lack of personal relevance. 
default9.9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBoth the Science Museum’s research and that of Shuckburgh et al.
default(
default2012
default)
default demonstrated the need for clarity in language, use of simple images, need for relevance to the visitor, perceived neutrality; explanation of underlying mechanisms; value of introducing new more hopeful stories, 
defaultand 
defaultneed for a strong narrative to take visitors/readers through. A museum environment provides an opportunity to 
defaultachieve
default this 
default–
default an
default 
defaultexhibition is a visual medium; we’re able to introduce objects that are used in mul
defaulttiple areas of climate science
default research together with stories of the scientists; interactives provide active engagement with science fundamentals and the opportunity to see cause and effect and play out scenarios.

defaultThe majority of visitors’ perceptions of the gallery are positive. In evaluation surveys, visitors described the gallery as ‘interesting’ (88% of surveyed visitors), ‘enjoyable’ (79%) and ‘educational’ (76%). In addition, our qualitative research provides evidence of learning among those who visit. For instance, interviewees reported greater confidence expressing views about climate change, and being inspired to learn more about the subject – both of these are measures that we attribute to visitors having had a meaningful learning experience (Clipson and Hobson 2011; 
defaultScience Museum 2009).
default10.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo date we have given over 50 tours of the gallery to organizations and high profile individuals from political, business and cultural spheres. The gallery has been visited by international visitors including Al Gore, the Chinese Ambassador, and a delegation of MP’s from India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. All have been interested in how the Museum has successfully communication this complex issue.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur online educational game, 
defaultRIZK
default, allows millions of visitors across the world to explore risk management 
defaultand investigate
default the relationship between probability and frequency. 
default11.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe role art can play in obliquely communicating complex messages is well documented (e.g. Cameron et al. 2013) and the Science Museum’s Arts Programme has played a growing role in the way we engage our visitors with scientific and technological issues. One innovative offer that launched in 2010 is our Cockroach Tour, a participative art piece by Danish collective Superflex. Visitors explore the Museum and the story of human history and society from the perspective of cockroaches. Though offbeat, this project has proved 
defaulthighly
default popular (receiving 84 unsolicited positive feedback responses in its first year) and provides a new way of engaging with the issue.
default Another example is the art commission within the 
defaultatmosphere
default gallery itself – most recently Tony White’s new novel 
defaultShackleton’s Man Goes South
default (launched 2013).

defaultThrough a current project 
defaultClimate Changing Stories
default, we seek to demonstrate that every object in our collection has the capacity to tell a story about climate change. A trail of exhibits runs through the museum, consisting of reinterpreted objects from our collection and provocative art installations. 
defaultSome examples include the Bersey cab, which is an early electric taxi from the 1890s, and artist Thomas Thwaites’s Toaster Project, a comment on the hidden side of mass production.

defaultOur Dana Centre, a pioneer in using dialogue events (adult, face-to-face forums) as a method of engaging the public in science and technology, has received 1219 adult attendees to climate-themed evenings since December 2010.
