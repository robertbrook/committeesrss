defaultSUBMISSION
default&#xa0;
defaultI would like the Select Committee to consider the effect of the Deregulation of Buses Act 1985 on bus transport
default in the UK 
defaultas it exists today.
default  I believe the whole picture 
defaultof bus travel has to be considered before “Passenger Transport in Isolated Communities” can be addressed.
default&#xa0;
defaultTo illustrate my concern, I wish to describe 
defaultmy
default experience with a commercial bus company that has become a symptomatic example of how isolation from 
defaultbus services can occur.
default&#xa0;
defaultTRAVEL IN TRING, HERTFORDSHIRE
default&#xa0;
defaultI am a resident of Tring, a market town in South West Hertfordshire and only 30 miles from London.  There are two major commercial bus routes serving Tring: - Arriva 500 Aylesbury to Watford, and Arr
defaultiva 61 Aylesbury to Luton.
default&#xa0;
defaultTring Railway Station is on the West Coast mainline and has a London Midland commuter service to Euston.  Tring Station is 1½ miles from Tring town centre and therefore 
defaultthere are
default difficulties of access for those without a car.
default&#xa0;
defaultCHANGE OF ROUTE FOR ARRIVA BUS ROUTE 500
default&#xa0;
defaultOn 10
defaultth
default May 2010 Arriva the Shires changed the route of the 500 bus service so that the area of housing to the eastern side of the town was no longer served.  The bus now travels along a road with no housing but passes a Tesco store, and the difference in the len
defaultgth of route is less than half a mile.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe only response from Arriva to the passengers who were affected by the cut was that “Arriva regrets any inconvenience caused”.  In August 2010 I arranged a meeting with two Arriva Managers, the Tring Town Mayor, Da
defaultvid Gauke MP and our County Councillor.  We were told that due to highways problems elsewhere in the County
default,
default the cut in Tring had to be made to protect the punctuality of the 500 bus.
default&#xa0;
defaultAn account of the ensuing efforts to tackle the highways concerns is gi
defaultven in my article “A Tale from Tring” published in “Bus User” No. 47 Summer 2012 by Bus Users UK available on 
defaultwww.bususers.org
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultBy 14
defaultth
default August 2011, County Councillor Stuart Pile, Executive Member Highways &amp; Transpo
defaultrt, Herts County Council, was able to write to David Gauke MP stating that in his opinion the highways problems were settled.  However, after three years we still do not have our bus back.
default&#xa0;
defaultTHE EFFECT OF THE CUT IN ROUTE 500
default&#xa0;
defaultFor over 30 years, since t
defaulthe eastern side of Tring was developed for housing, the 500 bus had connected passengers to the amenities of Tring town, Aylesbury, Berkhamsted, Hemel Hempstead, and Watford.  A school time service is retained for Tring Secondary School.
default&#xa0;
defaultWithout the bus t
defaulthere is at least a half-mile walk to Tring
default town centre with its amenities
default and other bus connections
default (uphill on the return)
default, and 
defaultover a
default 1 mile to the main doctors’ surgery,
defaultDuring the day, bus passengers using the 500 were mainly elderly
default,
default and they are now w
defaultithout the freedom to travel without gaining assistance from friends, or local voluntary agencies, or paying the standard cost of a taxi to town of £5.00.
default&#xa0;
defaultTherefore even in a town that is only 30 miles from London, there are people who have planned their 
defaultlives around a bus service and are left isolated in a suburban area.
default&#xa0;
defaultMY THOUGHTS ON BUS ORGANISATION IN 2013
default&#xa0;
defaultTRI
defaultNG BUS USERS GROUP
default&#xa0;
defaultI launched the Group this year as a member group of Bus Users UK, to encourage bus use in Tring and the Villages.  
defaultThe formation of the Group has 
defaulthelped build
default relationship
defaults
default with our local bus companies, 
defaultwhereby we
default can 
defaultnow gain advance n
defaultotice of
default route changes etc.  
default&#xa0;
defaultOur first speaker in May 2013 was Paul Morgan, Network Development Manager for Arriva the Shires.  He explained that the 500 bus route is currently again under review, and the Group is hoping to be able to comment on this rev
defaultiew before it is finalised.
default&#xa0;
defaultTring Bus Users Group is 
defaultalso 
defaultworking with Herts County Council to try and improve the County funded local within 
defaulttheir 
defaulttight cost restraints.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultCONCLUSION
default&#xa0;
defaultIf buses are not to be re-nationalised, then Government oversight must
default be obtained such as exists for London with “Transport for London” in order to gain some control over the bus industry.  There will be more and more cuts in routes by commercial companies as profits take priority, and County Councils will be relied upon to
default provide public transport for those left without buses and therefore in isolated communities.
