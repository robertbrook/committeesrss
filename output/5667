defaultQ162 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultThe Chairman:default It is very kind of you to give this time to us. Rebecca, you are the Vice-President of the Youth Intergroup?
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: Yes.
defaultThe Chairman:default That is right. Luca Scarpiello
default. 
defaultLord Freeman, can you introduce yourself?
defaultQ163 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Freeman:default Roger Freeman, Conservative Peer, former Member of Parliament. May I ask you very briefly to explain what the Youth Intergroup is?
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: Right, yes. There are a number of intergroups. They are a little bit like APPGs, but the difference is 
defaultthat 
defaultthere are a maximum number of intergroups, whereas obviously with APPGs you can have as many as you like as long as enough people sign up. There is quite a competition for the Intergroup. Is it 12 or 14 members?
defaultLuca Scarpiellodefault: Fourteen.
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: It is 14, yes. There are 14 intergroups in total and anything else is an interest group or a working group. It does not have the official status of 
defaultan 
defaultintergroup. Youth Intergroup is one of the 14 intergroups and, obviously, youth employment is a big issue.
defaultLord Freeman:default Based here?
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: Yes. It is cross
default-
defaultparty. They are always cross
default-
defaultparty. The president of the intergroup is from the Socialists &amp; Democrats Group, and then I am the Vice-President from ALDE, from the Liberals, and then there 
defaultare 
defaultVice-President
defaults 
defaultfrom the Greens, from the EPP, and from GUE
default—
defaultcorrect?
defaultLuca Scarpiellodefault: Yes.
defaultThe Chairman:default Right. We are trying to get the Members of this Committee to introduce themselves. Lord Freeman, how many years in Parliament?
defaultLord Freeman:default Thirty-one.
defaultThe Chairman:default In both Houses. Lord Brooke, can 
defaultyou 
defaultintroduce yourself
default?
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default I am Clive Brooke. I am a Labour Peer. I have been there about 16 years, prior to which I was in the Labour movement as a union general secretary for tax staff.
defaultThe Chairman:default Yes, beloved by all.
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: I have just paid my tax bill this weekend.
defaultThe Chairman:default So did I.
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default I am David Wilson. I am an independent 
defaultC
defaultross
default-B
defaultench Peer, 20 years or so in the House of Lords. Before that, I had quite an involvement in Asia, but 
defaultChina
default and Hong Kong rather than 
defaultJapan
default, which is your subject, is it not?
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: I did study Japanese, yes.
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default At 
defaultLeeds
default?
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: Yes, at 
defaultLeeds
default.
defaultThe Chairman:default I am Detta O’Cathain. I emigrated to the 
defaultUK
default nearly 50 years ago and I have been in the House of Lords for 22 years. I came up the business route. I was not in Parliament. I was not in the House of Commons and I was not a member of a political party, but I am a Conservative and I sit on the Conservative 
defaultB
defaultenches. This Committee is a sub-committee of the overall Select Committee of the European Union. We have the remit of the internal market, infrastructure and employment. The reason we are doing this inquiry and that these four Members, the three of them and me, are representing 12 
defaultm
defaultembers of our sub-committee
default,
default is that we have the responsibility to scrutinise all the documentation that comes within those three areas of business. This particular issue of youth unemployment and the Youth Guarantee and all these issues that the EU has been concentrating on, quite rightly, were ones that we felt that we ought to get involved with. We are doing a report, which will come out in mid-April, and, of course, we will send you a copy.
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: Excellent.
defaultThe Chairman:default After this session, you will receive a transcript of the session to check and correct. This will be put on the public record in printed form and on the parliamentary website. Again, I reiterate: thank you very much indeed.
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: No problem.
defaultQ164 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultThe Chairman:default Now, if you want to make a brief one-minute opening statement, either of you or both, please feel free before we get on to the questions.
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: The questions cover pretty much anything I might want to say
default,
default so I would just go through the questions.
defaultThe Chairman:default Okay. Thank you very much indeed.
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: I will probably give the overview and then Luca will give the detail. The general consensus is that there is a jobs crisis in 
defaultEurope
default full stop
default,
default but that it has been felt far more acutely by young people. Even in those countries where youth unemployment is not such a serious problem, it is still more difficult for under-25s to get a job. There is a lot of concern that if it is not tackled you 
defaultwill 
defaultget this lost generation thing where if people suffer unemployment or precarious employment for a number of years
default, it has 
defaulta knock-on effect 
defaulto
defaultn their long-term career prospects.
defaultThere are a number of things to look at. One is obviously the demand side
default. E
defaultmployers are simply recruiting 
defaultfewer workers, 
defaultand particularly are recruiting 
defaultfewer 
defaultyoung workers, because the less experience you have
default,
default the more difficult it is to get into the employment market. That is where it is important to look at incentives that help businesses hire young people
default,
default and also obviously incentives that help companies in the right sectors. For example, we had the 
defaultG
defaultreen 
defaultJ
defaultobs initiative in the 
defaultUK
default;
default that is a very good example. It is not willy-nilly. It is really for areas that are considered to have growth potential
default,
default because
default,
default obviously
default,
default if those areas grow there will be more jobs and more jobs for young people. There is also the problem of two-tier labour markets where you have a core of people who are highly protected and young people who just do not get a chance to get that kind of employment protection and end up 
defaultwith work that is 
defaulteither temporary or—
defaultThe Chairman:default Seasonal?
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: Yes, seasonal. I would say freelance
default,
default but freelance is something in my mind a little bit different that people choose to do. I know that in 
defaultItaly
default you have this contract
default called 
defaultthe co
default.co.co
default.
defaultLuca Scarpiellodefault: Yes.
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: Maybe you can explain what that is.
defaultThe Chairman:default Right, so 
defaultthis is 
defaultyour statement.
defaultLuca Scarpiellodefault: Yes. Well, in Italy the comparison with the UK system is the zero-hour contract, which basically is also now in discussion not only in Italy but all over Europe, because 
defaultthose types of contract 
defaulthave 
defaulta 
defaulthuge social cost, especially if they are not also match
defaulted by 
defaultreforms 
defaultto 
defaultthe welfare system that 
defaultbalance 
defaultthe on-call 
defaultnature of the 
defaultjob 
defaultwith
default the income stability of the person.
defaultIn general, completing what Rebecca was saying, one of the biggest mistakes that we are doing today in Europe is to consider youth employment as something aside from the general employment crisis that we are having in 
defaultEurope
default. I do not have to remind you of the economic outlook and also 
defaultof 
defaultthe employment outlook. It is clear that instead this is a part of this outlook and, in general, it is also clear that we will not improve the situation of young people in the labour market unless we are triggering consistent industrial policy, especially at European level, that can support enterprises to invest again and also, of course, to invest in the labour market in human resources.
defaultWhen we talk about the special features of young people and their approach to employment, of course, first of all we have to consider that so far they have been—if you see the OECD report on this—the ones that have paid the highest toll in the economic crisis so far. They are also the key potential to trigger a new recovery in 
defaultEurope
default and also to trigger what we call the ecological conversion of our society, especially if you consider that we are talking about the most skilled generation ever.
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: The whole green jobs agenda, yes.
defaultLuca Scarpiellodefault: When it comes to the actions that we could take in the labour market, also completing what Rebecca was saying, it is important to consider three main dimensions that are fundamental.
defaultThe first one is the demand side. Because we have a number of structural barriers to youth employment today in Europe, and also in the UK, of course, starting from the consideration that the crisis has de
defaultgraded
default the productive manufacturing fabric and this 
defaulthas 
defaultdelayed the investment and employment of new human resources, it is, therefore, fundamental to stimulate the industrial and productive system, especially in the more innovative technologies. Investment in the more innovative technologies is today also a way to fight youth unemployment.
defaultThe second is, of course, that in Europe—and this is a shared problem 
defaultwith 
defaultthe 
defaultUK
default—we have a strong duality and segmentation of the labour market. It is a matter of fact that young people today are the most exposed to the problems 
defaultof 
defaultstability 
defaultin 
defaultthe labour market, the first ones to be dismissed, and the last ones to be hired. For this
default,
default a reference for you could be the OECD employment index for regular contracts. We have seen that in the past the legislation when it comes especially to hiring for temporary contracts—we have seen in the UK the zero
default-hours
default contract—did not have an impact on the hiring preparation of the enterprises. This is not an opinion; this is a fact that was put together by the OECD in the last 
defaultE
defaultconomic 
defaultO
defaultutlook
default. Therefore, when it comes to reducing the barriers, the priority should be to reduce the segmentation especially between temporary and stable contracts and try to reduce the gap in a way.
defaultThe Chairman:default Yes, that is the detail. Overall, would 
defaultyou 
defaultagree that it is 
defaultprobably 
defaultthe most difficult problem facing the European Union at the moment?
defaultLuca Scarpiellodefault: Absolutely.
defaultThe Chairman:default Shall we get into the questions now?
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: Yes.
defaultQ165 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you. The general consensus, as I said, is that the current youth unemployment across 
defaultEurope
default is the most serious aspect of the current economic crisis. Could you summarise for us in your own view exactly what the nature of the current problems are and what issues you are most concerned about? I think you have more or less done that, have you not, both of you?
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: Yes. One of the issues is, as I say, the precariousness. You also have unpaid internships in there as well
default,
default where the opportunities are only for certain people. You have an issue there. The 
defaultYouth 
defaultIntergroup has been doing quite a lot of work on that because there is also the issue that people even 
defaultget 
defaulta paid internship and then when they go for a job they say, “Oh, you have never done a real job.”
defaultThe Chairman:default Yes, quite.
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: So they end up in a kind of vicious circle of doing five or six, or maybe not five or six but—
defaultThe Chairman:default They cannot take you because you are inexperienced—
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: 
defaultBut y
defaultou have been working for three years.
defaultThe Chairman:default Yes, exactly.
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: Yes, that is an issue. Luca mentioned briefly the issue of welfare systems. They need to be able to support young people so that if, for example, you have a temporary job and then that ends, there needs to be that support so that you do not completely fall out of the labour market and you do not lose touch with the labour market. Obviously, that has to be conditional
default;
default if there is training or help on offer
default,
default you need actively 
defaultto 
defaultbe looking for a job. I think nobody disagrees with that.
defaultQ166 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultTo what extent do you see the issue as being about the demand side, the availability of jobs, and to what extent the supply side, how well young people are prepared for the labour market with regard to their skills or employability?
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: It is both, really. There was rising youth unemployment previously, certainly in the 
defaultUK
default when there was a boom, and that was among a certain section of the population. Graduates were not included in that, for example, so 
defaultit 
defaultwas a skills issue. The youth unemployment now is not just those with lower skills. It is graduates as well
default. I
defaultn my day—I graduated in 1997—it was almost impossible not to get a job. The only people who did not get a job were people who really did not want one. A friend of mine tried being unemployed for a few months but he gave up because it was easier to find a job. Seriously, he just wanted a rest. He had worked so hard for his exams; he just wanted a rest.
defaultIt is a very different situation now. I have a stepbrother and it has taken him a year to find a job. He has been cleaning a pub. He is a maths graduate and he has been cleaning a pub. He has an appropriate job now, but he was prepared to do anything in order to work. That is something that when I graduated in 1997 would have been almost unheard of. Obviously, it is much more difficult for people who do not have qualifications, but that does not mean that it is necessarily easy because we have the problem of graduate unemployment, which existed already in a number of European countries before the crisis. You ha
defaultve
default problems that did not happen, for example, in the 
defaultUK
default, in 
defaultGermany
default, in the 
defaultNetherlands
default. There are the OECD recommendations, which are aimed less, I would say, at the skilled or highly educated employees 
defaultand more at 
defaultminimising school drop-out, promoting a combination of work and study, which is what we are having in the 
defaultUK
default now with the apprenticeships, and offering people a second chance to get a qualification.
defaultQ167 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default What role should different stakeholders play in tackling youth unemployment—for example, the Commission, national Governments, businesses or trade unions—and how does the work of the Youth Intergroup feed into this dialogue?
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: Yes. Well, obviously, this is something that cannot come 
defaultonly 
defaultfrom Government; it has to involve trade unions, youth organisations
default and
default employers.
defaultThe Chairman:default Educationalists?
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: Education and training providers
default, yes
default. They all have their role to play. What we do in the Youth Intergroup is work very closely with the European Youth Forum, which is the umbrella organisation of youth organisations across 
defaultEurope
default. We work very closely with
default the forum
default. We also, obviously, have contact with businesses and with trade union organisations in 
defaultBrussels
default. We do that anyway because you cannot not have that dialogue
default; it 
defaultis really important. The countries that we know that have done better on youth unemployment than others are ones where they have a strong social dialogue that does involve all the actors. 
defaultFinland
default is 
defaulta 
defaultvery good example.
defaultWe do a lot of joint events with the Youth Forum. When we have panels we always have a representative from the Youth Forum speaking. We usually have a representative from a trade union or from an employers
default’
default organisation. For example, for the one on internships we had someone from Microsoft there. We do that actively in what we do. It is never just the Youth Intergroup. It is always involving different stakeholders.
defaultThe Chairman:default Lord Freeman, this is an issue that you should contend with. Is there anything else you want to ask before you come in?
defaultQ168 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Freeman:default Well, I am interested in your views, looking at 13, 14 and 15 year-olds in our education system—I am now looking at the UK; I do not have experience with other countries—about whether there are policies and interventions that could usefully prepare young people for the world of work, which now is so totally different from 20 or 30 years ago.
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: Yes. It is interesting. The Youth Intergroup has not addressed this yet, but one thing I have raised a couple of times is the issue of careers education and not necessarily employability skills but almost job-hunting skills, if that makes sense. From personal experience, I see that there is a huge difference. For example, when we advertised Luca’s role, we had 280 applicants from almost every country across 
defaultEurope
default. Obviously, there are different styles to do a CV and so on; this is marginal. There was a big difference in the quality of the applications. Probably 200 of them could be immediately dismissed because there was not—
defaultLord Freeman:default Was that literacy, attitude, experience, behaviour?
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: No, it was not literacy, not generally, and it was not qualification
defaults
default. It was that they could have been applying for any job, any job whatever. In fact, they might as well have just written on their application, “I would like a job”
default,
default because that is essentially what it said. They did not look at the role. They did not look at the 
defaultYouth 
defaultIntergroup. They did not look at the kind of things we do.
defaultHaving said that, there were 40 applica
defaultnts
default 
defaultwho 
defaultwere really good, who did look at the job and showed how they had some interest. Obviously, Luca did extremely well because he got the job. I was just really struck. These were, in some cases, people who went to very good universities, world-renowned universities, and I am saying, “What kind of preparation are people getting for job hunting?” Clearly, some of them knew how to do an application and some of them did not have a clue.
defaultThis is something we have not
default addressed
default, unfortunately, and I think it is something that is very local. There are different trends. For example, in 
defaultFrance
default, it is normal to put your photo on a CV. We do not do that in the 
defaultUK
default, it would be slightly strange. In 
defaultGermany
default, you send all the references and your qualifications with an application. In 
defaultBelgium
default, nobody asks you for copies of your degree. There are different customs or traditions, which obviously it is useful to know. This is something we have not looked into
default,
default but I would like to.
defaultIt links back also to the point about 13, 14 and 15 year-olds because I have contact with an organisation that makes packs for schools and works a lot with schools in Yorkshire. They work across the country. They say it is vital to get children before that age. At that age some of them are already switching off because they do not see the link between the education they are doing and what they might want to do in later life. The guy I spoke to from the training company gave an example
default,
default saying 
defaultthat 
defaulthe went to give a talk and a young man said, “Yes, I would like to be a blacksmith”
default.
default He said, “Well, maybe doing chemistry and physics would be quite useful if you want to do that”
default.
default Although he loved horses and he wanted to do that, he had not made the connection with what he was studying
default,
default and 
defaultrealised 
defaultthat it was a step on to what he might want to do. I have not seen any perfect solutions, unfortunately, but I think it is something that certainly does need to be addressed.
defaultLord Freeman:default I have a short follow-up. Would you agree with me—putting on hold my next question—that we should focus on 13, 14 and 15 year-olds, very often 
defaultthe children of 
defaultsingle parents, for example, with perhaps very little experience being brought to the table by the teaching profession
default? This is 
defaultno criticism of the teaching profession
default.
default Do you agree with me that that is a particularly important age group? I am not talking about university graduates
default,
default but motivating young people and getting them to think about what they can and should be able to do?
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: As I say, the people that I spoke to said it should be happening 
defaulteven 
defaultbefore then because by then some of them may have already switched off, which is exactly what you do not want to happen. Yes, I think it is something that is neglected
default,
default and if you leave it for another five years
default,
default they are biding their time for five years if only to get out.
defaultLuca Scarpiellodefault: Just on this a couple of things and then I will come back to the question concerning the social dialogue.
defaultThe problem is also that in 
defaultEurope
default this issue of the 13, 14 and 15 year-olds has been tackled many times. One of the key issues within the Europe 2020 strategy is to reduce the dropout rate. Of course, at the moment we have also seen with the crisis the dropout making very little progress. Therefore, this has to be one of the priority areas. Many countries, for instance, are using an earlier canalisation into 
defaulttechnical 
defaultor regular secondary schools, which is not necessarily the right solution if you do not also create the possibility for young people to pass from one path to the others. Of course, at that age is the earliest you are doing the canalisation. There is very little chance for the students to understand their potential, so you have to create the possibility for one person to pass from one path to the other, maybe to attend university afterwards or a further professional or 
defaultvocational training
default opportunity afterwards.
defaultLet me also say in this regard that we have to change our strategies a bit when it comes to reducing the dropout; for instance, involving the community-based and youth organisations much more. Non-formal education strategies could also be extremely useful to provide young people with the soft skills that are necessary to the labour market today. We have a bit to do to reduce the boundaries between schools and what is outside schools, which has been today in 
defaultEurope
default the problem.
defaultConcerning what the different stakeholders can do, as 
defaultYouth 
defaultIntergroup we had one priority: to make sure that the Youth Guarantee is not something done only by the Government. We have to create ownership of the process by different stakeholders. Of course, there is on one side the social dialogue that is fundamental, and on the other side youth organisations, the community-based organisations and civil society 
defaultthat 
defaultmust have a role. This is also why in the negotiation of the framework of the Social Fund we put the provision that in order to use the funds of the youth employment initiative there has to be also an involvement of the social partners and the youth organisation when it comes to designing and assessing the schemes. It is also something that in the 
defaultUK
default must be implemented, especially for the regions that request the funds; in particular, in 
defaultLondon
default, Merseyside, the south
default-
defaultwest, 
defaultScotland
default, and so on.
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: There are only a certain number of regions that qualify for the European Social Fund.
defaultQ169 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default I was going to deal with the three main elements of the initiative that you run. Before that, could I just raise a question on the issue of dropouts? Is this a competency of the EU or is it, in fact, national?
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: No, it is national. It is part of the European strategy
default,
default but obviously it is something implemented at national level. There is no EU competence in education. 
defaultObviously t
defaulthere are programmes
default 
defaultthat people can benefit from, but
default,
default it is all national.
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default I am not disputing you; I am just raising the question.
defaultLuca Scarpiellodefault: On this I just want to say that we have the open method of co-ordination on this issue, which is not saying that we have to take over the competence from the member state but we need to co-ordinate the strategy on this. ERASMUS+, the new programme for education and training for the next economic cycle, is also putting a number of funds available in this regard.
defaultQ170 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default That leads us then on to the question now about the three strands of the approach. We have talked about the youth employment programme with a link to the Youth Guarantee, which at present we do not, as you are aware, have in the 
defaultUK
default. We have the youth employment initiative wit
defaulth the €6 billion now being allocated to it, and now we have within the European Social Fund a push to have more of the money that would be spent between 2014 and 2020 to go towards youth unemployment. I know it is rather early in certain areas to give a ju
defaultdgment on how the initiative will work, but generally what do you think about it? Do you think it is going to work well or do you think there are other changes that are needed and, if so, what would you suggest should be looked at?
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: I think it is a very good step in the right direction because there needed to be something. Some countries were already doing things. The 
defaultUK
default ha
defaults
default been doing things with apprenticeships and the Youth Guarantee, but there was not anything that was EU-wide
default and
default was expanding to other countries. Now, in order to get these funds, the countries have to implement a Youth Guarantee scheme. That is a really positive development. It is all designed to stop people falling out of the labour market for too long early in their careers, and I think that is vital.
defaultAt the moment, what Luca has kindly done is put together some information on what is being done in different countries. Obviously, we cannot judge it yet. We do not know if it is successful yet because it is only being implemented right now. In some countries there are only some regions that are eligible. In the 
defaultUK
default there are a few. It depends. In 
defaultBelgium
default it seems to be the south. Luca has kindly put this together and we are happy to share this document with you. It is probably quite useful.
defaultThe Chairman:default Very useful indeed.
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: I am not going to go through all of it because there is quite a bit. We 
defaultcann
defaultot yet say whether it is going to work. The criticism that was made at the beginning is that it is not enough mon
defaultey. If I recall correctly, it is €6 billion in total, but that works out to be roughly €600 for each unemployed young person 
defaultwhom 
defaultyou want to help. If I think what the 
defaultUK
default Youth Guarantee is, it is much more than that for employers. I think it is about doub
defaultle that, is it not? It is a lot more than €600. There have been some people saying it is not enough, but it is a lot more than what was originally proposed.
defaultThe Chairman:default Yes, but great oaks from little acorns grow.
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: Exactly, that is the pla
defaultn.
defaultThe Chairman:default It could be seen as seed corn, could it not?
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: Yes, hopefully. The idea, obviously, is that this does not take away other measures that are happening at national level. It is in addition to, not instead of
default—
defaultfor those regions that need it
default—
defaultthe ability to use the European Social Fund for youth employment measures and the strong encouragement that I think is really important. We are right at the beginning of this now, so it is a massive step in the right direction because the ultimate aim of the Youth Guarantee is that no one is out of work or training for more than six months. Is it six months or four months?
defaultLuca Scarpiellodefault: Four.
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: Sorry, it is four months. That is a really key point if it will be implemented correctly.
defaultLuca Scarpiellodefault: I will address a complementary small point that is fundamental. To focus, to concentrate the effect of the funds, there has been a front
default-
defaultloading of the fund from having been spread throughout the seven years into the first two years. 
defaultOf course, this is important because, for instance, for the 
defaultUK
default regions we will have something like €192 million available, but at the same time it is posing a number of questions for the continuity of the programme afterwards. This is something that, of course, also the legislators in the 
defaultUK
default have to take into consideration while planning the measures.
defaultThe second thing is we have to understand that the Youth Guarantee is, let us say, an incentive to change culturally the way our active employment services ar
defaulte conceived, from young people 
defaultwho 
defaulthave to go to the public employment services if they are unemployed to public employment services that go to young people and together think about a personalised path. Therefore, a Youth Guarantee without an effective reform of the public employment services and without everything we said about economic and manufacturing development is ineffective because it is not by itself creating one single job place.
defaultQ171 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default As you know, what we are trying to do in this group and this report is get a clearer picture of what the EU as such does on unemployment
default,
default since it is a massive issue for all the nation states of the European Union. The question is: what is the EU doing? It did seem to me that your 
defaultYouth 
defaultIntergroup should have a very good handle on which member states you think are making good use of what Europe is putting forward
default and
default which are not
default. Y
defaultou might even want to comment on how the 
defaultUK
default 
defaultd
defaultoes on that list.
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: We have not done an in-depth analysis but, yes, if you look across 
defaultEurope
default I do not think it is a coincidence that the countries with the strongest higher vocational training systems are those with the lowest youth unemployment.
defaultThe Chairman:default Like 
defaultGermany
default.
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: Like 
defaultGermany
default, like the 
defaultNetherlands
default, like 
defaultAustria
default. I do not think that is a coincidence. In those countries, there are 
defaultfewer 
defaultpeople 
defaultwho 
defaultgo to university but it does not mean they have a less skilled labour market. Certainly, this is not revolutionary at all, but in the 
defaultUK
default in the 
defaultp
defaultast 15 to 20 years I would not say there was a dismissing of higher vocational education but 
defaultan 
defaultassumption that if you were in any way bright you must go to university
default. There 
defaultwere not any other options. The other options were not good enough. They were inferior. I think this has been a big mistake. I happen to know how it works in 
defaultGermany
default because I have family who are teachers in 
defaultGermany
default. If after school you get an apprenticeship and you work partly in a company and you go to college one or two days a week—to a technische hochschule usually—that is not in any way looked down upon as being inferior to university. It is just different. That is something that we are tackling in the 
defaultUK
default with the increase of apprenticeships, but certainly we can look at the countries that have these much stronger and very integrated systems of higher vocational education
default—
defaultvery integrated with employers.
defaultQ172 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default Could I just follow up a bit? Personally, I have a great deal of sympathy with what you are saying. We made a very sad mistake 
defaultin 
defaultcalling our technical colleges, which are extremely efficient, universities and making them into research bodies rather than practical
default ones
default. Just getting more on to the question of which countries pick up the initiatives from Europe best, you are implying that it is the countries 
defaultthat 
defaultdo that
default,
default but I am not sure quite how that relates to the policies that the Commission has put forward.
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default Or, to put it another way, were they doing 
defaultit 
defaultthemselves before the initiatives came up?
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: This is it, yes. The whole point of the open method of co-ordination is that it gives the opportunity for countries to learn from others. It is not decentralised policy that everybody is following; it is more like a procedure by which there can be exchange of best practice and things like that. That is exactly what the open method of co-ordination is used for
default,
default because it is areas where there is not any competence. It is used also in health.
defaultQ173 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default 
defaultOn
default Lord Brooke’s point
default,
default then, which is the chicken and which is the egg? Is it EU policies and the Commission that 
defaultare 
defaultmaking countries like Germany, Austria and Finland
default—which you  mentioned—
defaultbehave in a particular way
default,
default or were they behaving in that particular way already
default, and are
default therefore
default more
default efficient at dealing with the problem of unemployment?
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: Yes, obviously the German system of higher vocational education was not created in the 
defaultp
defaultast three years.
defaultThe Chairman:default No, quite.
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: It is a long-term thing. That shows us how those countries are better adapted to take advantage of further opportunities like they have now
default,
default and hopefully provides an opportunity for other countries to say, “That is a good way to do it”
default.
default It is sometimes a bit woolly because it is an open method of co-ordination.
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default Are you doing research in these areas?
defaultLuca Scarpiellodefault: Yes. I will give you a technical answer and then I will try to elaborate on this.
defaultIn the new cycle of the MFF especially, there has been a shift of the priorities in the sense that now the structural funds
default,
default and in general also funds like ERASMUS+ and the 
defaultY
defaultouth 
defaultU
defaultnemployment 
defaultI
defaultnitiative
default,
default are there to support member states to do the so-called structural reforms, basically, in the sense that we support you and we will give you money to have enough leverage to put forward certain reforms that are important into the labour market and into the key areas. This is quite a big change because, of course, it channels the projects that
default the regions are doing into political policy processes and reform policies that are considered important. For instance, in the 
defaultUK
default in the 
defaultp
defaultast seven years you received €700 million for young people, which w
defaultas
default used basically to activate NEET and to activate 
defaultstrategies for young people that were not studying or in employment. For instance, there was the 
defaultT
defaultraining for 
defaultS
defaultuccess programme in Scotland, the new enterprise allowance for entrepreneurship, and other projects in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as well that were used.
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default These are devolved Administrations, of course, not in 
defaultEngland
default.
defaultThe Chairman:default Exactly, yes. They have their own responsibility for that area, not the 
defaultUK
default. I take it from the tenor of your comments that you think that this was not the most efficient use of resources?
defaultLuca Scarpiellodefault: I tell you that this is the new strategy behind why, for instance, the youth employment initiative has been created. In general, there is also the fact that, of course, the economic crisis put a lot of pressure on public funds and many regions, especially in the southern countries, now have only the EU funds to make a bit of leverage when it comes to employment reforms of the welfare system and so on. I would say that in some countries this is really the oxygen for the regions to implement certain measures; for instance, the activation policies for young people. Without this money
default,
default in countries like 
defaultItaly
default, 
defaultSpain
default and 
defaultGreece
default, for instance, there is nothing else. We have to be very aware of this. Sometimes the EU is not complementing
default but 
defaultinitiating
default,
default and in some cases 
defaultit 
defaultis the only source that the member state has.
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default Sorry, Chairman, can I just pin that one down? I introduced myself as being an independent 
defaultC
defaultross
default-B
defaultench Peer. I should have said 
defaultthat 
defaultI was an independent Scottish 
defaultC
defaultross
default-B
defaultench Peer. Do you have a note anywhere of what you just said about what is being done in 
defaultScotland
default and 
defaultWales
default?
defaultLuca Scarpiellodefault: Yes, we can send you the information.
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default I would be very interested. It is not one that has come our way, as far as I know, in what we have been doing so far.
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default We have had a submission from an MEP in 
defaultWales
default, which was quite different.
defaultThe Chairman:default Yes, we did.
defaultLuca Scarpiellodefault: Especially if you are from 
defaultScotland
default, the priority has also been on apprenticeships and internships. There are very good programmes on this. Of course, we can send you information
default,
default but 
defaultit is 
defaultalso available on the website.
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default Yes, thank you very much.
defaultQ174 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultThe Chairman:default As you mentioned apprenticeships over and over and over again, I 
defaultmust say that I 
defaultfear that it is a grossly misunderstood word. The apprenticeships in 
defaultGermany
default would be nothing like the apprenticeships given by McDonald’s, of which there are 
default10,000 in
default the 
defaultUK
default. I am just wondering if there is anywhere some written information 
defaultwith 
defaultan analysis of apprenticeship schemes throughout the 
defaultEU,
default because I think we are in danger of recommending something that may not be fit for purpose.
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: I have 
defaultencountered 
defaulta number of apprenticeships across the region. They are not McDonald’s. We are talking a minimum of three years and you end up with an HND/HNC-level qualification. It is true that the level of NVQ that you get from an apprenticeship can vary.
defaultThe Chairman:default Yes. I would like to interject and say I think what McDonald’s is doing is terrific. The 10,000 people doing the apprenticeships stay with McDonald’s and are promoted and go on, so they get additional skills
default—
defaultcustomer relations being one, for example, which is very important and is never mentioned. It is just that I am getting utterly confused now about the different interpretations of that word.
defaultLuca Scarpiellodefault: Maybe you could also take a look at 
defaultthe work of 
defaultEurofound—the European agency for improving working and living conditions—on apprenticeships. Basically, there is a main difference between an internship and an apprenticeship. In some countries, an apprenticeship is a working and training contract that should lead to the stabilisation of the worker after a period of training in-house. The problem is that the internships instead are completely outside this path. Of course, the strategy that many countries are using
default—
defaultnot only Italy but also, for instance, France
default—
defaultis to use much more the apprenticeship contractors, the prevalent ones, maybe through a system of guarantees that could lead to stabilisation. For this reason also on the internships
default,
default we as 
defaultthe Youth 
defaultIntergroup are working now with the European Parliament. Now there is a scheme that the European Commission has drafted on the quality framework for internships. It is also something valuable where you can look at it as creating a quality framework
default,
default because an experience that is not quality is not helping the students and we are 
defaultjust 
defaultcreating social dumping
default,
default because basically we see also 
defaultthe 
defaultphenomena of enterprises that are using interns instead of paid work. We cannot create in 
defaultEurope
default a secondary sub-labour market.
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default Sorry, I was just going to make a note. I think your contributions are very helpful.
defaultThe Chairman:default Yes, absolutely.
defaultQ175 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default 
defaultGoing b
defaultack to the young people, are you aware of the ways in which the perspective, ideas and views of young people themselves are being gathered to help different bodies at EU, national or local government level? Do you think we have the proper infrastructure to marshal and utilise the contribution that younger people can make in these areas, particularly in regard to developing policy? I personally have a bee in my bonnet about our own Department for Work and Pensions. Do they ever bring 
defaulttogether 
defaultunemployed people, the hard to reach people, and talk to them? Are there any countries that might do that? I think often when you can bring people with common problems together you can get new common solutions that you would not normally alight on.
defaultThe Chairman:default New insight.
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default New insight, yes.
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: At European level, as I think I explained before, the Youth Intergroup does. Yes, we certainly do that and we get really useful input. We work always with umbrella organisations. They have members all across 
defaultEurope
default,
default so you really do get that input. I see a lot of youth organisations myself but not specifically on youth unemployment. Certainly, I do not see any reason why they should not be involved. I have not been involved with that at national level, not specifically on this topic, because it does not actually fall in any of my committees. It is just what I do for the 
defaultYouth 
defaultIntergroup. I sit on committees that do not touch these issues.
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default Are there any youth organisations that maybe—
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: Yes. We have worked with the Youth Council and the Youth Parliament. I have had various things, obviously almost exclusively within the 
defaultYorkshire
default region, on a lot of different issues. It is more that they want to know about the European Union
default,
default so it is more general, but some of them have some fantastic projects that they have done themselves. These are very local projects. You have 15 year-olds negotiating with bus companies to have a ride-around-all-day ticket in the summer, just really good stuff. Some of the ones I met are Youth Parliament members and some of them are youth councillors. We work through some of the youth policy people in the councils, but I have not done it specifically looking at youth unemployment measures
default; it has been
default more on the education front.
defaultLuca Scarpiellodefault: Let me mention two processes that can help you. 
defaultThe f
defaultirst one is structured dialogue. As you know, in youth policies we have a structured dialogue with young people in youth organisations. This is something that can be used. It is basically grass
default-
defaultroots consultation from local to national to European level that should feed into a council conclusion or resolution. Each presidency is on a different issue. There has been one on youth employment whose result you can easily check. I can also send it to you if you wish.
defaultIn general, the problem of those consultations is that on one side, okay, you get consulted. The problem is what you do with this as legislators. Of course, we in the European Parliament have the same problem, I would say. As 
defaultthe Youth 
defaultIntergroup, we are trying to give as much space as possible to young people and youth organisations. As Rebecca said, we are key partners with the European Youth Forum. There are also a lot of British organisations like the British Youth Council
default—
defaultBYC
default—
defaultand so on. How to implement and mainstream those processes into our legislative work and your legislative work I think is the biggest challenge that we have. Young people are asking you, not me, to impact their lives and their conditions
default,
default and it is still an ongoing process and ongoing question on how to further give them the sense o
defaultf ownership of what we are building at European level.
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: The Youth Intergroup did one thing that was quite key in the ERASMUS+
default programme.
default There is a part of that where people can get loans of up to €16,000 to do a 
defaultM
defaultaster’s degree. It is kind 
defaultof a student loan system. We have that facility in the 
defaultUK
default but probably maybe less interest because there are career development loans. There are some countries where that kind of loan does not exist, so this is not to replace national systems but to have another option and in some cases introduce. Basically, you are giving the opportunity 
defaultto 
defaultpeople who do not have parents who can support them to take the loan and complete the Master’s degree. Originally, the procedure for repayment was that after one year you had to start paying back come what may. We said, “What if you have not found a job?” The people at the Commission I think have been out of the labour market for some time. They said, “Oh, everyone who has a Master’s degree finds a job”
default.
default We were like, “No, they do not”
default.
defaultThe Chairman:default This is in the Commission?
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: The people who are probably a bit older than me and have not looked for a job for some time genuinely thought that if you had a Master’s degree there would be no issue with finding employment. We were saying, “No, that is not the case”
default.
defaultWe basically pushed some amendments to say that obviously it is up to each member state how they do it, but there should be some kind of link to your income. Therefore, obviously, if you did not have a job or you had a very low income you could defer payment, which is basically a principle of almost all the national student loan schemes anyway. It is the same in 
defaultGermany
default. It is the same in the Scandinavian countries. That was, in a way, a small point
default,
default but it got to the heart of the whole policy because without that you would put people off taking the loan who are exactly the kind of people who need it because they do not have parents who can help them out. We managed to do that and we did that as 
defaultthe Youth 
defaultIntergroup rather than as individuals. We did make that change so it was quite important.
defaultThe Chairman:default Well done.
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: Yes, because otherwise students are either not going to take it out
default—
defaultthey are not going to take advantage of the scheme
default—
defaultor we are going to get horror stories in the press of people 
defaultwho 
defaultare unemployed and are being forced to pay back this loan for a Master’s degree, which we just thought was horrible. As I say, it was a relatively small thing but the impact hopefully is larger, though obviously that is only one small bit of the ERASMUS programme for those who want to do Master’s degrees. Most people will not do that. That is something that was quite obvious to us. One of our vice-presidents, who is now in the Bundestag, had had a loan like that in Germany 
defaultand 
defaultknew exactly how it worked. She said, “I could have deferred my loan if I had not had a job”
default,
default which makes sense. That was an example of where you can make a difference.
defaultQ176 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultThe Chairman:default Can I just ask how well prepared you think youth are nowadays for a job?
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: It varies tremendously.
defaultThe Chairman:default Is it different by country? Is there a job-shy country or a job-wanting country?
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: No.
defaultLuca Scarpiellodefault: May I give you an answer also? For instance, on internship
defaults
default, the Youth Forum did a very interesting survey on the quality of internships in 
defaultEurope
default, asking young people to 
defaultsay 
defaultwhy they were doing that internship and how many internships they have done before. One of the things that at th
defaulte
default time, one year ago, was extremely interesting was to see that young people have studied, but the problem is that we saw that the requests of the companies have changed tremendously. I will 
defaultgive 
defaultyou an example. Before, the enterprises were seeing in you a potential that would have been developed throughout your working life, and there were a number of training aspects that were done in-house by the company that ha
defaultd
default an interest in investing in your potential. The problem now is the crisis, but this could also be seen before the crisis. The enterprises are externalising the burden of the preparation of young people. Basically, what they are asking is that you have to be ready, trained, when you arrive. This responsibility is a cultural change that somehow we need to prevent. This is also why there is the priority on the apprenticeships because at some point all the burden of the qualification cannot stay on young people 
defaultwho 
defaultare already doing a lot, but you cannot ask one person to be trapped in six or seven internships in a row. Part of the responsibility is also in the entrepreneur culture and how the productive system also perceives the training.
defaultQ177 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultThe Chairman:default In fact, would 
defaultyou 
defaultsay that, like apprenticeships, the definition of internship is completely different even within a country
default, let alone
default from country to country?
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: Even between companies or different employers, yes.
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default It is a worrying development.
defaultThe Chairman:default It is very worrying.
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: There is actually a Facebook blacklist in 
defaultBrussels
default. I do not know who runs it because they keep themselves anonymous for obvious reasons. They have put on there details of organisations that basically exploit interns and do not give them proper training or pay them and so on. Obviously, that is done unofficially.
defaultIt is something that I 
defaultsaw 
defaultbeing tackled where I worked previously, because I used to work in a think tank in 
defaultWestminster
default. We used to originally pay both travel expenses and lunch, but then we went, “No, that is not acceptable”
default.
default Now they get 
defaultthe 
defaultLondon
default living wage.
defaultOur internships were always publicly advertised
default,
default because 
defaultthat 
defaultis another issue: how widely advertised roles are. When I recruit I have always done it completely openly. They are on the website. They are on various job sites where you would expect people to look. In many cases, I have hired people I had never met before, never had any contact with whatever. When we recruited in the Youth Intergroup, we also tried to make it as wide as possible, which is why we got 280 applications for one role.
defaultThe Chairman:default For one job.
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: Yes. We nearly cried when we saw the number of CVs we had to read through.
defaultLuca Scarpiellodefault: We are doing a campaign to eradicate from the European Parliament the unpaid internships in the members’ offices.
defaultThe Chairman:default Yes, but what do the interns think about that? Maybe they think that this is a huge investment in their future and now you are going to jeopardise their future.
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: Well, you are only jeopardising the future of those who have parents wealthy enough to support them.
defaultThe Chairman:default Oh, I see.
defaultLuca Scarpiellodefault: No, let m
defaulte answer this. Each member of the European Parliament has €21,000 for office costs and staff costs per month. There is no single reason why you should not pay your interns. It is again a cultural problem. Of course, it is a burden. It is given always to yo
defaultung people. I can tell you 
defaultthat 
defaultin 
defaultItaly
default, for instance, I was at that time in one committee of the Government regulating the internships. We asked the Government to stop any unpaid internships in the public agencies. We had a co-partnership between the Conference of Italian Universit
defaulty Rectors
default and 
defaultf
defaultoreign ministers that gave the possibility for 1,000 young people to go outside to work in the embassies for free. What CRUI—the Conference of 
defaultItalian University 
defaultRectors—and the foreign ministers did 
defaultwa
defaults instead of saying, “Okay, we will put 3 million—only 3 million in 
defaultItaly
default—to finance the programme”
default,
default they closed the programme. Of course, the young people thought that we were the bad people because the Government was closing it, but then I must ask as a legislator
default:
default who was 
defaultacting 
defaultresponsibl
defaulty?
default Which principle was the winning one? Politics is also about principles.
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: I just think it is not acceptable to have an unpaid internship because you do not make the opportunity available to everybody. Someone should be getting an opportunity to progress their career based on their ability, not based on their ability to have parents 
defaultwho 
defaultcan fund their living expenses.
defaultWe did an event in the Parliament and there was someone speaking who had been on the Microsoft internship programme, which is apparently a very good one. I believe they 
defaulthad previously 
defaultsigned the quality internships
default charter. There was someone making the point exactly as you were, saying, “Yes, my internship is unpaid but I am getting really good experience and it is going to look great on my CV”
default.
default I said, “Who is paying your rent and who is feeding you?” Of course the
default answer was his parents. I said, “If you were borrowing €1,000 a month for your living expenses, or you had to say no to that internship because you had no way of putting a roof over your head and feeding yourself, I think you would feel very different”
default.
default I
default thought I was being a bit mean to him, but the point is 
defaultthat 
defaultit is very easy to say that when you have someone else providing for you. I just do not think that opportunity should be available based on how wealthy your parents are. It is something I feel quite strongly about
default, as you 
defaultmight 
defaulthave 
defaultguess
defaulted
default.
defaultThe Chairman:default I gathered that, yes. I always admire people who have passion, even if it is misdirected. I am not saying yours is at all. Thank you both very much indeed.
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: No problem.
defaultThe Chairman:default It has been very useful. Before you go, if you think there are some areas we really should have questioned you on or if you think that there is something that we could—
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: Yes, when we send you, for example, this document, which is the overview of different—
defaultThe Chairman:default Yes, could you do an aide-m
defaulté
defaultmoir
defaulte
default, if you like, on what we should be thinking of?
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: Yes, sure.
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you very much indeed. It has been a great pleasure.
defaultLuca Scarpiellodefault: Can we take a picture for our website?
defaultRebecca Taylordefault: Yes, we have to.
defaultLuca Scarpiellodefault: Unfortunately, it is not me deciding the communication. It is important for politicians.
defaultThe Chairman:default That is the second time we have been asked for our photographs today. Do not forget we have been up for about 14 or 15 hours.
default&#xa0;
default
