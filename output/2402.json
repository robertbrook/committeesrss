"              \n              \nWritten evidence submitted by\n \nAlzheimer’s disease\n International\n and the Alzheimer’s Society\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe burden of dementia is rapidly becoming a challenge to our global economic, health, and social landscape for b\noth men and women.  Dr \nMargaret Chan, the Director-General of the World Health Organization \nhas recently \nmade a monumental move to declare dementia as a global health priority\n.  In a 2012 WHO report. Dr Chan stated:\n “The need for long-term care for people with dementia strains health and social systems, and budgets. The catastrophic cost of care drives millions of households below the poverty line. The overwhelming number of people whose lives are altered by dementia, combined with the staggering economic burden on families and nations, makes dementia a public health priority”\n.\n \n Another champion of dementia, David Cameron, Prime Minister of the U\nnited Kingdom, in a\n speech in March 2012\n declared:\n “There is that essential spirit of defiance\n,\n that we in this room share\n,\n that together we’re not going to shrug our shoulders or be defeated by this but instead we’re going to work relentlessly to improve lives, to help hundreds of thousands of families to take the fi\nght to dementia”\n.\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is still a tremendous lack of awareness in many lower and middle income countries, especially in Africa.  In the last few years a number of Alzheimer associations have started to work in African countries including Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, Mauritius and Namibia.  They all report a lack of understanding of dementia that is related to mystification and even witchcraft.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn 2010 there were an estimated 35.6 million people with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias worldwide.\n  This number will increase to 66 million by the year 2015 and 115 million by 2050.  The main increase will be in low and middle income countries where more than 70% of people with dementia will live by 2050 (Figure 1).\nFigure 1\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhile there continues to be no way of preventing or curing dementia (the only current medication available only slows the progress in some people with Alzheimer’s Disease) these numbers will be driven up by the ageing world population.  An example of this is in India where it was estimated that in 2010 there were 3.7 million people with dementia\n rising to over 14 million by 2050, with approximately one half of that number being over 75 years, and almost 2 million over 90 years of age.  \n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe overall global and economic impact of dementia starts with the ag\neing population\n. Worldwide the elderly population is rapidly increasing and by 2050, adults over the age of 60 are expected to reach two billion as displayed in the figure below (World Health Organization, 2012). \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFFigure 2\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBy 2030, the oldest segment of the population will increase by 200% in low- and middle-income countries and 68% in developed countries\n which is problematic because it is widely accepted that the main risk factor for dementia is age. In fact, the prevalence of dementia is projected to double every five years after the age of 65 \n. Almost three-quarters of dementia cases will reside in low and middle income countries with most of Asia and Africa experiencing the fastest growth rate shown in the Table 1\n at Annex 1\n.  Yet, the prevalence estimates in developing countries is underestimated due to the lack of research in these areas. To fuel the fire even more, dementia ranks as the second most burdensome chronic disease and accounts for 11.9% of years lived with disability among all chronic non-communicable diseases\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn most developing countries the problem of dementia is, for a variety of reasons, hidden.  The one report which identifies the scale and nature of the problem is \nDementia India Report 2010\n.  This report is a result of a ‘twinning’ programme implemented by ADI, which twinned Alzheimer’s and Related Disorders Society of India (ARDSI) with Alzheimer’s Society based in London.  Alzheimer’s Society was able to assist ARDSI with the establishment of a nation\nal\n office in New Delhi.  It also sourced funding within the UK for the \nDementia India\n report and secured scientific and editorial support from the Institute of Psychiatry\n at King’s College\n in London.  \nDementia India \nnot only gave details of numbers in India, it also analysed the impact of the condition in India and the services required for people living with the condition.  There is no comparable report for any other deve\nloping country\n.  The report would not have been possible without the funding and support provided from within the UK voluntary and academic sectors.  That is indicative of the response to dementia in the developing world.\n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEconomically, dementia costs in 2010 total\nl\ned $604 billion worldwide. To put it into perspective, if dementia was a country, it would be the 18\nth\n largest economy of the world, ranking in 2010 between Turkey and Indonesia. Overall, informal care (unpaid care) and direct costs of social care such as community care and residential homes each made up 42% of total costs followed by direct costs of medical care with 16% \n. However in developing countries, there has been little work\n \non evaluating direct and indirect costs because dementia is viewed as a low priority, there are poorly established health services which are therefore hard to quantify, and fewer health economists have \nexplored these regions\n. Most likely due to the lack of institutionalized care and healthcare resources, informal care makes up 58% of costs in low-income countries versus 40% in high-income countries. \n4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe main burden of dementia is taken by women, because they are getting older and the majority of the cases of dementia worldwide are in women.  But they are also the main informal carers, both in the developed and developing world \n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the absence of almost any policy or action for people with dementia in the developing world the difficulty in identifying what can be done is: just where do we start?  In \nDementia India 2010, \nthe most comprehensive report we have on the issue in a developing country, there are eight recommendations, none of them a great surprise. They refer to making dementia a national priority, increasing funding for research, increasing awareness developing care and providing carer support packages.\n5.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThree priorities for the developed world to assist are clear.  The funding of research into prevention treatment and care is one.  Such research may well be undertaken in the developed world but it is also important to grow research capacity in the low and middle-income countries - particularly when evaluating care models.  A second is raising awareness - which amongst other things will help to reduce the levels of stigma experienced by people with dementia.  The third is creating comprehensive care models suitable for the developing world, supported by research which identifies how this needs to differ from care models in the developed world.\n5.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis would assist the work already being undertaken by the developing world where strategies to combat dementia are being devised eg in Mexico and Peru; and in Pakistan where training programmes for GPs and social workers are being put together.  Capacity building and awareness are the two main challenges.\n5.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor capacity building ADI has developed two successful programmes.  One is ‘Alzheimer’s University’ for emerging associations which takes place each year in London.  Alzheimer’s Society has always been involved in this and is supported by other developed associations in Europe and North America.  With the funding currently available we are able to train people from only 5 – 6 associations each year (all travel and accommodation costs for participants are paid by ADI).\n5.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nADI has members in some of DFID’s 28 priority countries, namely: Pakistan, India, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Nepal.  It is working to develop associations in Uganda, Yemen, Kenya and Ghana.\n5.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn addition to the ‘Alzheimer’s University’ programme, it is also important to enable the developing associations to meet together and Alzheimer’s Society recently \ndonated the profit it had made from an international conference held in London in 2012 to start a fund to encourage these activities.\n5.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe second programme is ‘twinning’, in which a developed association works with a developing association.  Alzheimer’s Society in London twinned with the Indian association resulting in an office in New Delhi being opened, to co-ordinate activities, raise awareness and promote the organisation with the Federal Government.  Funding for the \nDementia India \nreport was also found in the UK but more importantly that project was directed by the 10/66 group at Kings College, London (see 6.3).  Without the twinning programme and the work of Alzheimer’s Society that report would never have been written and published. Other twinning programmes were set up between, for example, Australia and Pakistan, Netherlands and Indonesia and between Canada and Trinidad &amp; Tobego.\n5.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nResearch within the developing world is essential to assist awareness and capacity building.  This can be founded upon work already done, eg care related (where much work has been done in the UK, facilitated by Alzheimer’s Society) and how care may vary between cultures (where the 10/66 Group has done some work).  Prevention research is also important and recent evidence suggesting that risk factors can be modified, and that these factors vary from country to country (largely lifestyle related) again suggests that this is undertaken within the low and middle-income countries.\n5.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo promote the work that needs to be done ADI is now seeking to start a global awareness programme.  This is an ambitious target but it has been greatly assisted by actions in the UK.  The raised level of dementia awareness in this county, prompted by Alzheimer’s Society, has led the British government to implement a comprehensive dementia strategy and in 2012 the Prime Minister issued a challenge to all government departments to seek ways to support the needs of people living with dementia.  With the UK now in the chair of G8, Mr Cameron is bringing together a conference in London this year on 10\nth\n and 11\nth\n December to discuss the issue and there will be a further three conferences arranged next year.  We regard this as hugely important and indicative of the important role played by Britain in the dementia challenge.\n5.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBut DFID’s annual report indicates that it has yet to respond to the Prime Minister’s challenge and in view of the global perspective of this issue we find this surprising \nand disappointing.  Even small interventions by DFID could be significant is raising awareness, building capacity and facilitating research.\n5.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSuch support would almost certainly have to be undertaken in conjunction with, or advised by, specialist agencies – a number of which are based in London, namely: the 10/66 Group (based at Kings College, London); Alzheimer’s Disease International, possibly the single biggest source of information on dementia in the developing world through its 80 member countries; and Alzheimer’s Society which has experience in developing awareness;  researching dementia cause, cure, care and prevention; and providing support services in the UK.  It has also worked with and supported ADI – particularly in India.\n5.12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nADI understands that the International Development Select Committee will be undertaking an investigation later this year into disabilities.  It intends to submit evidence to that investigation based upon and developing this submission.\n5.13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the meantime we are meeting with a minister at the Department for International Development first of all to raise awareness of dementia as a development priority but also to consider the way in which DFID can respond to the Prime Minister’s Challenge on dementia by working with the agencies in London that have the expertise to assist this response.\n              \n&#xa0;\n6.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlzheimer’s Disease International (ADI) was created in 1984 by the Alzheimer societies of the UK, Canada, USA and Australia to be the global voice on dementia and exchange information betwee\nn societies worldwide.  Like\n these organisations it has put Alzheimer’s disease in the name, altho\nugh it covers all dementias, \n to \nhelp \nmake \nit \nclear this is a \ndisease\n of the brain and not just a part of normal ageing. The organisation grew over the years with members from Europe during the 1980s, Asia Pacific and Latin America in the 1990s and from the r\nest of the world since 2000.  It now \nhas now 80 member organisations from all parts of the world. Al\nl\n members are the leading patient and family organisations in their countries. There is currently a number of associations from Africa and the Middle East seeking support and once they are established they w\nill become members\n in the next few years.\n6.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince 1996 ADI has its headquarters in London, like many other global health organisations. Its main achievements are capacity building programmes like the \nAlzheimer University (a training course for staff and volunteers of associations) and the ADI Twinning Programme (that links developed and emerging associations to benefit from exper\nience and expertise).\n6.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe 10/\n66 Dementia Research Group,\n was formed in 1998 in India and is led by a research group fro\nm the Institute of Psychiatry, K\ning’s College London. This group has done ground-breaking community based research in lower and middle-income countries such as China, India, Russia, South Africa, Nigeria and a number of countries in Latin America into the prevalence and incidence of dementia, risk factors and social systems and published over 60 scientific papers into the main international scientific journals. This included a series of five World Alzheimer Reports published with ADI since the year 2009 and the data from these reports are now the leading sources of information on dementia worldwide.\n6.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlzheimer’s Society is the leading dementia charity in the UK, operating in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.  It has long established dementia support services throughout all three of those nations and leads a multi-million pound dementia research funding programme primarily, but not exclusively, within the UK.  It has been credited with raising awareness of dementia to the extent that in 2007 the government made dementia a health priority and became the leading partner in the National Dementia Strategy.  It is working closely with the Prime Minister’s Challenge on dementia and is in the forefront of the work to create dementia friendly communities.  In 2012 it hosted the best attended ADI conference for many years.\n&#xa0;\nAnnex 1\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n              \nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n World Health Organization, 2012\n World Alzheimer Report, 2009\n Dementia India Report 2010, published by Alzheimer’s and Related Disorders Society of India.\n Alzheimer’s Disease International\n Bamford, 2011\n Alzheimer’s Disease International, 2010\n Alzheimer’s Disease International 2009\n Alzheimer’s Disease International, 2010\n Alzheimer’s Disease International, 2009\n Bamford, 2011\n"
