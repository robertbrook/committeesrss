These factors tend to work in opposite directions. The United Nations, for example, confers the ultimate legitimacy on any \nmultilateral action. But the very process of securing that legitimacy can undermine its effectiveness – as we saw, for example, in the Balkans. … \n[L]\negitimacy\n means more than going through the right channels.\nLessons of Libya before Syria.\n&#xa0;\nThe Syria crisis\n1\n0 September 2013\n   \n  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Jason Ralph, ‘No longer special?
