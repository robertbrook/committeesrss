\nMrs Glindon: Good afternoon, Minister.  Do you support the Rural Fair Share campaign for the rural penalty to be reduced from 50% to 40% by 2020?\nBrandon Lewis: We do not agree with their figures, in the sense of the way they calculate the 50% and 40%.  \nTo compare\n like-for-like authorities, if you look at unitary authorities, in 2014-2015, the difference is about 10%; if you look at the shire district areas, in 2014-2015 it will be 12%; if you look at fire and rescue authorities, it will be about minus 3%; and for county councils, it will be about 4%.  That is because the way they assess what is a rural area is quite different \nfrom \nthe way we do.  In a simplistic sense—I can give you a colloquial example of this—the way they look at the rural definition, they would include \nNorfolk\n as a rural county.  I can see the logic of that, but those of us who live in Great Yarmouth, \nNorwich\n and \nKing’s Lynn\n would be \nthe \nfirst to admit we \nare predominantly urban and we have deprived areas and areas of high density as well.  When we distribute funding at DCLG, we do it in different ways.  We would class \nNorfolk\n as North Norfolk, Mid\n&#x2011;\nNorfolk\n, \nBroadland\n, \nBreckland\n and South West Norfolk, not \nNorwich\n or Great Yarmouth or \nKing’s Lynn\n, so it is quite a different way of calculating it.  I have\n had this conversation with SPARSE themselves. \n&#xa0;\nQ2 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nMrs Glindon: With regard to what you said on that, is there a reason why you did not take notice of the \ncall for the \nEfficiency Support for \nS\nervices in \nS\nparse \nA\nreas funding to be \nincreased to £30 \nmillion when Graham Stuart MP asked for that?\nBrandon Lewis: We put\n £8.5 \nmillion in last year.  This year, in the settlement as it currently stands, that is at\n £9.5 \nmillion and we are going \nto roll it into the base,\n because we do recognise—we have been quite clear about this—that there is a gap between rural and urban.  But, as I say, as far as we are concerned, it is not 50% narrowing to 40% in the first place, so to have a discussion \naround £30 \nmillion would be presuming a set of figures that we do not agree with in the first place.  As I say, if you look at it like for like, for 2014-2015 the gap \nranges from a maximum of 12% down to minus 3% for the fire authorities.\n&#xa0;\nQ3 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nMrs Glindon: Do you think that the \nESSSA\n \nis just a temporary fix—a political fix—or do you think it is evidence that the Government and your Department accept there is a rural penalty that needs to be reduced?\nBrandon Lewis: As I said just now, we do agree that there is a gap.  We \nwere sympathetic to the argument\n, and that is why we put the extra money in last year.  We have increased that money to\n £9.5 \nmillion this year and we have put it in the baseline so that it is not just a one-off; it is rolled into the baseline.  We are dealing with that.  In that sense we have recognised the issue and dealt with it.  Having said that, I also need to be quite clear \nthat \nthere is limited evidence of there being considerable extra cost—which some people would argue—of dealing with rural services.  The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has commissioned some work, which we are working with them on, to have a look at this very issue, as it happens.  That will be reporting back later this year and, depending on the findings—and I am not going to pre-judge \nthat; the work is only being commissioned in February or March\n—that may well give everybody something to look at for the next settlement.  But at the moment, as I say, the gap for local authorities ranges from 12% to 4%.  It is not a very big gap \nnow.  \n&#xa0;\nQ4 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nMrs Glindon: There is a big difference between the amount that the Rural Fair Share petition\n are asking for—£30 \nmillion—and that which the Government is saying it will give, so there must be\n some cause for concern that is justified.\nBrandon Lewis: No.  As I said, the difference between the figures is the difference between the 12% and the 40% or 50% that you mentioned in the opening question.  That is because of the way that they are assessing what is a rural area.  As I say, they would class the whole of Norfolk, when in fact there are towns and districts and authorities in Norfolk that are predominantly urban, if not entirely urban, such as, as I said, Norwich, King’s Lynn and Great Yarmouth.  In terms of how we fund, they are not classed as predominantly rural areas.\n&#xa0;\nQ5 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nMrs Glindon: \nIs the \npurpose of revenue support to ensure that everybody would receive the same level of \nlocal \nservice if they were paying a notional uniform council tax across the board?\nBrandon Lewis: The idea of every single person in the country paying the same council tax would be an interesting thing to take forward, and some councils might have different views on that to others.  The money \nthat is distributed through grant predominantly—and obviously the most deprived areas get the highest amount of grant—is in order to make sure they can provide \nthe core services.  Depending on where you are, different councils will make decisions on what their primary focus is and what their priorities are.  I have said to this Committee before everybody expects to have their waste collected—the Secretary of State would argue vehemently that it should be on a weekly basis—and to have the streets kept clean, but the priorities for an individual authority are a matter for the local authority.  That is localism.\n&#xa0;\nQ6 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nMrs Glindon: So there would be different problems in urban and, perhaps, rural areas.\nBrandon Lewis: I am sure some local authorities would argue that there are not only different issues to deal with in a rural area compared to an urban area, which is undoubtedly true.  In an urban area you are dealing with density of population but in close proximity to each other, generally, because of how it is built up; a more rural area will be dealing with higher transport costs or gaps and differences between areas and villages.  Equally, you will find rural areas will make the point, depending on where they are and their proximity to the next town, that they are dealing with different issues according to their area—and the same with urban areas.  I have two of the most deprived wards in the country in my constituency.  Great \nYarmouth\n would make the point that they have very different issues to deal with \nfrom \n some of the areas in the \nMidlands\n and the North, partly because they are a seaside town, partly because some of it is rural\n.\n \n \nParts of \nNorfolk\n \nwould argue there are\n \nareas of \nrural deprivation.  It is quite difficult to say that rural is just different \nfrom\n urban and all rural is the same.  One of the beauties of our country is wherever you go there is something unique and something different, and that gives a different challenge to that authority.  It is also why that power for local authorities to make their own priorities is so important\n,\n because they know what they need to deliver most for their local residents.  \n&#xa0;\nQ7 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nChair: Could I just turn Mary’s \nimportant \nquestion around a little bit?   Is the principle of the grant settlement that it equalises out differences in needs and differences in resources between authorities, to the extent that if everyone were to pay the same level of council tax, they would get the same level of service?\nBrandon Lewis: Do not forget the whole structure of how we finance local government is changing.  The basic baseline—for want of a better phrase—has the banding in; it has the four bands\n,\n which does recognise that.  That is why some authorities will be more grant-dependent than others, so they get that basic funding to be able to \nprovide basic services.  But we have moved to a whole new way of funding local government through the business\n \nrates retention scheme and the New Homes Bonus.  We are moving away from a system that is grant-dependent to a system where local authorities are incentivised to do things.  \n&#xa0;\nQ8 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nChair: So that principle has been eroded, effectively.\nBrandon Lewis: Yes, there is a big shift away from the begging-bowl structure of the past to an incentive-based structure for the future.\n&#xa0;\nQ9 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nMark Pawsey: Minister, can I follow up the concerns of rural communities that Mary has just spoken to you about and particularly ask you about the \nsparsity\n ratings, or the \nsparsity\n allowance?  T\nhe sum of £200 \nmillion was put on one side to reflect that, but then damping provisions were introduced, which meant that three\n-\nquarters of it would not get out to the local authorities.  Was it the Department’s intention to effectively give with one hand and then take away with the other?\nBrandon Lewis: First of all, \nnot every authority—to the point you made, Mr \nPawsey\n—was detrimentally affected.  Technically, you will find some examples of rural authorities \nthat \nge\nt the benefit of the extra £9.5 \nmillion and benefit from damping.  It depends on where you sit on the\n scale.  The decision that was made in late 2012 for the settlement for 2013-2014 put damping in and widened and stretched the bands to make sure there was more protection in there for the most grant-dependent authorities, because there was recognition that although there is a gap between rural and urban—and I have to say\n \nthis is underlining the fundamental difference between the 50% argument and \nour \n12%\n \nat-\nworst-this-\nyear argument—the most grant-dependent authorities, which tend to be in some of the most deprived areas, needed that extra protection to make sure they had the basic funding\n.  It also avoided\n volatility for the business-rates scheme.  \n&#xa0;\nQ10 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nMark Pawsey: I accept that.  You \nhave said that we will look at the situation today and there will be no assessment until 2020.  Is that\n still the case?  You spoke just earlier about looking at a report later this year.  Will that change things, or is that a separate issue?\nBrandon Lewis: There are two different things going on.  The business\n \nrates retention scheme is locked in until 2020, and if we unlock that, then we start \ndisincentivising\n the growth opportunities through th\nat\n scheme.  However, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs are doing some work \non \nthe issues for rural areas.  Our Department is working with them on that.  That work will be done over the summer; it is due to report back in the autumn.  I am not for a moment saying that there will be things in that that we need to look \nat, because we do not know what is in the report yet; it would be pre-judging it.  The SPARSE argument is that there are big differences in the ability or the cost of providing services in rural areas as opposed to urban.  If that report backs that up, it will be the first time realistically there has been solid evidence to back that case up, and then the Government will have to have a look at that.  However, at the moment, that evidence does not exist, and we do not know quite what that report will feed back.  \nT\nhe \nmovements\n \nwe \nare\n able to look at\n—for \nex\nample, this year, with the £9.5 \nmillion\n—give \nus some flexibility, but, again, I would underwrite \nthat \nand say\n,\n if you look at like-for-like authorities, the worst gap is only 12%.  \n&#xa0;\nQ11 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nMark Pawsey: But you are saying to those authorities who feel that they have not done particularly well this year that it does not necessarily mean that there can be no changes between now and 2020, because this report may provide the evidence they need, in which case the Government will act.\nBrandon Lewis: From their point of view, if that report provides evidence, then it is a very strong piece of argument for them to put to the Government.  There is a track record of \nour\n looking year to year at what we need to do to make sure we get the settlement in the right place.  For exam\nple, last year, we put the £8.5 \nmillion in; this \nyear, we put £9.5 \nmillion in.  Last year, we had the de \nminimis\n for some authorities—the lowest quartile of charges.  There have been variations and flexibilities quite regularly within settlements.  I am not pre-judging what may or may not happen next year, but certainly in the past there is evidence that, where there needs to be flexibility, the Government will look at it.  \n&#xa0;\nQ12 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nMark Pawsey: So there will be a regular review.  One of the great concerns is that there is a bi\nt of a cliff face coming. \n \nI\nf there is a perceived unfairness now, the Government are not going to do anything about it until 2020\n; i\nf there is a review in 2020, there could be then significant change.  How will local authorities prepare for that?  Or will Government simply \ndefer yet again?  How can you\n reassure authorities that that is not going to happen?\nBrandon Lewis: I might be going a bit beyond my remit to pre-judge what a Government in 2020 might do, because technically I could be binding the Government after next, just about, depending when in 2020 we are talking about.\nMark Pawsey: But you understand \nthe concerns.  \nBrandon Lewis: I do understand the point, but to make the business\n \nrates retention scheme properly able to incentivise, there needed to be \na baseline, and then beyond that, that growth allows the councils to benefit.  The view was that to lock that in until 2020 was the logical thing, bearing in mind the baseline does recognise the banded floors in the first place.  \n&#xa0;\nQ13 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nChris Williamson: You have probably heard that the Rural Services Network has complained that authorities in the Home Counties have seen the smallest reductions in settlement funding during 2013-2014 through to 2015-2016.  People are asking why these affluent areas are being given an easier ride than more deprived rural and urban local authorities.\nBrandon Lewis: I would argue they are not, in the sense that the most deprived 10% of authorities have a spending power that averages just over £3,000, whereas the \nleast deprived \n10% have a spending power of £1,952.  They have a much higher starting point in the first place.\n&#xa0;\nQ14 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nChris Williamson: The indicative figures for 2015-2016 suggest that there is going to be a 0.6% increase for South East England but a 2% reduction for \nEngland\n as a whole.  I just wondered how you thought th\nat can be fair.\nBrandon Lewis: There were about 40 authorities that had an increase last year; there are some this year; and there will no doubt be some next year.  That potentially could grow.  Those authorities who had those increases had them because\n \nof the New Homes Bonus.  It is proving the incentive is working; they are building the house\ns and they are getting the money.  As the business\n \nrates retention scheme works and as we start to see economic growth, there is a real potential some authorities will see growth through that as well.\n&#xa0;\nQ15 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nChris Williamson: Can you understand, though, why some people think that the Government \nis \nin some ways rigging the situation in favour of more affluent parts of the country, whichever measure you look at, whether it be spending power or grant settlement?  \nF\nor example—and this is often an example that is cited—the Prime Minister’s own local authority area, West Oxfordshire, has seen a per capita increase of £57.23, whereas my own local authority, for example, has seen a reduction of £354.13.  One area that is affluent has seen an increase; an area that is less affluent has seen a massive reduction\n.  \nDerby\n is by no means the worst-affected in that sense\n; m\nany other local authority areas argue that they have seen even bigger reductions.  People just see that as being fundamentally unfair.  I just wondered how you square that circle.  How can you justify that as being reasonable?\nBrandon Lewis: Just to help my memory, because I have not got it in front of me, could you remind me what the spending power for your council is against \nWest Oxfordshire\n?\nChris Williamson: I cannot off the top of my head.\nBrandon Lewis: I think you will find that it is considerably higher than \nWest Oxfordshire\n in the first place.  \nAs I have said, \nWest Oxfordshire\n and the authorities that have had increases, as I have said, have had them because they have the New Homes Bonus.  The incentive scheme is working.  That is something we should be pleased about.  It works, and other authorities can benefit from that.  But you have just highlighted the issue.  For example, as I have said, the most deprived areas tend to have a spending power that is well over £1,000 more than the areas that are more affluent.  For example, people tend to use West Oxfordshire, Woking and places like that, which have spending power of between £1,500 and £1,900 per household\n; \nif you look at areas like \nNewcastle\n and \nLiverpool\n, they will be between £3,000 and £4,500 in some cases per household.  As I say, they have a much higher spending power per dwelling in the first place.\n&#xa0;\nQ16 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nChris Williamson: That is because there is a great deal more deprivation.  I think you would accept that.\nBrandon Lewis: They have deprivation to\n deal with; that is why they have \nthis higher grant\n in the first place.  My point is you \ncannot do a direct comparison of somewhere that is\n getting £4,500 per dwelling \nin spending\n with somewhere that is getting about £1,800 and argue that \nthe one that is getting \n£\n1,800 is better off.\n&#xa0;\nQ17 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nChris Williamson: We constantly get into this battle, \nthough, \ndo\nn’t\n we\n, between this definition of spending power and grant settlements?  There is a \nconstan\nt\n tension, it seems, between DCLG’s interpretation of\n what the figures are saying and your arguing, “These \nmore deprived areas are doing better in a sense because\n they have got more to start with”.  I just wonder, therefore, what your thoughts would be about \nwhether it is time to have a local government equivalent of\n the Office for Budget Responsibility.  That would then settle it, would it not?  Would you \nsupport that?\nBrandon Lewis: I do not think there is anything to settle.  I appreciate you do not\n know the spending power for Derby at the moment, but I think you will find, if you look at it, it is much higher than West Oxfordshire in the first place.  That is quite a simple fact.  It is the same for \nNewcastle\n, Liverpoo\nl\n, Leeds and \nManchester\n; they are much higher than the more affluent areas.  \n&#xa0;\nQ18 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nChris Williamson: What about the point\n, though, about a local government equivalent of the Office for Budget \nResponsibility?\nBrandon Lewis: \nThe problem is y\nou are also looking at it from the point of view of the\n grant settlement.  Bear in mind, of course, 70% of local authorities’ money—it used to be 50%—now is locally derived.  That will \nhopefully grow as we see economic growth.  You also have to bear in \nmind we are working within a constrict in which we are having to reduce the deficit and pay down, eventually, the debt that was inherited from the last Government.  T\nhe Secretary of State \nmade the point to you\n last w\ne\nek\n that\n, with local government accounting for\n about a quarter of all \nGovernment expenditure, it has a big part to play.  If the authorities that are getting the largest part of the grant are losing 2.9% of their funding, in cash terms that will be a different figure compared \nwith \nsome\nwhere \nthat gets a much smaller grant in the first place.\n&#xa0;\nQ19 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nChris Williamson: Can I \njust press you one final time with regard to this point about a \nlocal government equivalent of the Office\n for Budget Responsibility?  I accept you \nare making the argument that the Government’s figures are reasonable, but there is this tension that a lot of people would take issue with your\n interpretation.  In terms of taking the tension and the politics out of it \nsomewhat, if we had that equivalent of an Office \nfor B\nudget Responsibility for local\n g\novernment finance\n, that would settle this argument once and for all, would it not?  No matter how strongly you argue today \nthat the Government is being fair and reasonable, there will be many voices in\n local government who say, “Well, I am sorry; that is just \ndisingenuous\n”\n.\nBrandon Lewis: The \nOffice for Budget Responsibility \nlooks at\n Government expenditure, so you could argue that \na part of\n DCLG is within what the Office for Budget Responsibility looks at\n.  I am sure that is\n an argument, if you want to put it, we can debate in a backbench business d\nebate \nor a Westminster Hall debate \nat some stage in the future.\n&#xa0;\nQ20 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nChris Williamson: As far\n as you are concerned at the moment, then, you would not necessarily \nsupport—\nBrandon Lewis: I am not sure\n what it particularly would add to the fact that, at DCLG, we have to set a budget for local government; we have to work out \nwhat the\n grant settlement is for local government.  That is \nchanging dramatically, because local government itself is\n controlling more and more of its own finances; less and less of it, regardless of who is \nsitting in my chair and what party they are fr\nom, \nis\n going to be coming from central Government.  As I say, it has already \nmoved from roughly \n55% or 56% to 70% in the last \ncouple \nof years.  As \nthe economy grows, hopefully that will grow and local authorities, as a result of that, will become more and more autonomous.  That, in the long run, \nhas to be good for them.  \n&#xa0;\nQ21 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nChair: Minister, you talked about the propo\nr\ntion of spending\n that local government takes in terms of the national cake, so you \nwould expect, therefore, there to be a reasonable proportion of any reductions in local government.  Is it fair, therefore, that from 2010-2011 to 2014-2015, local \ngovernment will see the cash made available to it from central Government decline by \n15\n% but central Government itself, on its own expenditure—its own direct services—will have increased its cash spend by \n15\n%?\nBrandon Lewis: As I said, local government has got a huge part to play.  It has still got a lot further to go.  \n&#xa0;\nQ22 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nChair: A \n15\n% cut\n for local government; a 15% increase for central Government.  It is \nnot very fair, is it?\nBrandon Lewis: \nWe are down about 60% in terms of our reductions at DCLG, so w\ne do practise what we preach.  We \neven go as far as sharing, effectively, our chief executive—our Permanent Secretary—and we are going to be \nmoving our offices to be even more cost\n- \neffective this year.  \n&#xa0;\nQ23 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nChair: \nIt is not the real question, is it?\n  15% increase in cash for central Government as a whole; \n15% reduction \nin cash \nfor\n local government.  It is not very fair, is it?\nBrandon Lewis: Local government is still\n spending more than it did last year.  It is up at £117 \nbillion from \n£114 \nbillion.  The actual spend in local government and the amount of money it has in reserves is showing local government is still doing a very good job.\n  \n&#xa0;\nQ24 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nChair: 15% down in\n cash in four years.  \nBrandon Lewis: \nIt went from £114 billion last year to £117 billion \nthis year.  It \nhas managed to increase its reserves and keep \nproviding good services.\n&#xa0;\nQ25 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nChair: \nCan you justify the fairness of why local government has been picked out for the \nbiggest cuts of all?\nBrandon Lewis: \nThere are certain departments that have been protected, because t\nhe Government took a political \ndecision about what was to be protected.  Local government is responsible for about 25% of all Government expenditure, so it is\n going to end up taking a\n \nbig c\nh\nunk \nof the savings that have to be made.  \nWe have to pay down that debt and deficit, and it has to come from somewhere.  \nEqually, w\ne\n have given the power to local authorities\n to be more in control of their own finances as they go forward.  As I said earlier, some authorities \nhave\n seen increases in \ntheir g\nr\nant \nmoney \nfrom Government \nthrough the incentive schemes.  \n&#xa0;\nQ26 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nJohn Pugh: I have\n some questions on timing, but ca\nn\n I just\n take you back to a previous question probed by our C\nhairman?  What we \nare \ntrying to\n find out is whether there is a change of \nprinciple behind the allocation of resources.  I think you said \nsomething like \nyou\n \nwanted to move\n away from a “begging-bowl”—that is the expression you used—system to \nincentivising local authorities\n.  Is that what you said?\nBrandon Lewis: Yes.\n&#xa0;\nQ27 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nJohn Pugh: I do not think councils\n traditionally beg, but they do expect that their funding is somehow a \nreflection of a needs assessment.  Are you saying that you want to move away from a\n \nneeds-based s\ny\nstem of funding local authorities\n to a different system not based on need?\nBrandon Lewis: Need is built into the baseline that is there for the \nbusiness rates retention scheme.  The business rates retention scheme, the New \nHomes Bonus, the Efficiency Support Grant and the Transformation Challenge Award are\n \nmoving the \ngrant\n&#x2011;\nbased\n part \ninto an \nincentive-based system; absolutely.  \n&#xa0;\nQ28 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nJohn Pugh: So you are moving away from\n a needs system.\nBrandon Lewis: \nThe needs system is built into the baseline, but where you move from there is incentive-\nbased, yes.\n&#xa0;\nQ29 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nJohn Pugh: If you do that, would it not follow that over time\n those authorities that have great needs but limited opportunities will \ncontinue to have less money to spend and those areas that have limited needs but huge opportunities—like, for example\n, Oxfordshire with its house building—will continue to do better?  Is that not the obvious \ntrend that will result?\nBrandon Lewis: No.  I would argue that is an unfair assessment of some of the authorities\n.\n \n When I meet local authorities, whether it is from the north-west, the north-east, the midlands or a\nnywhere else\n, they \ntalk about wanting\n opportunities for growth, and what they can do to see businesses grow and \ndevelop business\n.  T\nhere is a real appetite for that\n out there, and if they do that and they drive forward with that, they will see \nthe benefit.  \nIn my area, where we have big issues with \ndeprivation \nin a couple of wards, \nthe energy industry is driving the economy forward; in parts of the \nn\north\n-e\nast \nthere is a similar effect. \nI do\n not necessarily think just because a \ncouncil has in the past relied purely on a\n needs-based formula that they should not be able to be incentivised by a growth formula.  \n&#xa0;\nQ30 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nJohn Pugh: I am perfectly happy to accept that\n councils may seriously underestimate the economic opportunities they have \nin front of them, but there are certain areas of the country that\n every economist would acknowledge offer greater opportunities than others—say, for example, the s\nouth\n-e\nast compared\n with the north-east.  That will continue to be the case regardless, won’t it\n?\nBrandon Lewis: Do\n not forget that there is a baseline, so it is\n about the growth that they show.  Some areas of the south-east would argue that there is a limited amount of space \nfor them to grow business rates because they\n have so much there in the first place, whereas other parts of the country \nthat have not got so much have more room for growth and\n to develop more space for businesses.  That argument can be played \neither way round, and I have heard authorities\n make that both ways.  You have to also bear in mind, as I say, that it starts with a baseline that does build in needs through the \nfour bands.\n&#xa0;\nQ31 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nJohn Pugh: With regard to timing now, the settlement was announced over the\n Christmas period and local authorities, many of whom are now making \neconomies by closing down over the\n Christmas period, had 17 days \nto respond.  Why was it done like that?\nBrandon Lewis: We do the settlement\n after the autumn statement.  \n&#xa0;\nQ32 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nJohn Pugh: Was it because\n the autumn statement was so late?\nBrandon Lewis: Yes.  \nActually, it \nwas\n \na pretty similar\n timeframe to the year before.  Bear in mind this year was much easier for authorities, because the previous year we gave a two-year \nindication, and t\nh\ne changes \nthat came \nthrough this year from the\n original indication were generally beneficial for them, so authorities had a pretty good \nlead-in time this \nyear\n.  \nIn t\nhe same\n way, this year we have given them an indication \nfor next year.\n&#xa0;\nQ33 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nJohn Pugh: But \nyou have been a council leader yourself; you would have preferred probably more lead-in.\nBrandon Lewis: \nI do appreciate authorities make the case \nthey would like the settlement earlier.  I have absolute sympathy with\n why they want that, which is why last year we gave them effectively a year’s \nnotice.  To me, it is difficult for them to argue this year \nthey did not have enough notice when\n \nthey\n had about a year’s notice. \n&#xa0;\nQ34 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nJohn Pugh: What about the council tax referendum threshold?  \nThat \nis\n quite critical, and it is something that has been quite confused \nin recent years.  Could you not have \nestablished that earlier?  That was irrespective of the numbers the Budget \ncame up with, \nwasn’t it\n?\nBrandon Lewis: We gave an indication it certainly will not be more than 2%.  We\n will make a final decision and a recommendation to Parliament very shortly.  \n&#xa0;\nQ35 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nJohn Pugh: Why is it not possible to do it earlier?\nBrandon Lewis: Through the consultation,\n we have had representations—\nJohn Pugh: \nWell, b\negin the consultation earlier.\nBrandon Lewis: We cannot \nstart \nthe\n consultation until after we have done the draft settlement.  T\nhrough that consultation, we had representations \nabout \nthe\n referendum level.  Last year, there was a variation in the \nreferendum \nprinciple\n levels for some authorities because of the de \nminimis\n.  \n&#xa0;\nQ36 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nJohn Pugh: \nThere was confusion about the referendum threshold, wasn’t there?\nBrandon Lewis: Last year, it was local authorities\n who argued for de \nminimis\n, which we put in, which was welcomed by \nthose \nauthorities\n.  This year\n, there have been authorities making a case for a lower referendum threshold \nthan 2%, and we are looking at that.  \n&#xa0;\nQ37 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: Minister, is the Local Government Association accurate when it says that the cut in central funding for council tax support to 2016 “could be as much as £\n1 \nbillion”?\nBrandon Lewis: The Local Government Association has from time t\no\n time made claims\n about what it thinks might happen.  In the past, local authorities have made claims about \nthe council tax freeze grant.  They \nhave \nargue\nd\n there is a cliff edge\n because of where they think that will end.  That is why this year we have made it very clear that it is in the baseline, so there \nis not this cliff edge coming, but it would\n also be a bit beyond my purview to go beyond the \nspending round.\n&#xa0;\nQ38 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: What \nis \nyour estimate of what it is, then?\nBrandon Lewis: As\n I \nsay, we have given the settlement this year; we have given an indication of next year.  I am not going to be \njudging now what might happen in the settlement after that, but we have rolled\n the freeze grant into the baseline so that we avoid the cliff edge that some authorities thought they might face if they took the council tax freeze grant.\n That simply is not there now\n.  Coming b\nack to the point Dr Pugh made about \nthe referend\nums \nlevels, the Government would really like all authorities to take the freeze grant and freeze the council tax to help people.\n&#xa0;\nQ39 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: Let us, Minister, turn to what \nwas the Social Fund, which has been devolved to local authorities.  Could you just very \nbriefly give the Committee a flavour of what \nvulnerable \npeople use\n crisis loans and community care grants for?\nBrandon Lewis: It would be\n a \nrange of \nthings\n.  A lot of authorities \nhave \nnot had it taken up fully, but it\n would be for a range of things, around needing money in an emergency for whatever it \nhappens to be for that\n particular person at that particular time in that area.\n&#xa0;\nQ40 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: So people\n needing a cooker because it is broken, \nor something like that\n, to be able to warm up food to be able to feed the children.  Things like that.  \nBrandon Lewis: It could be a \nw\nhole\n range of things.  \n&#xa0;\nQ41 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: Yes.  Like that\n.  Vulnerable people in real need.\nBrandon Lewis: \nYes.  \n&#xa0;\nQ42 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: \nI am right in saying the Government passed the responsibility for this \ntype \nof safety net \ndown to local \nauthorities \nto administer\n.  They reduced the amount.  It was £175 \nmillion in 2013-2014; it has gone down to\n £172 million in 2014-2015.  The Government said at the time when they \nintroduced this and\n \npassed it to local authorities that they would carry out an assessment\n after the first 12 months, but you now know, as I do, that just before Christmas the Government announced that \nthey were stopping funding it\n completely.  That is right, isn’t it?\nBrandon Lewis: Yes.  The Department \nfor \nWork and Pensions made that\n announcement a couple of weeks ago.  \n&#xa0;\nQ43 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: So local authorities have to\n fund that £172 million or £174 million now, do they?\n  \nBrandon Lewis: Yes, although some local authorities, including some of the larger ones, were finding that they were not using it, and they were closing the schemes; they were not getting the call for it\n.  \n&#xa0;\nQ44 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: So there was a \ndemand\n for £178\n&#xa0;\nmillion-worth of\n—\nBrandon Lewis: \nI do not know what the actual demand was, but I know it was not the full amount.  \n&#xa0;Q45 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: We know\n what it was from when the DWP administered it.\nBrandon Lewis: \nI know what the DWP had allowed for it, but I believe there were some authorities that were not using the full amount.  \n&#xa0;\nQ46 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: \nBut we know what the demand was.  \nBrandon Lewis: We know what the \nclaim levels\n were, yes.  \n&#xa0;\nQ47 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: So it has gone from\n £178\n&#xa0;\nmillion, or around that figure, in parts of the country to zero.  T\nhat is\n what you are claiming, is it?  \nBrandon Lewis: I have not got the\n exact figures in front of me, so I am \nnot going to pre-judge.\n&#xa0;\nQ48 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: Fair enough.  Would you not share my view that government—whether it be\n central or local—should really be the crisis-lender of last resort \nfor vulnerable people?\nBrandon Lewis: Again, what local authorities do\n has to be decided according to what they feel the priorities are for their \nlocal areas.  It is one of the reasons\n that local authorities now have that \ngeneral power of competence to look at\n what they think is right for their area.  They have also to bear in mind \nwe are all living in a fiscal\n envelope in which we are still dealing with the debt and deficit of the last Government, and that has to be paid down.  \n&#xa0;\nQ49 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: By vulnerable people.\nBrandon Lewis: By\n all of us\n, unfortunately.  The previous Government spent money it did not have, and we now have to make cuts in the expenditure of central Government \nto get that deficit down. \n&#xa0;\nSimon Danczuk: By vulnerable people not being able to get a cooker\n to be able to warm food to feed their children.  \nThey have to\n help pay the deficit down.  \nBrandon Lewis: That is not what I said, \nMr Danczuk.\n&#xa0;\nQ50 &#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nSimon Danczuk: Minister, you said that some local authorities\n,\n spending only 1% of the money given to them by central Government\n,\n will choose, and have already chosen—and they have, because I have done research on this—not to provide this \nhelp \nat all.  They are not being the crisis-lender of last\n resort, so some people will not get any help whatsoever, and you are comfortable with that.\nBrandon Lewis: I would make the point that\n local authorities have a duty to their local communities.  If, in a local community, there is a n\need for that, those councillors in \nthat authority \nshould\n look at what the priorities are \nfor \ntheir \nlocal authority\n and how they spend their budget accordingly\n.\n  That is a matter for the local authority.  \n&#xa0;\nQ51 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: The only alternative for\n many vulnerable people as a result of this change in policy—and you have decided \nnot eve\nn\n to assess it before the time is up on it\n—will be payday lenders.  What the Government \nhave effectively done in many parts of the coun\nt\nry is privatise\n—because these are private companies—crisis-lending \nto vulnerable\n people.  That is a fair assessment, isn’t it?\nBrandon Lewis: No, I would not agree \nwith \nthat.  As I\n say, it is a matter of the priorities that are decided on by the local authority and the councillors on those local authorities.  \n&#xa0;\nQ52 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: Would you \ngive a\n guarantee that all\n local authorities will provide some sort of support?\nBrandon Lewis: I can\nnot give that guarantee, \nbecause\n that is a matter for the local authorities.\n&#xa0;\nQ53 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nHeather Wheeler: Minister, can I take you back to \nconversations i\nn the autumn statement for\n 2012\n?  I am particularly thinking about the business\n \nrate relief.  There have now been other statements for 2013 as well.  Very understandably and, from my point of view, laudably, the 50% relief for small businesses was extended and it has been a great success, but at the time councils had budgeted for that money to come in and out of their coffers and it stopped.  The councils\n are still waiting for\n that agreed amount of money to come back in.  Are you any closer to being able \nto give a date when 70% \nof it \nor 90% of it might come their way?\nBrandon Lewis: I cannot give \nyou a date now, but, if you will allow me, I will write to you on that.  \nHeather Wheeler: Thank you very much indeed.\n&#xa0;\nQ54 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nJohn Stevenson: \nThe business \nrates retention scheme\n \nwas introduced\n to incentivise local authorities to promote business and economic growth \nin their area, \nbut, \naccording to the LGA, \nless than a third of councils believe that the business\n \nrate retention scheme provides sufficient incentives\n.  What do you say to that?\nBrandon Lewis: The proof will be in the \npudding over the next couple of years.  We will get the first full set of NNDR figures at the end of this week—so the business rates take-up.  I appreciate there will be local authorities who would argue they would like a bigger share of the pie, but, again, we are working in a constrained\n fiscal environment.  I\nt is an incentive for them.  If they get\n growth from business, they will get the benefit through more income through the business rates.  \nThere is an incentive there, and my hope is that \nauthorities \nwill\n seize that and take advantage of it.  When I meet local authorities, a large number of them are very keen on moving forward with that, but, \nlike any organisation, they\n would like to move further and faster.  \nI have great \nrespect for that, but we are all working in constrained \nfiscal environments.\n&#xa0;\nQ55 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nJohn Stevenson: Why should\nn’t\n we just move to\n the point where all business rates growth is retained?\nBrandon Lewis: There is \njust \na pretty simple \nanswer to that, which is that \nthat has an impact on public e\nxpenditure\n, and it is unrealistic to \nthink that central Government and the Treasury are not going to want to make sure that we have a grip \non that kind of expenditure.  To see it move\n much beyond where it is now in the near future, while \nwe are where we are economically—\n&#xa0;\nQ56 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nJohn Stevenson: \nBut would you not agree with me that if you did move towards the local authorities being able to retain the whole amount, t\nhat would be a real incentive for \nthem to promote economic growth, \nwhich would then\n benefit the wider economy?\nBrandon Lewis: That is a fair point.  It depends\n on how you do it, in the sense that if every local authority kept its entire business rates for its area, then that \ngoes even further down the road in terms of the\n equalisation of the funding that goes to authorities.  C\nertain authorities\n who have a massive business rates income, \nsuch as those around where we are sitting right now, \nwould be at a massive advantage to \nauthorities in more rural areas, more deprived areas or areas of lower business levels.  That is why we have set the baseline and then it is \nabout growth.  It is not just giving people the benefit of the businesses they have already got; it is incentivising them to get the benefit from growth.  As I\n say, some form \nof long-term control over local \ngovernment finance\n from the centre is not entirely unrealistic in the sense of where we are \neconomically.  \n&#xa0;\nQ57 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nDavid Heyes: Just to \nfollow up on what were you were saying then, whether the councils keep the entire business rates\n or it is just a ma\nt\nter of growth, how do you square that\n with the fact that the Prime Minister this morning announced that the Federation of Small Businesses is going to act to reduce the business \nrate burden?\nBrandon Lewis: We are say\ni\nng to local authorities, “If you\n develop more businesses, you will benefit from business rate growth”.  \nDavid Heyes: \nBut t\nhe \nPrime \nMinister\n is going to cut the amount of business rates and therefore cut the resources that are available to local authorities.  \nChair: We will have to suspend the session.\n&#xa0;\n              \nSitting suspended for a Division in the House. \n              \nOn resuming—\n&#xa0;\nQ58 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nChair: David, do you\n just want to repeat the question that you raised and then we will carry on \nfrom there?\nDavid Heyes: \nYes.  \nAll \nof \nthese\n discussions about devolving power to local areas in one way or \nanother seem to hinge on the idea of giving greater power over business rates, and retaining a greater amount of the business rates within the local community.  That seems to me\n \nnot \nto sit well with the Prime Minister’s\n announcement this morning that central Government under him would act \nto reduce business rates.\nBrandon Lewis: There are a couple of things.  Local authorities\n have the power now to offer business rates discounts if they want to and if they feel they can afford\n it.  We part-fund that.  The idea\n behind that, just briefly, is they might want to use that to incentivise businesses to come in and get going, \nand then eventually \nthey \nbenefit from the business rates down the line\n; it is an investment\n.  What the Prime Minister was referring to\n particularly focused on the package that was announced in the autumn statement, around the £1,000 discount, which is particularly beneficial for high streets and town centres; the small-\nbusiness rate relief\n; and the re-occupation \nrelief that will come in\n.  T\nhat is\n central Government funded, so the local authorities will not \nlose out from that.  They \ncould \nactually \nbenefit\n.  O\nnce we get those business\nes in and once they get going, they can benefit \nin the long run.  \nChair: We \nare going to \nhave to\n suspend again; I am sorry.  \n&#xa0;\n              \nSitting suspended for a Division in the House. \n              \nOn resuming—\n&#xa0;\nQ59 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nChair: Minister, for the third time, could\n you have a go at answering the question from \nDavid \nHeyes\n?  \nBrandon Lewis: I think I had kind of finished\n answering, but yes, I will.  I would also just like to take the opportunity to say—these breaks do give me an opportunity to double-check things—just in terms of Mrs Wheeler’s query around the business rates money coming back to local authorities, b\ny the time she gets\n the letter from me explaining it, the authorities will probably \nalready have had the letter giving \nthem \nthe details\n, but I will write to her.  It is imminent; it is \nalready signed off.  \nThe point I was making to Mr \nHeyes\n is that the Prime Minister was referring to the package that was put out \nas part of the \nautumn statement\n that\n is central Government funded.  There is a £1,000 discount for \nsmall businesses, in particular in the\n retail sector and the high-street, town-centre \nsector.  It is a really good thing \nthat \nthe\n Government has been able to recognise business rates are a pressure on businesses.  There is also a discount in there \nfor getting businesses and properties back into use for\n 18 months.  That is a really good thing.  Yes, that does mean there is a discount \non those business rates\n, which is central Government funded for that period, but then \nafter that, there is a chance for those businesses to survive.  It just\n gives them that opportunity to have that bit of pump-priming, for want of a better phrase.  There was a really good \npackage of things in there that \ndo \nnot cost local government\n but could well be quite a good stimulus for local government to benefit from in the \nmedium term and, \nindeed, the long term as well.  \n&#xa0;\nQ60 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nChair: Minister, finally, I will come on to the\n issue of 2.3% once again, which was the figure the Chancellor used in the spending review as to \nhow much spending for local government will fall\n in 2015-2016, a figure that the Prime Minister then \nrepeated on \nSunday Politics\n in October.  I have raised this\n with the Prime Minister; he referred me to the Chief Secretary, who told me it would all be \nrevealed when the local government finance settlement was announced.  You\n said the same when you came to the Committee.  At the time of the finance settlement, you said that you would write to me with the \nfigure explaining how\n the 2.3% \nhad been calculated and put the figures in the Library.  We have not seen anything \nyet. \nBrandon Lewis: I will chase up the letter.  I think it might \nbe on \nits way to you, but\n I will chase that up and \nmake sure you have \nthat.  I will do everything I can to make sure you have \nit this week.  What I can say is the Treasury\n’s local authority spending figure—the 2.3% you referred to—which was published back in June was \nan approximation of the total\n potential amount of funding available to councils \nin 2015-2016\n.  At \nthe Department\n, we publish spending-power figures when we do the assessment in December; \nthat in itself is based on the latest information and our methodology. \n \nThis\n year, it is 2.9% on average, and next year it will be 1.8%.\n&#xa0;\nQ61 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nChair: It would be\n \ninteresting\n to know how the 2.3% was calculated.  \nBrandon Lewis: I see your point.\nChair: Yes.  The Treasury must have had\n a way of calculating it; it cannot have been a figure they plucked out of thin air, presumably.  To see that figure and\n \nthe calculations \nwould be helpful.\nBrandon Lewis: I will chase up the letter.\n&#xa0;\nQ62 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nChair: Just in terms of\n the way figures for local government spending are dealt with in general terms, y\nou \nsaid \npreviously\n that local government spending has gone up this year.  It has gone up because \npublic health\n \nis included in the figures, has\nn’t\n it\n, and for \nno other reason\n?\nBrandon Lewis: \nSpending power covers the money the local authorities have influence over and decisions over \nin terms of the s\np\nend\n within their local communities.\n&#xa0;\nQ63 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nChair: But spending\n would have gone down if public health was not included.  Is that \nright?\nBrandon Lewis: I would have to chec\nk\n that.  I \nwould \nnot want to\n give you a definitive answer on that, because it depends on how the business rates retention works in.  I am \nnot sure, but I can confirm that for you.\n&#xa0;\nQ64 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nChair: Right.  You can\n \nhave a look at it.  \nW\ne see figures\n about local government spend in future years, but they include, don’t they, this NHS money of \n£1.1\n&#xa0;\nbillion next year and £3.8\n&#xa0;\nbillion the year after\n?\n  It is interesting\n that those figures also appear in the NHS spending \nfigures.  They are there to fulfil the Government’s \ncommitment \nto \nkeep NHS spending at least level \nin rea\nl terms, but they are also being\n used\n at the \nsame time to show that local government spending is not going down by as much.  \nIs that not double counting?\nBrandon Lewis: No, it is not.  It is just showing what is available for a local authority to have influence and decisions over.  One of the things I would stress and, while I am on the record, I think \nit \nis a really important point to make, is that the local authorities are involved in the Better Care Fund negotiations at the moment—I have been very open about this; so has Norman Lamb, the Minister at Health I am working with on this—to make sure that we get something different, that it is a proper partnership, and that the local authorities are involved in the decision\n \nmaking and involved in the planning of the service that is going to be there.  That is not just because they have influence over it, but also because it is how we get the better outcome in the end.\n  It is a really important shift, and it is a massive opportunity for\n local government to show that local government is a vehicle that can facilitate bringing the public sector \ntogether in a way we have not been able to achieve \nas widely as some of us would have liked in the past.  Community budgets have proven it works.  T\nhe \ntransformation \nnetwork is\n taking that further forward.  The Better Care Fund is a \nmassive opportunity for local government\n to really step up and prove that.  \n&#xa0;\nQ65 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nChair: Minister, I was not taking\n any issue with the policy, which I think is a \nvery good idea to try to join \nu\np the approach.\nBrandon Lewis: \nNo, I appreciate that, but it is part of what local authorities will have—that influence and decision-making power.\n&#xa0;\nQ66 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nChair: Is it \nreasonable\n and fair accounting practice to include\n that amount of money both in the NHS spend and in the local government spend \nin the same set of accounts?\nBrandon Lewis: It is NHS money, but it is local authorities\n who will be involved in the planning of it and decisions about how it is spent.  \n&#xa0;\nQ67 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nChair: \nYes, but it \ncannot be \nshown \ntwice in the \naccounts\n.  Is that fair?  \nIs that not trying to get the same sum of money and saying, “It is there for NHS purposes because it justifies the policy there, and \nthen we include it\n in the local government spend as well”?  It \ncannot be both.\nBrandon Lewis: No, because \nwe are not saying \nlocal \ngovernment \nspending power\n is the grant money central Government gives just to local government and is not part of anything else; s\npending power \noutlines \nthe\n money that is spent in a local area that a local authority makes decisions on or has influence over.  T\nhat has not changed.  That \nB\nette\nr\n Care Fund will be \nan increasingly important part of that, particularly for the authorities dealing with adult social care.  \n&#xa0;\nQ68 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nChair: It is true, is it, therefore, that\n in terms of local government spending power, that \nsame amount \nof \nmoney is included\n under local government spending and under NHS spending?\nBrandon Lewis: It is included in the spending power.\n&#xa0;\nChair: And it\n is included in the NHS budget as well.  It is the same money.\nBrandon Lewis: It is part of the NHS budget, yes.\n&#xa0;\nQ69 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nBob Blackman: I apologise for not being here when we were talking about the\n allocation of resources.  My understanding for 2015-2016 is that for \nLondon\n councils the New Homes Bonus is being \nincluded in their spending power, but for the rest of the\n country it is not.  Can you explain the inconsistency \nin that approach?\nBrandon Lewis: It is being spent across \nLondon\n \nthrough \nthe\n local enterprise partnership.  In the rest of the country, that money has gone back into the local authorities following the consultation over the summer.  I am not quite sure \nwhat you mean in terms of spending power.\n&#xa0;\nQ70 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nBob Blackman: My understanding is\n that what is being talked about for \nLondon\n authorities in terms of their spending power \nincludes New Homes Bonus money\n for 2015-2016.\nBrandon Lewis: The New Homes Bonus\n is in the spending power for all authorities.  The difference in \nLondon\n is that, \nin other areas, the New Homes Bonus money\n goes back to that district authority or that local council; in \nLondon\n it is pooled \nthrough the LEP, because \nLondon\n \nhas\n a\n rather unique structure—\nin terms of how it delivers housing\n.  \nLondon\n is \npooled, and the team in \nLondon\n are working together at the moment to get the right structure to govern how they spend that, with all the local authorities \nin \nLondon\n.\n&#xa0;\nQ71 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nBob Blackman: That then gives an inconsistent pattern\n.  When the figures are being looked at in terms of how much reduction there is, given that \nthe \nLondon\n authorities\n will have no control over that money whatsoever, their spending power has been reduced even more than the figures would \npurport to suggest.\nBrandon Lewis: \nNo, t\nhat is not \nnecessarily \nthe case.\n  \nIt is money for \nLondon\n \nauthorities.  It will go into \nLondon\n; it will be spent in \nLondon\n.  \n&#xa0;\nQ72 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nBob Blackman: \nBut the local authority will not have the power to spend that money.  That \nis the key.\nBrandon Lewis: It depends on what the final structure is, but they \nmay well \nbe\n involved in deciding how that money is spent.  They have \nnot decided that yet.  It depends on\n how they structure what they do, but it will not be for the individual local authorities, no, because it has been \npooled.\n&#xa0;\nQ73 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nBob Blackman: \nThat is correct.  So it is different.  \nBrandon Lewis: \nIt is different in \nLondon\n.\n&#xa0;Q74 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nBob Blackman: \nA local authority outside \nLondon\n \nwould \nh\nave their spending power reflected\n with the New Homes Bonus money allocated to them to spend \nas they wish, but that will not be the case for \nLondon\n local authorities.  For example, \nif \nthey\n wanted to take that money and use it for another purpose, my understanding is they are not able to do that.  \nBrandon Lewis: It will be up to the enterprise\n partnership how they spend the \nmoney because it has been pooled.  It will be spent in London by London\n authorities, but it will not be under the control of the individual authority.\n&#xa0;\nQ75 &#xa0;&#xa0; \nBob Blackman: This London-wide body could decide to spend all the money\n in one borough in east \nLondon\n, and that would be fine.  A\nll the\n rest of the \nLondon\n authorities would \nlose out, and that would be perfectly okay, but the spending\n power would not be there for another \nLondon\n authority.  That is the \nkey issue.\nBrandon Lewis: In theory, \nI assume \nthat is technically possible, but it depends on how they\n get the governance structure set up in \nLondon\n to make the decisions.  I \ndo not think there are any local \nauthorities in London that I have met—I have met most of the London authorities over the last few weeks—who have fears over \none body deciding to spend all the money in one \nauthority that they are not happy with.  It is about recognising the issue of that duty to co-operate to make sure you get the money for the \nhousing structure spent correctl\ny\n in \nLondon\n.  \nLondon\n is\n being treated differently from the rest of the country, because \nLondon\n has a \nunique structure compared \nwith \nthe rest of the coun\nt\nry.\nChair: Minister, thank you\n very much indeed for coming back for a third time to see us this afternoon.  T\nhank you very much.  \n&#xa0;\n              \nOral evidence: \nfiscal devolution to cities and city regions HC 1018\n              \n              \n2\n"
