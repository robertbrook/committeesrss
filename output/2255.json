"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Department for Work and Pensions&#xa0;&#xa0;1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nO\nn \n22 \nDecember 201\n0\n, the Work and Pensions Select Committee published the report ‘Changes to Housing Benefit announced in the 2010 \nBudget’. This\n set out the Committee’s recommendations \nin relation to the implementation of the reforms.\n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Government provided its response to the report \nin March 2011, which the Committee published \nat\n:\nhttp://www.publicati\no\nns.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmworpen/845/84504.htm\n1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe written evidence \nprovides an \nupdate\n to\n the Committee on progress with the implementation of \nthe Department’s reforms \nto support for housing costs. \nIt seeks \nto address the individual lines of enquiry \nin which \nthe Committee \nis \nparticularly interested. \n&#xa0;\n2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are currently 5.1 million people in \nGreat Britain\n in receipt of housing be\nnefit. The housing benefit bill increased significantly over the past decade, by around 50 \nper cent in real terms. In 2012/\n13, estimated expenditure was £24 billion.\n If unreformed, expenditure on h\nousing \nb\nenefit would\n have \nbe\nen\n over £26 billion by \n2014/\n15.\n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs part of its fiscal consolidation programme, the Government has introduced a number of changes to housing benefit\n, which save over £2 billion by 2014/15\n.\n \nT\nh\ne first sections of this \nwritten evidence \nprovide\n update\ns\n on:\n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nnext \nsection covers \nthe replacement of \nc\nouncil \nt\nax \nb\nenefit by council tax reduction schemes, designed and administered loca\nlly.\n2.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhere is\n \nthen \nan update on \nthe \nstructural changes \nthat \nreplace \nh\nousing \nb\nenefit \nwith the housing \ncosts \nelement of Universal Credit\n \nand a reformed scheme \nfor pensioners.\n \nThis includes \nthe plans to protect vulnerable groups through\n managed payment of ren\nt\n to landlords, and special arrangements for\n claimants \nin supported and temporary accommodation.\n2.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFinally, there is a\n section on support for home owners. This gives a\nn update on \ns\nupport for \nm\nortgage \ni\nnterest\n and \nsets out \nthe treatment of home owners in Universal Credit and \nthe reformed scheme for \npensioners\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nReforms to Local Housing Allowance (LHA) introduced from April 2011 included setting the rates at the 30th percentile \nrather th\nan the median \nof market rents, \ncapping the maximum LHA rates\n, \nremoving the 5\n-bed\n rate\n and no longer allowing claimants to retain any excess of up to £15 a week between the\nir actual rent and the\n LHA rate.\n  From January 2012, the \nupper \nage \nlimit \nfor the LHA \nshared accommodation rate for single people \nwithout dependent children \nwas \nraised \nfrom 25 to 35.\n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor all these reforms, claimants had up to \nnine \nmonths\n’\n transitional protection from their anniversary date, so only started to be affected \nbetween January 2012 and \nDecember\n 2012\n.  The \nDepartment is \nproviding\n \n£40 million in Discretionary Housing Payments\n \nin 2013/14\n \nto \nhelp\n people \nmake the transition to \nthe \nLHA \nreforms.\n3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Department has commissioned an independent evaluation of the reforms, b\ny a consortium led by \nSheffield\n \nHallam\n \nUniversity\n. The\n \ni\nnterim \nr\neport\n was \npublished in May 2013\n:\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/monitoring-the-impact-of-changes-to-the-local-housing-allowance-system-of-housing-benefit-interim-report-rr-838\n3.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn April 2013, following the announcement made in the June 2010 Budget, increases \nin\n LHA \nrates \nwere limited \nusing \nthe Consumer Prices Index (\nCPI\n) \nof \nSeptember 2012\n. \nRates \nhave \nbeen increased \neither \nby \nCPI\n \ninflation \nor \nto \nthe 30th percentile of \nmarket \nrents\n, whichever is the lower\n.\n3.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Chancellor announced in his \nAutumn Statement \nof \n2012\n that \nincreases in LHA rates \nwould be limited \nto 1 per cent in 2014/15 and 2015/16\n. As a result, most LHA rates will be increased in \nApril 2014 and April 2015\n \neither \nby 1 per cent or \nto \nthe\n 30th percentile of market rents, whichever is the lower\n.  \n3.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Chancello\nr also \nannounced that\n 30 per cent of the forecast savings \nfrom this measure \nwould be used \nas Targeted Affordability Funding \nto increase the LHA rates in some areas by more than 1 per cent, where rent increases are causing a shortage of affordable accommoda\ntion\n.\n3.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Department intends to announce \nin \nthe \nautumn \nhow the funding will be targeted\n. This will take account of responses to the \nc\nall \nf\nor \ne\nvidence \nthat took place \nin July.\n&#xa0;\n4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince \nApril 2013\n, the removal of the \nspare room subsidy \nmeans that \nworking-age tenants in the social sector receive \nh\nousing \nb\nenefit for the number of bedrooms their household needs, bringing the rules in\nto\n line with the private sector.\n4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn December 2011, the Department announced \nthe provision \nof £30 million per annum in Discretionary Housing Payments for 2013/14 and 2014/15 \nto help people \nmake the \ntransition to the change\n. Of this, £\n25\n \nm\nillion\n \nper annum \nis specifically to help those living in significantly adapted accommodation who \nare affected\n \nby the measure.\n4.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn July 2013, t\nhe \nDepartment \nannounced \nfurther\n in-year funding \nof £35 million, again \nto help claimants \nwith the transition to the change\n. This comprised:\n4.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI\nn total\n, the Department is \nproviding\n \n£180 million \nof Discretionary Housing Payment funding in \n2013/14\n to cover all the welfare reforms, including ‘core’ funding of £20 m\nillion p.a.\n4.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nDepartment has commissioned \na\nn independent evaluation \nof the \npolicy \nacross \nGreat Britain\n.\n The consortium \nis led by Ipsos \nMORI and includes the Cambridge Centre for Housing and Planning Research and \nthe \nInstitute for Fiscal Studies.\n Initial findings will be available in 2014 and the final report is due in 2015.\n&#xa0;\n5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNon-dependants are people who live in a benefit claimant’s household who are not dependant children, for instance adult children, other relatives and friends. \nIt is a long-established principle \nof the benefit system \nthat \nthey \nshould be expected to contribu\nte towards the \nclaimant’s \nhousing costs. \n5.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the June 2010 Budget, the Chancellor announced a three-year staged increase in the rates o\nf non-dependant \ndeductions in housing b\nenefit \nfrom April 2011. By April 2013, these increases brought the deduction rates\n to the level they would have been had they been increased each year since 2001 to broadly reflect growth in rents. \n5.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe h\nousing \nb\nenefit non-dependant deduction scheme is based on the age and circumstances of the non-dependant, and deductions are based on standard income-bands. The gross income of the non-dependant determines into which income band the non-dependant falls, and theref\nore the deduction that should be applied. There are a range of exemptions whereby a deduction does not apply. \n5.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Department estimates\n that around 350,000 non-dependants are living in households where deductions are made. \n&#xa0;6.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe Government believes there has to be a limit to the amount of benefit \nentitlement for \npeople who are not in work. \n6.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPhased implementation \nof a cap on benefits \nstarted on \n15 April 2013\n in Croydon, Bromley, \nEnfield\n and Haringey. National rollout in other lo\ncal authorities \nbegan in July and August\n, with the expectation that all appropriate households will be capped by the end of September 2013. \n6.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nApplying the cap through housing benefit is an interim measure\n. \nIn the longer term the \nDepartment will administer t\nhe \ncap as part of the Universal Credit system.\n6.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLatest figures show around 40,000 households are likely to be affected.\n6.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe most vulnerable, including war widows, those in the support group for Employment Support Allowance, and those with severe disabilitie\ns are exempt, as are households claiming Working Tax Credit.\n \nThose in supported exempt accommodation will have their housing costs disregarded from the cap calculation. \n6.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhere is a 39 week grace period for those who have been in work for 50 of the previous\n 52 weeks immediately preceding their last day of work.\n6.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Department \nis working with local authorities to provide a wide range of labour market, housing and budgetary related support to help people adjust to the changes. \nIt has contacted t\nhose likely to \nbe affected well in advance of any change taking place so that they can access this support in good time. \n6.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nDepartment\n is providing \n£65 million in Discretionary Housing Payments \nin 2013/14 \nto help those affected by the benefit cap.\n \n6.9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA\nn evaluation of \nthe\n benefit cap\n \noperating under housing benefit \nwill be published in autumn 2014\n.\n&#xa0;\n7.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCouncil Tax Benefit was abolished in April 2013 and replaced with council tax reduction schemes, designed and administered locally. Loca\nlisation means that authorities make decisions as to how they raise revenue through council tax, and gives them a bigger stake in delivering economic growth.\n7.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCouncil Tax reduction schemes will not form part of Universal Credit, and the award of a reduction\n will have no impact on a claimant's Universal Credit entitlement. However, \nthe Department \nrecognise\ns\n that there are important interactions including impacts on work incentives.\n7.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Department has \nworked with the Department for Communities and Local Govern\nment \n(DCLG) \nto ensure that local schemes \nin \nEngland\n \ncan support improved work incentives. \nIt has \nset out the key features of Universal Credit and how local authorities can apply a \nsensible means test to U\nniversal \nC\nredit\n claimants in guidance and in the def\nault scheme. \nThe Department \nand DCLG are \nalso working to deliver data sharing so that claimants do not have to provide the same information to local authorities \nthat \nthey have already provided to \nthe Department \nfor their U\nniversal \nC\nredit\n claim.\n&#xa0;\n8.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor social sector renters, the \nhousing \ncosts \nelement of Universal Credit \n \ncomprises\n \nrent and eligible service charges\n, less \nany \nimpact from the removal of the spare room subsidy, less any \nhousing cost contributions from \nnon-dependants\n. For private sector renters, \nthe housing \ncosts \nelement \nis the \nlower of actual rent and service charges or the appropriate L\nocal Housing \nA\nllowance, \nless \nany \nhousing cost contributions from non dependants\n.\n8.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUniversal Credit contains a significa\nnt change of approach to the treatment of a \ncontribution\n to their housing costs by non-dependants.  Instead of the current complex scale of deductions that rise with the non-dependant’s income there is a single\n \nflat rate of housing cost contribution which \nwill apply, irrespective of income, to non-dependants aged 21 and over, where the person is either in work or there is an expectation that they should be working\n or \ncan return to work.   A contribution will not be expected if the person is a carer, is resp\nonsible for a young child, or is in receipt of \ncertain \ndisability benefit\ns\n.\n&#xa0;\n9.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUniversal \nCredit will help claimants prepare for work\n. The Department has designed \nthe payment arrangements to reflect those that apply to \nworking people\n. \nSupporting people to manage their finances including paying their rent will ease the transition into paid work.  \n9.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are advantages in paying the housing \ncosts \nelement of Universal Credit direct \nto \nclaimants\n, rather than \nas managed \npayme\nnts to landlords\n, the approac\nh currently operating for most housing b\nenefit claimants in the social rented sector. Direct payments \nencourage people to manage their own budget in the same way as other households. However, \nthe Department \nalso recognise\ns\n the \nimportance of stable rental income for social landlords\n, which supports them to \ndeliver\n \nnew homes\n. It has \ndevelop\ned\n Universal Credit in a way that protects \nlandlords’\n financial position.\n9.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn summer 2012, t\nhe Department established \nsix direct payment demonst\nration projects to test how monthly payments of support for housing costs paid directly to most claimants will work in Universal Credit. They will run until the end of 2013.\n9.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nE\nvidence from the \nprojects \nindicates that most people will be able to cope with ma\nnaging a monthly\n budget and paying their rent. \nHowever, the \nDepartment \nrecognises that this is a significant change and that some people will need support, \nincluding budget management. \nA \nproportion \nof claimants\n \nwill\n require \nalternative arrangements\n,\n \nincluding \nmanaged payment of rent to the landlord.\n9.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nManaged payments to landlords \nare part \nof the personal budgeting support process at three \n‘\ntouch points\n’\n wi\nthin the Universal Credit claim\n:\n9.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWorking closely with the housing sector, t\nhe Department \nwill continue to feed \nlearning from the \nd\nemonstration \np\nrojects \nand the Universal Credit Pathfinder \nin\nto \nthe development of \nUniversal Credit and the support \nframeworks \nthat claimants may need. \nThe Department \nwill consider what else might be done to address \nper\nsistent underpayment of rent, balanced against the importance of keeping the system simple and efficient to administer.\n \nOne of the main emerging \nmessage\ns \nis \nthat so\ncial landlords need to engage as early as possible with their tenants \nin order to help \nprepare them for \nthe change.\n \n&#xa0;\n10.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI\nn the short term\n,\n \nthe Department will continue to provide \nhelp towards \nthe \nhousing costs \nof \nthose living in supported exempt accommodation outside Universal Credit, through \nhousing benefit\n. \nAs a result, support for \nhousing costs will remain \nas a managed payment to the landlord. The \nDepartment has made r\negulations giving powers to pay \nh\nousing \nb\nen\ne\nfit and \nUniversal \nCredit together\n.\n10.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor the long\ner\n term, the \nDepartment \nis \ndiscussing \nwith stakeholders the feasibility of a localised solution. \nThis is a challenging reform but the Government is committed to supporting vulnerable, older and disabled people\n to lead independent and active lives in the community rather than \ntheir \nliving in more institutionalised care. \n&#xa0;11.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUniversal Credit claimants housed in temporary accommodation will receive their housing support as part of their Unive\nrsal Credit. \nIt \nwill be based on the appropriate L\nocal \nH\nousing \nA\nllowance\n rate for the household and will be subject to the benefit cap. \n11.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is unlikely that there will be significant numbers of claimants on \nUniversal Credit \nentering \ntemporary accom\nm\nodation \nin the current financial year. The Department does not therefore intend to issue additional guidance or funding to l\nocal authorities\n for 2013/14\n.\n11.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor 2014/15, t\nhe Department is developing guidance for the treatment of Universal Credit claimants in \ntemporary accommodation, which it intends to publish later this year. \n11.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Department intends to \ncontribut\ne to \nthe extra costs of providing temporary accommodation for Universal Credit \nc\nlaimants \nin 2014/15. There\n will be a single \nnational \nrate of payment \nfor management fees of £45 a week\n.\n&#xa0;\n12.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor the time being, h\nousing \nb\nenefit claimants \nwho have reached the qualifying age for Pension C\nredit will continue to receive housing b\nenefit, and those who receive the Guarantee element of Pension\n Credit will continue to receive maximum support with their rent, subject to \nany deductions for non\n-dep\nendants\n. \n12.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Welfare Reform Act 2012 allows for the introduction of a new element of Pension Credit, the Housing Credit, to provide support for rent. \n&#xa0;13.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nChancellor announced in his \nAutumn Statement of 2012 that the support for mortgage interest (\nSMI\n) temporary measures of a shorter 13 week waiting period and a higher £200,000 capital limit for working age claimants will be exte\nnded until the end of March 2015.\n13.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUniversal Credit retain\ns\n the principle of protecting home owners from repossession as far as practicable. \nThe housing \ncosts \nelement for owners is \na standard\n rate of interest on\n the\n outstanding loan up to a set capital limi\nt\n. \nThere \nis \na qualifying period before \nclaimants \nare entitled to help.\n13.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere \nare \nsome changes in Universal Credit from the scheme\n for legacy benefits\n:\n13.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Department will continue to make managed payments of s\nupport for \nm\nor\ntgage \ni\nnterest\n to the lender \nif \nthe lender is part of the M\nortgage \nI\nnterest \nD\nirect (MID)\n scheme.\n13.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nDepartment \nenvisages \nthat \nthe reformed scheme for meeting the housing costs of pensioners\n will treat home owners in a broadly similar way to Universal Cred\nit\n.\n13.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the longer \nterm, the \nDepartment \nintends to move to a system of loans rather than non-recoverable benefits for supporting the housing costs of home owners.\n20 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
