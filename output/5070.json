"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the European Alliance of Rescue Centres and Sanctuaries (EARS)&#xa0;\n1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMany of o\nur members are working\n,\n harder than ever\n,\n to deal with the negative fallout from the exotic pet trade in Europe\n, often finding themselves having to take in exotic animals that have been given up by private owners or confiscated by the au\nthorities. We also see first hand the conditions in which many of these animals have been kept – their owners unable or unwilling to provide for their complex species-specific needs. As a result \nEARS\n strongly\n belie\nves that strict regulation is required for\n the keeping of wild animals \nas pets\n -\n never more so \nthan in the case of non-human primates, where the potential for negative animal welfare is so high. \n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMaintaining the welfare of any wild animal in captivity is complicated and requires specialist knowled\nge. The keeping of primates is a particular challenge as they are highly intelligent animals with complex needs that cannot be met without significant \nexperience and skills\n. Even in the best case scenario, primates in captivity may still have their welfare impaired in some way and so the practice of doing so must always be judged by the wider benefits it incurs. \nThe provision of long term sanctuary or rescue for abandoned or\n rescued animals is one example of where keeping primates can be justifiable, providing high levels of welfare can be ensured for the animals in question.\n1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs it stands \nthe only binding legislation \nin the United Kingdom for the keeping of primates as pets i\ns based on their potential threat to public safety. While this is clearly of critical importance, it pays no attention to the welfare impacts outlined above. Indeed the most commonly traded primate species in the UK are not covered in the Dangerous Wild An\nimals Act (19\n76)\n and so trade in them is not regulated at all.\n1.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe keeping of wild animals as pets is becoming an issue of increasing interest to governments across Europe. In\n particular, thirteen countries have now banned the keeping of primates as pets (\nAustria, Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, France, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Norway).\n \nThe United Kingdom now has an opportunity to keep up with \nthis\n progress being made for the protection of wild animals \nacross Europe b\ny banning the keeping of primates as pets.\n1.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFurthermore, it is important to separate out those animals being kept as pets and those that are held under private ownership but for reasons of rescue or sanctuary. Many of our partners, in the UK and across Euro\npe, care for primates in their facilities. All of them have been rescued or confiscated, none of have been bought or bred on-site. However, many of these facilities are also not open to the public. Should a ban be implemented on the keeping of primates as \npets care should be taken to ensure definitions cater for these instances – or that exemptions be made.\n \nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
