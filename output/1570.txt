[[[Questions R]]]

[[[aised by the Committee]]]  &#xa0;In relation to buses in England, this is left to the market to determine, with local authorities having powers to support non commercial services or to support community transport where they contribute to solving local transport problems, including social isolation.  In relation to local rail services, the level of service is determined by the Department for Transport which specifies the franchise requirement.  Local authorities are able to support additional local train services but are frequently constrained from doing so by the reduction in rate support grant by central government and the inadequate remit on the provision of local rail services described above.&#xa0;&#xa0;The railway has responded well in recent years to the needs of different groups of passengers, and this brings benefits to those in isolated communities as well as those in more populous areas.  For example, all new trains are built to meet the requirements of the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations, 1998.  Even those that are not yet fully compliant are generally accessible and the increasing number of holders of Disabled Persons Railcards is evidence of the success of the policy of steadily improving accessibility over a period of 30 years.  Accessibility at some stations serving isolated communities is being improved through use of the ‘Harrington hump’ (see above.)Young people and older passengers benefit from the various railcards available which offer discounted fares.  On a number of routes serving isolated communities, the benefits are extended to all passengers who hold the local line railcard.  Most of these cards have been introduced as a result of the initiative of the CRP.  A few examples are:&#xa0;C. What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome?One challenge on a few rail routes is to be able to offer a frequency of service adequate to meet the various needs of people in the communities it serves.  A few rural railway routes offer a service of just four trains a day each way, which limits journey opportunities.  The lines concerned are:In the case of Esk Valley, for example, the timetable is built around the need to bring schoolchildren to Whitby from the villages along the Esk Valley, and to bring in day trip visitors to Whitby on Sundays.  (The permanent Sunday service results from the initiative of the CRP).  It cannot meet other demands, such as travel to work from Whitby to Middlesbrough, for example, or for longer day trips from the line to Leeds or London.  These limited services were introduced by BR many years ago as part of a resource-led timetable to save money, but have become embedded in the franchise specifications.  They severely limit the journey opportunities possible by rail and a great deal more could be achieved with a higher frequency.  As the lines serve isolated communities, demand levels will always be lower than those on the busier suburban or interurban routes which will therefore always show better value for money in any competition for resources.  However, as these lines are few in number and atypical, AcoRP would argue that funding and rolling stock should be made available, exceptionally, to improve services to the rural communities they serve, at least on a trial basis.  A number of long rural routes serving isolated communities in Scotland also have just three or four trains a day, but a positive example of tackling this is currently planned on the West Highland line between Glasgow and Oban.  Here, through skillful timetabling and diagramming of the Scotrail fleet, it will be possible to double the frequency between the junction at Crianlarich and Oban from three to six trains a day by using just one additional two-car train.  The additional cost of this is being met by Transport Scotland, but the benefits to passengers are widespread, providing new journey opportunities, better ferry connections to the islands and a link with the Fort William to London sleeper.     &#xa0;D. How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?Because of its flexibility and frequent use of accessible vehicles, Community Transport organisations can provide services that are tailored very specifically to local needs, offering a cost-effective transport option in rural areas.  Furthermore, their not-for-profit status and close links with the communities they serve meet the government’s localism agenda admirably.  However, as with CRP’s, reductions in local authority funding and other sources of income, such as BSOG, are putting the long-term future of many of these groups in doubt.  There is no doubt that closer integration of community transport operations with community rail routes could be of significant benefit to rural communities and could offer greater value for money across the board.  Several Community Rail Partnerships are already experimenting with minibus links to and from their local stations and these are proving successful. Similarly, the Heart of Wales Line partnership runs minibuses to bring people from the train to visit tourist attractions in the isolated communities along its route.  It is our view however that wider introduction of this concept could only be achieved with proper financial support and encouragement through modifying competition legislation.ACoRP fully supports community transport operations, and maintains contact with the Community Transport Association, although they are not directly within our remit. E. To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?Rail is a high volume transport mode and even the smallest train of one coach has a seating capacity for 75 passengers, so inevitably, some isolated communities will be better served by demand responsive transport services, including cars and bicycles.  The important point then is to ensure an easy transfer at the railhead with adequate car parking, secure cycle storage and good interchange between bus, taxi, community transport and rail.In general, deep rural areas have few taxis available and fares will inevitably be high, simply because of the distances to be covered.  Accessibility and the cost of living in rural areas remains a deep-seated problem, and the cost of a taxi fare will frequently outweigh the ability of someone to pay. In an urban environment, the taxi can be an affordable option, whereas for rural dwellers it becomes more often a distressed purchase.&#xa0;F. What are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can these services be made more affordable?With its own infrastructure and high safety and accessibility standards, rail is a relatively expensive mode, although costs are being reduced through the regulated settlement for Control Period 4 involving a reduction in Network Rail costs of around a third.  At the same time, reducing franchising payments or increasing premia for train operators mean that train operators in aggregate are now net contributors to Government, rather than a net cost to the taxpayer.  The principles of community rail development have enabled costs savings to be made (for example the Harrington hump) but community rail lines are generally run with minimal resources and the scope for significant further reduction of cost is limited.  However, CRPs are very effective in increasing ridership which reduces the subsidy per passenger kilometre and so increases the value for money to the taxpayer of the service provided.The Heart of Wales Line Forum is actively investigating whether some form of local management of their long route can be used to enhance services at low cost. They aim to have a scheme in place in time for the implementation of the new Wales and Borders franchise in 2018. They have the active support of Welsh Government, ORR and ACoRP in this.&#xa0;&#xa0;
