[[[&#xa0;]]]JTI is happy for this response to be made public&#xa0;&#xa0;IntroductionWhy the number of arrests, prosecutions and convictions for tobacco smuggling have fallen over the past three yearsWhy Border Force failed to meet its operational targets for tobacco seizure in 2012–13(a)               Methods of smuggling tobacco into the UK are varied and variable, making detection and seizure a challenging process.(b)               Seizures outside of the UK have gone up and Sir Charles suggests that this should mean less illicit tobacco is making its way into the UK.  In this regard, we note that work undertaken by HMRC outside the UK through its network of Fiscal Crime Liaison Officers has prevented illicit tobacco products from reaching UK borders. Overall cigarette seizures, regardless of where they take place (e.g. inland, border and overseas), have remained consistently high at between 1.7 and 1.9 billion cigarettes per annum over the past five years.  There has also been an upward trend in the amount of HRT seized over the same period.(c)               Two UK Border Force initiatives failed to deliver as anticipated. Whether the current sanctions and penalties for tobacco smuggling are appropriateThe similarities and differences in patterns of tobacco smuggling in the UK and Ireland, how they affect each other, and the implications of the restrictions on National Crime Agency operations in Northern IrelandThe possible impact of the introduction of standardised packaging in Ireland on the quantity and availability of illegal tobacco in the UK(a)               Illicit trade is inherently difficult to measure (both in terms of existing levels, changes over time and the causes of those changes).(b)              Australia is the only country in the world which has plain packaging in place and it is too early to assess in a meaningful sense the impacts of plain packaging there.                 (c)               There is, as far as JTI is aware, no established/recognised research base on the actual impacts (in terms of illicit trade or otherwise) on a neighbouring state of another having such a measure in place. It is right therefore that this Committee has called for evidence in respect of "the possible impact" of the introduction of plain packaging in Ireland on the illicit trade in tobacco in the UK and JTI has provided below its best assessment of such impacts. Reduced costs burdens for illicit traders“[P]lain packaging is highly likely to aggravate the existing negative impacts of the already serious and socially damaging trade in illicit tobacco. Since illicit products are often more accessible to those underage and those from low income groups, plain pack laws risk undermining a key objective of plain packaging: to reduce smoking by these groups.”The pre-existing impact of Irish illicit trade on the UK“[Crime groups] have already recognised a porous land border, and that is a weakness that we in law enforcement have to eradicate. We have a huge challenge on the island of Ireland as a whole, particularly around organised crime and serious harm, be it drugs or human trafficking in all its guises.”“… once you have established a route that you are confident you can use, in essence it does not much matter what the commodity is. Whether it is people, firearms, cigarettes or fuel, if the route is secure, then anything can be smuggled.” Anticipated impact on the quantity and availability of illegal tobacco in the UK

[[[New smuggling opportunities for criminals]]]“In December 2009, the Irish Minister of Finance announced that the government: “decided not to make any changes to excise on tobacco in this Budget because [the Minister of Finance] believe[s] the high price is now giving rise to massive cigarette smuggling”.”

[[[Increased consumer complicity]]]

[[[ ]]]The impacts of increased criminality in the UK “Children who buy cheap tobacco can come into contact with criminals. Some children are talked into selling cheap cigarettes on to school mates. People selling cheap tobacco are more likely to be selling other things illegally (DVDs, alcohol), exposing our children to more dangers.”   The relationship between tobacco smuggling, organised crime and paramilitary activityConclusion

[[[29 August 2013]]]&#xa0;&#xa0; Given the limitation on the length of submissions to the Inquiry, JTI have sought only to address the specific questions raised by the Committee.  JTI notes, however, that there are diverging views about the current illicit trade in tobacco products and how plain packaging risks exacerbating it, as reflected by criticism of JTI's related 2012 media campaign by certain tobacco control groups which were, in part, upheld by the ASA.  JTI disagrees with the ASA's conclusions and remains of the view that these adverts provide an important contribution to the political debate. Based on Empty Pack Surveys (

[[[EPS]]]).  The EPS involves the physical collection of discarded empty cigarette packs. Upon collection, samples are either sent to independent or manufacturer laboratories for analysis as to their authenticity. In 2012, around 25,000 packs were collected from 105 sample points across the UK. £34.66 billion for the years 2001/2 to 2010/11 based on HMRC’s upper estimates. The Taylor Report on Tobacco Smuggling was prepared by Martin Taylor for the then Chancellor, Gordon Brown. Separately, JTI have produced a number of documents that address the issue of illicit trade in more detail and we would be happy to provide the Committee with copies of these.  Such documents include our “Response to the Department of Health’s Consultation on the Standardised Packaging of Tobacco Products”, July 2012 (available at http://www.jti.com/files/4013/4149/4323/Packaging_Response.pdf), and “The Billion Pound Drop”, October 2012 (available at http://www.jti.com/files/2413/5220/4070/The_Billion_Pound_Drop_website_version.pdf).  JTI has also commissioned expert evidence to assess the impacts of plain packaging on tobacco products: “The Impact of Plain Packaging on the Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products, June 2012” (available at http://www.jti.com/files/5113/4150/5828/Impact_on_illicit_trade.pdf) by Professors Peggy Chaudhry and Zimmerman (the

As noted in the Zimmerman Report “In general, attempting to measure the global value of illicitly traded products is inherently difficult, and there are no reliable global statistics.” Professors Chaudhry and Zimmerman conclude that: “Policy makers should be aware that plain packaging will, in our expert opinion, make the illicit trade in tobacco worse and these policy makers should therefore be exceptionally careful to ensure that such regulations do not inadvertently undermine anti-illicit trade programs and initiatives.”, pp. 10 and 3.

Ibid, see Q159. The Zimmerman Report, footnote 292.  Professors Zimmerman and Chaudhry go on to note (at paragraph 228) that “Due to the hike in excise duty over this period, the price of a pack of 20 cigarettes in Ireland reached the highest in the EU at €8.45 a pack in 2009, €2 more than the EU country with the second highest prices. As at the date of this report, the exchange rates and the increase in duty mean that the UK is the most expensive market in the EU”. “Northern Ireland has witnessed an unprecedented wave of international migration... In the process, Northern Ireland has moved from a position of net migration loss to one of annual population gain.” Northern Ireland Assembly Research and Information Service Research Paper, February 2012, Dr Raymond Russell “Migration in Northern Ireland: an update”, NIAR 10-12, http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/Documents/RaISe/Publications/2012/general/3112.pdf.  “According to the Republic of Ireland's Central Statistics Office (CSO) 42,000 Irish people left the country in 2011.
