defaultRevolution Consulting Limited 
default(
default“Revolution”
default)
default has operated exclusively in the arena of local government commissioning and procurement since 2006. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOur lead consultant has been 
defaultinvolved in the Children’s Homes sector since 2000, h
defaultaving gained experience as 
defaultManaging Director of the largest provider of Children’s Homes in England at the time. He also created a completely new specialist Children’s Homes business between 2007-2012.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn parallel with that experience of providing 
defaultChildren’s Homes 
defaultservices, Revolution Consulting has worked on a variety of projects, each involved in
default the commissioning of services for looked after children.
default&#xa0;
defaultSince 2006 Revolution has 
defaulttherefore gained
default experience through delivery of consultancy and support projects in the sector including:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultOur lead consultant in this area is a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants with a substantial range of commercia
defaultl experience in several sectors. It is the commercial and fi
defaultnancial aspects of procurement for looked after children that are the core of our work, with a particular focus on the interaction of the commercial aspects with the professional childcare and education.

defaultidefaultidefault. A summary of our perspectivedefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;default“A wider perspectivedefault.default”default&#xa0;
defaultThe abuse of 
defaulteven one 
defaultChildren’
defaults Home
default resident is shocking.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe need to set aside whether we are 
defaultfrom government, private sector or charity and work together to stringently understand how we can bring about improvements in the way we care for looked after children so as to do everything we can to avoid such instances.
default&#xa0;
defaultThose with insight into the way 
defaultthat the systems work within local authority and children’s homes, but who have not seen details of investigations into the cases in Rochdale and elsewhere can only think about how we ourselves have operated and how we might have prevented the abuse. We ca
defaultn only therefore begin to offer the inquiry the questions it may need to ask of the Department for Education to ensure that the most experienced minds have been applied to analyzing the fine detail of 
defaulthow the cases came about.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere would appear to be som
defaulte worthwhile regulation and systems enhancements being proposed that specifically target some areas where weaknesses may be present. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is our view however that a wider perspective is needed. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe current marketplace of children’s homes services has evo
defaultlved without strategic vision related to need at a national, regional, or even sometimes at a local level. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe relationships of purchasers and providers do not 
defaultcurrently 
defaultcreate an environment that attracts investment or innovation, and instead has co
defaultnsid
defaulterable financial pressures that add to tensions between parties who should be working together. 
defaultThe risk is therefore that such pressures (or just the perception that there may be such pressures) may impinge upon the paramount need to act promptly in the b
defaultest interests of the children placed.
default This is the case on both the part of the provider and of the purchaser.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe need a children’s homes system where the very staff in daily contact with the young person are empowered to keep that young person safe, come what may. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe need a system where the adults involved are skilled and professional enough to remove the pressu
defaultres of financial constraints and private vs. public sector tensions, so that the child receives a focused, responsive and excellent service at all times.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt’s about people not 
defaultjust about 
defaultprocess.
default  
default&#xa0;defaultiiidefault. Our responses to the specific questions raiseddefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaulta. Are the DfE’s proposed reforms to the regulation of residential children’s homes appropriate and sufficient?default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Department for Education’s work in the area of Children’s Homes is, as stated in the consultation documents themselves, a response to the 
defaultterrible cases of abuse in Rochdale.
default&#xa0;
defaultSince the investigations that followed those investigations there have been similar cases reported elsewhere in the country. Reports are shocking and demands for action are understandable.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, in such times of he
defaultightened focus it is important to maintain a measured and informed approach, as to react in wide ranging ways may cause unforeseen problems elsewhere.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are difficulties from the outset because some of the information about the instances of abuse is n
defaultot in the public domain. Rightly, some information is undoubtedly confidential to protect victims. However, the questions that come to mind based on 
defaultonly 
defaultwhat has been published in the public domain are:
default&#xa0;
defaultHow many of the abuse cases in Rochdale
default, and elsewhere, involved children placed in Children’s Homes? 
defaultIt would appear that there were some, but they were a small minority of cases? Let us be clinically factual wherever we can.
default&#xa0;
defaultIs sufficient attention being given to address the protection of t
defaulthe other cohorts involved? (e.g. Children not in care, children in foster care, children in residential special schools?).
default i.e. Is this not a wider set of issues than Children’s Homes? 
defaultWhere in the wider policies and practices of local authorities and pol
defaultice forces will the Children’s Homes specific proposals fit?
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the cases involving Children’s Homes, have serious case reviews or other investigations been performed to identify the issues that contributed to the abusers gaining continuing access to the 
defaultabused?
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is our experience that there are many safeguards that can prevent this type of abuse, including:
default&#xa0;
defaultAppropriateness of placement – matching needs to 
defaultthose of 
defaultother residents, 
defaultto the strengths of the 
defaultstaff group
default 
defaultat the specific home 
defaultand organizati
defaultonal strengths
default.
default Has a dispassionate review been carried out as to whether the children abused in Rochdale and elsewhere appropriately placed in those homes in the first place?
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are then factors that a good provider would have had in place:
default&#xa0;
defaultAppropria
defaultteness of location –
default 
defaultour experience as providers of services for the most vulnerable young people is to do some of the 
defaultmost 
defaultcommon sense things. Obvious amongst these is to open homes in more rural, out of town places. This reduces the risks associated wit
defaulth more urbanized areas, can act as a disincentive to absconding behavior, and allows close management of the most vulnerable. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAppropriateness of staff skills and procedures to distract and divert from absconding
default – good providers have skilled and experienced staff who use a range of interpersonal skills to try distract young people from attempting to abscond. Whilst Children’s Homes cannot lock young people into the home, a really good staff group, aware of the yo
defaultung person’s likely behavior, will have developed a number of strategies to try to keep the young person otherwise engaged and occupied. 
default&#xa0;
defaultEven where a young person does manage to leave the home, a good provider, aware of the risks, should have procedures 
defaultin place respond immediately themselves. Whilst these are likely to include prompt notification to the local police
default (under protocols agreed locally well before the home becomes operational)
default, it can also include practical and immediate response from the sta
defaultff themselves. We have had experience of homes where 
defaultthe staff 
defaultha
defaults
default access to a “grab bag” containing mobile phone, waterproof clothing, snacks and drinks, which allows them to grab the bag and follow the absconding person immediately. The presence of a sta
defaultff member following an absconding young person can be a huge disincentive to those looking to harm a young person. 
default&#xa0;
defaultGood homes assiduously and promptly report and follow up absconding incidents
default. Social workers within the home and from the authority need t
defaulto urgently address the causes of the behavior and 
defaultto 
defaultagree interim action plans to try to manage future risk.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn cases where the assessment is of continuing risk of the behavior, and risk management is not sufficiently possible, then commercial drivers mu
defaultst be set aside in favour of a removal of the child to another, safer location and placement. Good providers must always put the young person’s interests ahead of commercial implications. We have experience of the placing authority not being responsive eno
defaultugh in such a situation and as a provider having to proactively serve notice to end placements where we felt unable to keep the young person safe.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are similarly practice issues on the placing authority side to be examined:
default&#xa0;
defaultDid the homes involved in
default Rochdale et al, proactively call on social worker and IRO for reviews if absconding was an issue?
defaultHow responsive and proactive were the professionals from the local authority in dealing with the cases?
default&#xa0;
defaultHow well were the authority monitoring the placement
default?
default&#xa0;
defaultHow well were the placing authorities monitoring the home and organisation under their placement contract?
default&#xa0;
defaultHow well were Ofsted monitoring the home?
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat we don’t know about these cases is where any of these protections failed. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCan the DfE
default assure us of a clear linkage in their suggestions and proposals to the specific areas of weaknesses? 
default&#xa0;
defaultAre any of the proposals in danger of being the momentum of the focus and getting too far ahead of the actual problems?
default&#xa0;
defaultIs there a danger of “Sledgeham
defaultmer to crack a nut”?
default&#xa0;
defaultAre the problems in fact rooted in with wider practices of 
defaultthe social care system, in operational failings of social work and procurement practices in some authorities?
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is assumption in the consultation that the fact that some of the young people involved were placed away from their “home” authority is a substantial issue. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe out of authority issue has been a theme for over a decade, and whilst it 
defaultmay
default be related 
defaultto the cases in Rochdale was it the major causal factor?
default&#xa0;
defaultHow many out of authority placements are inappropriate?
default&#xa0;
defaultThese questions need testing with an expert panel of social work professionals who have accumulated experience of the cohorts and of children
default’s homes placements. Let’s apply our best knowledge to properly analyse the situation at a detailed case by case level.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis leads
default us to 
defaultwhat we believe are possibly some of the most important
default underlying issues – failures in commissioning and procurement 
defaultand monitoring practice
default. We have recently responded to another inquiry into Local Government Procurement in some detail, focusing specifically of the failings of commissioning in the children’s services arena (copies of our response are 
defaultavailable
default upon requ
defaultest).
default&#xa0;
defaultThese 
defaultfailures 
defaultare harder to address as they involve performance of the whole care and education systems, but avoiding issues in the future may be better served by efforts here as well.
default&#xa0;
defaultA key theme of that response is that the solutions have to be 
defaultpeople, not process focused. It is of course more difficult to prescribe what is meant by that, but a healthier partnership between purchasers and providers of children’s homes is required to properly protect the very young people both are supposed to be s
defaulterving.
default&#xa0;
defaultWith so much Children’s Homes provision now in the private sector there are issues needing to be addressed about the interface of public and private sectors in areas such as services for vulnerable people. A higher standard of cross-sector underst
defaultanding and working is required to set clear boundaries between commercial pressures and delivery of services to meet needs.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis area requires more 
defaultdebate and development than this response has the capacity for, but we remain committed to contributing our
default expertise to that work.
defaultAredefault the reforms are likely to prove effective or further measures are neededdefault?default&#xa0;
defaultSome of the proposals and efforts may be worthwhile, and certainly many should be implemented if there is a chance they will improve things.
default&#xa0;
defaultBut ultimately it’s a real time issue. The manager and staff at a children’s home need to be empowered to identify arising absconding and abuse issues, to deal with them in real time, to divert, to distract, to follow 
defaultthe young person where possible, 
defaultand t
defaulto involve police where there are suspicions, and ultimately if all of those fail then to insist on the local authority acting immediately to remove a child 
defaultto a safer place 
defaultelsewhere.
default&#xa0;
defaultReal life and circumstances are more volatile and changeable than risk 
defaultassessments and monthly inspections and historical reporting can deal with.
defaultIt’s not therefore always about changes in 
defaultregulation
default and guidance, it’s about making sure the people dealing with the children day in day out are empowered and motivated to look a
defaultfter those children to the best of their abilities at all times, and that they are challenged to do so by outstanding homes and organisation
defaults
default working in close partnership with 
defaultplacing
default authorities and with police. 
default&#xa0;
defaultExcellence in commissioning, procurement 
defaultand monitoring allied to clear, informed national,
default r
defaultegional and local strategies are the bedrock of creating long term sustainable and excellent children’s homes of the type most likely to be needed as close to where they are needed as possible given the o
defaultverall population volatility.
default This is the environment which would be most likely to minimize the risks of Rochdale style abuse of a Children’s Homes resident in future. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs mentioned earlier, we believe that developments are needed to significantly refine
default the interface between public sector purchasers and private sector providers where the services are for vulnerable children and young adults. Detailed work is needed in areas such as:
