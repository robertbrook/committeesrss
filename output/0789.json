"Written evidence from Baxter Healthcare (LTC 41)Baxter Healthcare welcomes the opportunity to respond to The Health Committee’s \nexamin\nation of\n the way in which the NHS and social care system in England supports people with long-term conditions\n.\nBaxter is a worldwide, \nd\niversified \nh\nealthcare \nc\nompany that is known for applying innovative science and technology to develop \nspecialty\n therapeutics, medical products and services that save and sustain patients’ lives.\n \nOur core purpose is to improve the quality of life of patients with rare and chronic diseases. From hospital to home, we strive to deliver better and more affordable healthcare for people worldwide. \nThe committee has asked following questions and our responses are below.\nThe scope for varying the current mix of service responsibilities so that more people are treated outside hospital and the consequences of such service re-design for costs and effectivenessThere is huge scope for \nenabling more\n people with\n long term conditions \nto be treated \noutside of the hospital environment.\n \nDespite a wealth of evidence to support both clinical and cost effectivene\nss of home based therapies, \nuptake\n for many diseases\n is poor \nand is in fact declining in certain\n parts of the UK.\n \nIn particular, the use of Peritoneal Dialysis\n (PD)\n \nand home Haemodialysis \nfor the treatment of \nchronic kidney fa\nilure is at an all time low, despite a plethora of guidelines, evidence and quality standards supporting its use\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nIn addition to the treatment of chronic kidney failure, there are many other conditions that lend themselves to home or self-care treatment.\n \nThese include \nparentral\n nutrition for patients who have intestinal failure, outpatient \nparenteral\n anti-microbial therapy (OPAT) and immunoglobulin therapies (IG) for people suffering from immunological disorders.\n&#xa0;\nOne of the reasons for the decline in the uptake of home dialysis is thought to be the overestimation of the need to increase in-centre haemodialysis capacity\n which has resulted in a proliferation of centre based dialysis facilities throughout the UK.\n \nOnce a centre has been commissioned, it is incumbent upon clinicians and managers to keep the facility working at capacity to ensure cost effectiveness.\n \nHowever, decommissioning of such services and re-allocating staff to support home dialysis patients would greatly improve the ability for more people to be treated at home.\n&#xa0;\nAs well as the many quality of life benefits\n and improved outcomes\n that patients report by being on a home \nbased treatment it\n also generates cost savings\n.\n \nWith the current focus by the NHS on\n QIPP\n, to improve patient outcomes and generate cost savings these forms of treatment need to be fast tracked and implemented on a more substantial scale so that the full benefits can be realised by patients and the NHS alike.\n&#xa0;\nAnother strategy that \nwill\n aid the uptake of self care or home treatments is patient education, trai\nning and empowerment.\n \nRaising awareness of the availability and success of home based therapies amongst patients and the public can promote their use. This requires the commitment of all those involved in the design and delivery of services\n, including the physicians and nurses who discuss treatment options with their patients\n. High quality\n \ntraining and education of patients and their families before comme\nncing and during their time on\n home based treatments will also\n improve patients’ adherence to treatment regimes\n and thus promote clinical and cost effectiveness of treatments.\n&#xa0;\nThe readiness of local NHS and social care services to treat patients with long-term conditions (including multiple conditions) within the communityUptake of home or community based treatments varies considerably across the UK.\n \nOur experience shows that in areas where there is a belief and culture in home therapies from b\noth clinicians\n and \ncommissioners, uptake is higher.\n \nIn areas where there is a lower level of belief, barriers from social care services tend to become more difficult to overcome.\nThe IT infrastructure that can support the treatment of patients in the community is still weak.\n \nAnecdotally, there is resistance to the uptake of remote monitoring systems due to potential liability issues on the part of the clinician.\n \nIf the\n appropriate IT capabilities \nwere available \nto enable clinicians to have remote oversight of the patients’ clinical condition\n,\n \nreassurance (that the patient can be managed as well outside the acute setting as within hospital) could be \nprovide\nd\n to all parties.\nThe practical assistance offered to commissioners to support the design of services which promote community-based care and provide for the integration of health and social care in the management of long-term conditionsTo our knowledge there is very little available \nfor \ncommissioners to promote \nor support the design of services for \nhome based therapie\ns or to further integrate health and social care services.\n \nWe believe that should such support be made available,\n the uptak\ne of home treatments for long term conditi\nons could see an increase.\n \nT\nhe recent changes to the NHS\n in England\n, and in \nparticular the commissioning of specialist services, has led to a relatively small number of commissioners being given responsibility for a much wider scope of specialist services.\n \nTheir task of being fully informed on all available treatment\n options \nfor the full range of diseases within their remit is therefore made even more erroneous. \nMany of these rare diseases f\nrequently co-\nexist with a range of other long term conditions and patients would benefit enormously from self care and home care\n being offered.\n \nThe recent production of specialist commissioning service specifications should help with this, however the quality of these is variable and work needs to be done to ensure that they are consistent in approach.\nThe development of \nCQuINS\n should also help commissions to drive innovation and develop services for patients at home.\n \nHowever uptake of specific home therapy based \nCQuINs\n varies and is not yet mandatory.\n \nIt is essential that commissioners become fully engaged with Health and Wellbeing Boards to ensure a full understanding of the social care barriers that need to be addressed.\nThe ability of NHS and social care providers to treat multi-morbidities and the patient as a person rather than focusing on individual conditionsBaxter is not in a position to comment on this question however we would encourage the development of a simple mechanism for regular feedback from patients groups, individual patients and others to monitor this closely.\nObesity as a contributory factor to conditions including diabetes, heart failure and coronary heart disease and how it might be addressedBaxter is not in a position to comment on this question.\nCurrent examples of effective integration of services across health, social care and other services which treat and manage long-term conditionsBaxter has a number of examples of good practice with effective integration of services to treat and manage long-term conditions.\n \nThe concept of shared fields of practice, of which home dialysis is one \nexample, requires collaboration and equity among health care professionals to ensure that the impact of change is for the benefit of the patient. \nAutomated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD) is a home-based therapy usually carried out by patients themselves.\n \nTraining takes place in a renal unit or specialist training centre in all aspects of care.\n \nThe parent unit regularly follows up patients either in clinic or in the community.\n \nHowever, many patients with end-stage renal disease are unable to undertake peritoneal dialysis (PD) on their own, yet would prefer treatment in their own homes.\n \nIn particular, the majority of elderly patients are on the hospital based treatment, haemodialysis (HD) despite the problems and costs of transport, achieving vascular access and, often, poor tolerance of the HD process. \nTo address this problem, assisted PD using community \nHealthcare Assistants h\nas been developed.\n \nHealthcare assistants visit the patient’s home once a day to check the previous day’s treatment, check the patient’s wellbeing and set up the dialysis for the next treatment.\n \nThe healthcare assistant is trained to observe for a range of sign and symptoms and to call the patient’s parent renal unit should they have concerns.\nThis system has been operating in the UK for almost six years and seen great success.\n \nOver 250 patients are currently using the service which represents almost 10% of the PD population, all of whom would not be able to have a home based treatment if the service was not available.\n \nThe system required collaboration and team work between the NHS renal unit, the home care provider and the nursing support organisation to enable seamless high quality care.\nThe implications of an ageing population for the prevalence and type of long term conditions, together with evidence about the extent to which existing services will have the capacity to meet future demandThe implications of an ever increasing elderly population will inevitably impact on the prevalence and type of long term conditions experienced.\n \nIn many long term disease areas, as treatments improve, patients live for longer and thus are susceptible to a greater number of co-morbidities.\n \nFor example people with the bleeding di\nsorder haemophilia, would\n have an average survival of\n 15 years if born in 1960, whereas today they have a normal life expectancy as techniques such as prophylaxis are now used to better manage their condition.\n \nIn addition, treatments for long term diseases are now offered to older patients than previously.\n \nThus, more patients are being treated for more diseases with more treatments than before.\nCapacity planning\n therefore\n needs to be much more holistic\n than in the past\n, and \nconsider all available locations for care.\n \nI\nntegrat\nion between primary, secondary, community and social care needs to be factored into capacity planning and the use of ho\nme care\n considered for a greater proportion of patients\n.\n \nRemote\n monitoring systems \nand electronic health records should be\n considered as \nintegral to the support of patients and these must be accessible to patients as well as clinicians in both primary and secondary care\n.\nCurrently there are many \nperverse \nfinancial \nincentives\n that exist\n,\n \npreventing the uptake of home treatments.\n \nFrequently \nthe acute hospital\n is financially penalised for moving care out of the hospital setting, despite home treatments being clinically effective and more cost effective and than in-centre alternatives. One example of this is the use of outpatient anti-microbial therapy (OPAT) for the treatment of \nmulti-resistant TB.\nThe interaction between mental health conditions and long-term physical health conditionsBaxter is not in a position to comment on this question.\nThe extent to which patients are being offered personalised services (including evidence of their contribution to better outcomes)Baxter is not in a position to comment on this question however we would encourage the development of a simple mechanism for regular feedback from patients groups, individual patients \nand others to monitor this closely.\n \nThe regular use of patient reported outcome and experience measures should become routine practice.\nMay 2013\n NICE CKD Quality Standards (QS5) March 2011\n NICE PD Clinical Guidelines (CG125) July 2011\n NICE Costing Report – Implementing NICE Guidance 125 July 2011\n A Home Dialysis Manifesto.\n \nA report of the findings of the 2013 Home Dialysis Summit.
