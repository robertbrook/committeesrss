[[[Brief introduction and reason for submitting evidence]]]1.1              This submission has been prepared by Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife               Trust on behalf of The New Forest Non-Native Plants Project. &#xa0;1.2              Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust is a registered charity (number               201081) and a Company limited by guarantee and registered in England               (number 676313). &#xa0;1.3              The New Forest Non-Native Plants Project commenced in 2009 to stop the               spread of invasive non-native plants in the New Forest area, particularly along               rivers and in wetland habitats. It is hosted by Hampshire and Isle of Wight               Wildlife Trust and is supported by a partnership of organisations including the               Forestry Commission, Environment Agency, Natural England and the New               Forest National Park Authority. &#xa0;1.4              Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust welcomes the opportunity to submit               written evidence to the Inquiry. The New Forest Non-Native Plants Project               contributes to the implementation of The Invasive Non-Native Species               Framework               Strategy for Great Britain (DEFRA, 2008) through a) control and               eradication of invasive non-native plants, b) building awareness and                             understanding of the problems caused by invasive non-native species and c)               commissioning research into the impact of invasive non-native plants and               novel methods of control. As recognised by the Framework Strategy,                             successful implementation relies on a ‘strong partnership approach’ with               landowners; the New Forest Non-Native Plants Project has established strong               links with landowners but progress towards eradication of invasive non-native               plants at the catchment scale is being hampered by the inability to ascertain               the ownership of certain areas of land. &#xa0;1.5              Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust wishes to draw the Inquiry’s               attention to the Law Commission’s review of Wildlife Law, in particular the               proposal to introduce powers to make species control orders. We consider               that the introduction of species control orders, in particular in situations where               the name and address of the land owner can not be ascertained, would be of               significant benefit to the control and eradication of invasive non-native               species.

[[[Evidence submitted by Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust]]]2.1              We note that the Inquiry will examine ‘the case for any change in the law               regarding invasive species’ and ‘any lessons for England and Wales from the               experience of Scotland’s invasive species legislation and controls’. &#xa0;2.2              Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust considers that changes in               legislation are required to enable invasive non-native species to be               successfully controlled and eradicated at the catchment scale. &#xa0;2.3              It is an offence under Section 14(2) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 to               ‘plant or otherwise cause to grow in the wild’ any plant listed in Part II of               Schedule 9 of this Act. Although Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust               recognises that responsibility therefore rests with riparian landowners to stop               the spread of plants listed in Schedule 9, we consider that landowners need               advice, encouragement and practical help to enable invasive non-native plants               to be successfully eradicated at the catchment scale.  The New Forest Non-              Native Plants Project was therefore set up to liaise with landowners and offer               advice and practical help to control relevant invasive non-native species along               river valleys and in wetland habitats in the New Forest area.&#xa0;2.4              Since the start of The New Forest Non-Native Plants Project in 2009, the               Project Officer has identified riparian owners along relevant watercourses to               offer advice and help with the control of invasive non-native species, for               example giant hogweed and Himalayan balsam. The vast majority of               landowners have co-operated with the Project Officer, recognised the need               for the control of invasive non-native species on their land and have               understood the importance of a ‘joined-up’ approach with neighbouring               landowners to tackle the spread of invasive non-native plants at the catchment               scale. &#xa0;2.5              However, in a minority of cases, the Project Officer has been unable to identify               the owner(s) of the land, despite extensive research. The inability to identify               the current landowner of even a single parcel of land presents a challenge to               successful eradication at the catchment scale, as seed from plants growing on               this land can fall into the adjacent watercourse and be carried downstream to               re-infest areas where landowners, contractors and volunteers have worked               hard to control the invasive species. &#xa0;2.6              During 2012 the Law Commission undertook a consultation exercise in               relation to its review of wildlife law. Chapter 8 of the consultation document               (Law Commission Consultation Paper No 206) considered the control of               invasive non-native species and included Provisional Proposal 8-7 for ‘the               power to make species control orders on the same model as under the Wildlife               and Natural Environment (Scotland) Act 2011’.&#xa0;2.7              Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust fully supported this Provisional               Proposal in our response to the Law Commission dated 8 November 2012.               We welcomed the proposal for species control orders to require a person to               destroy invasive non-native species on their property. We welcomed the               introduction of species control orders which can permit a person to enter land               without the need for permission from the owner or occupier (normally with 14               days notice) to carry out operations required by the order. We welcomed the               proposal for emergency species control orders which would permit a person to               enter land to undertake work without the need to give the owner or occupier               14 days notice. &#xa0;2.8              In our response to the Law Commission’s consultation, we pointed out that               one of the major problems currently facing the New Forest Non-Native Plants               Project is how to deal with invasive non-native species on land where the               owner can not be traced. We cited the example of the Cadnam River where               we are helping landowners to eradicate the Schedule 9 plant called Himalayan               balsam but where the owner of one parcel of land can not be identified,               despite extensive research involving inter alia Land Registry searches,               interviews with neighbouring landowners, correspondence with the son of a               previous owner, correspondence with the Highways Agency who once owned               the land and discussions with local residents. We have therefore been unable               to tackle the Himalayan balsam on this parcel of land and are acutely               conscious that all the effort/time/resources being expended further               downstream is being jeopardised by the seeds being shed from plants growing               on this particular parcel of land. &#xa0;2.9               We were therefore very encouraged to note that (in paragraph 8.76 of the Law               Commission Consultation Paper No 206) ‘a species control order can be               made by statutory notice if the relevant body is unable to ascertain the name               and address of any owner or occupier’. We would strongly welcome the               introduction of species control orders which can be imposed on land where the               ownership can not be ascertained.

[[[Recommendations for action]]]3.1              Following the Law Commission’s consultation exercise during 2012 (Law               Commission Consultation Paper No 206), a Wildlife Law Interim Statement (15               October 2013) has been published which sets out the Law Commission’s               conclusions in advance of it drafting legislation. The Interim Statement               recommends (paragraph 1.83) the introduction of species control orders in               England and Wales. /Con3.2              Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust asks the Environmental Audit               Committee to consider endorsing the Law Commission’s recommendation for               the introduction of species control orders in England and Wales. The               introduction of species control orders would allow entry onto land in order to               control an invasive non-native species and would be of particular benefit               where the relevant body is unable to ascertain the name and address of any               owner or occupier.&#xa0;3.3              We consider the introduction of species control orders would significantly               contribute to the successful control and eradication of invasive non-native               plants at the catchment scale, thereby furthering the implementation of the               Invasive Non-Native Species Framework Strategy for Great Britain.&#xa0;7 January 2014&#xa0;&#xa0;
