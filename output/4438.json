"&#xa0;\nDisabled people’s \nvoice\n, participation\n and \nempowerment \n1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is a growing recognition of the need for approaches to development which are \nmore inclusive of disability issues and disabled\n people\n (DP)\n, as reflected \nby\n the Post-2015 ‘Leave no one behind’ agenda, and\n by\n this Parliamentary Inquiry. \nThis submission does not seek to repeat the arguments for disability inclusion, but instead\n \nfocuses on the importance of voice, participation and e\nmpowerment in achieving development processes which are more inclusive of \nDP\n. \n&#xa0;\n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe right to participation is explicit in international law through several conventions, including the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD). \nPartic\nipation/voice are\n also a key strateg\nies\n for making development efforts \nmore effective in reaching the poorest and\n most marginalised in societies, and they depend on and feed in to empowerment processes. \n&#xa0;\n1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDFID \nhas actively supported the voice and participa\ntion of \nDP\n in the post-2015 process. This approach now needs to be scaled up and institutionalised within DFID at all levels, both to strengthen disability inclusion in DFID’s work, as well as to influence other development actors and \nprocesses\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe therefore urge DFID to ensure that the voice, participation and empowerment of \nDP\n is promoted systematically across all its programmes and partnerships through:\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAccountability and funding mechanisms which include a requirement to engage with \nDP\n in all c\nonsultation, participation and accountability processes.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProviding country programmes and implementation partners with the support and resources needed to become effecting in engaging with \nDP.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFunding and other support to initiatives/channels for the voice\n, participation and empowerment of \nDP\n, such as DPOs. \n2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince 1985 \nADD International \nhas worked with \nDP\n’s Organisations (DPOs) in Africa and Asia\n, from grassroots to national level, \nto strengthen their capacity to bring improvements to the \nlives of their members, and to advocate for the inclusion of \nDP\n in all aspects of political, social and economic life. Drawing on this direct experience we work as an ally to the disability movement in influencing development policy and practice\n at all lev\nels t\no become more inclusive of \nDP\n and disability issues.  \n&#xa0;\n3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDP’s participation in development is a right: The \nUN Convention on the Rights of \nPersons with Disabilities\n \n(UNCRPD) is clear on the \nright of \nDP\n to full and effective participation and inclusion in society (Article 3 – General Principles), their right to participate \nin public affairs, including the work of \nNGO’s, and the obligation of s\ntates to \nencourage \nDP\n to participate and to promote an environment where they can do this ‘\nwithout discrimination and on an equal basis with others’\n (Article 29)\n. \nThe obligation of the UK government to adhere to these principles in all aspects of internati\nonal cooperation is also clear (Articles 11 and 32).\n&#xa0;\n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDevelopment processes are more effective when they are based on the lived experience of DP: The past 2 decades has seen a shift in understanding of disability from a ‘medical model’ to ‘rights based’ approaches which focus on the social and environmental barriers \nthat\n exclude \nDP\n. \nB\ny listening to the voices of \nDP\n themselves (through their active e\nngagement at all stages of the development process; analysis, policy development, planning, implementation, evaluation), decision\n \nmakers can gain an understanding of the barriers and social dynamics which contribute to their exclusion and limit their oppor\ntunities. Based on these insights it is possible to develop interventions which\n \ntarget the cause\ns – rather than just the symptoms -\n of \nDP\n’s exclusion. \n&#xa0;\n3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEmpowerment is a precondition for effective participation… and greater participation leads to empowerment: The disempowerment which \nDP\n \nexperience \nas a result of social exclusion\n and discrimination leads to isolation, low levels of education and skills, and low self-esteem. \nThrough interventions which support their\n individual and collective\n engagement \nin economic, social and political life, \nDP\n \nincrease their confidence and their status within their communities. This creates the conditions where \nDP\n can become agents of change \nin their own lives as well as in the lives of others\n by \ncoming together (throug\nh DPOs and other CSOs) to \nadvocat\ne\n for sustainable social and structural change\n, holding duty-bearers to account in\n delivering \non their commitments on the righ\nts of all \nDP\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIncreased engagement between disabled and non-DP challenges the assumptions and negative attitudes which lie behind discrimination and exclusion: When \nDP\n \nbecome active \nparticipa\nnts\n in \neconomic, social, cultural and political life, \nthey become more visible \nin society \nand engage\n more\n with non-\nDP\n. \nADD International\n’s experience\n (examples below) shows how th\nis process of engagement is a critical element in tackling \ndiscrimination, changing attitudes, and removing barriers to inclusion\n \nin all aspects of life. \n&#xa0;\n4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDP’s Organisations (DPOs) - \nrepresentative\n organisations ‘of’ \nDP\n – and\n \nnational disability movements \nare\n a\n key channel for the individual and collective empowerment of \nDP\n by \npromoting the\nir\n voice and active participation in all areas of life -  social, economic, political and cultural. They do this\n \nby\n: Bringing individuals out of isolation through mutual support; Building a common identity and status \nfor \nDP\n; Providing opportunities for \nDP\n’s personal and economic empowerment; Advocating for access to services and other development support; Raising aw\nareness of \nand challenging \ndisability discrimination\n, \nnegative attitudes and stigma\n. \n \nActing through the d\nisability movement\n, \nDP\n were at the heart of the process which led to the adoption \nof the UNCRPD in 2006, \nand \nhave \nalso \nbeen \nkey actors \nin getting \nstates to ratify\n, and in influencing the development of the legislation needed for states to meet their commitments under the convention. \n&#xa0;4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStrengthening organisational capacity is a critical element in ensuring that DPOs become effective in promoting the \nvoice\n,\n participation\n and empowerment\n of \nDP\n in all aspects of life, and in development processes. \nOver 28 years’ working with DPOs, we have learnt that t\nhe high levels of exclusion and disadvantage experienced by \nDP\n, including exclusion from education, ofte\nn means that the capacity building needs of DPOs are greater than those of other CSOs, and it can take longer to achieve sustainable progress. Practical challenges relating to mobility and communication are also factors which may mean that more time and re\nsources need to be invested in capacity building processes. \n&#xa0;\n4.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDP\n do not represent a homogenous group, and the challenges faced by individuals are also linked to other \nintersecting factors of exclusion and inequality such as gender, age, ethnicity etc. In p\nromoting the voice\n, \nparticipation \nand empowerment \nof \nDP\n it is important to analyse and address these factors and to take active steps to remove the additional barriers. Through an \naccompaniment approach to capacity building, ADD has worked with partner DPO\ns to build awareness and understanding of these issues within disability movement\ns\n, and to develop strategies to address them\n. With regard to gender, this has included the creation of women’s DPOs / women’s departments in DPOs, as well as quotas to improve\n the representation of disabled women within DPO \nexecutive boards and to encourage the emergence of disabled women as leaders. \n&#xa0;\n4.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nActive steps also need to be taken to reach impairment or identity groups which are\n highly excluded as a result of social norms and beliefs, and to facilitate their inclusion\n and engagement in development processes\n. In Uganda\n, for example,\n people living with/affected by a\nlbinism \nare subject to extreme discrimination and vulnerable to violence and abuse \nrelating to superstitious beliefs and practices. This results in extreme isolation, where women \nwho have children\n with albinism are often rejected by their husbands, and people living with albinism (PLWA) are often hidden away by their families from childh\nood through into adulthood. The Elgon Foundation for Persons with Albinism (EFPA)\n, established \nand run by PLWA\n,\n engages with communities, local government and civil society actors to increase recognition, awareness and protection of PLWA.\n An evaluation of \nthis project (2013) found that as a result of this initiative, more children living with albinism are enrolling in and staying in school; police vigilance in protecting the rights of PLWA has increased;\n \nmore PLWA are becoming members of other civil society\n \norganisations\n; local authorities are explicit in stating that services should include PLWA; and PLWA report they feel they are more respected within their communities.  A key aspect of this process has also been to work with DPOs so that PLWA are recognis\ned as \nDP\n and included within the wider disability movement: In the areas of EPFA’s work, PLWA now occupy leadership positions within district level DPOs. \n&#xa0;\n4.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nThe need \nfor systematic disaggregation of data by\n disability as well as gender and other factors is crucial, and is covered in more detail in other submissions (DDG \n/ \nInternational Centre for \nEvidence in\n Disability\n). However, data alone is not enough to build the understanding needed \nfor \neffective\n interv\nentions\n –\n \nalso essential\n are \nparticipatory initiatives which produce qualitative evidence by eliciting and capturing the\n perspectives of DP themselves. \nThe ‘Voices of the Marginalised’ participatory research project \n(\nADD International/\n HelpAge Internationa\nl\n/ Sightsavers/ \nAlzheimer’s Disease International) represented a channel through which \nDP\n, older people and people living with mental health issues could feed in to \nthe post-2015 policymaking process\n – and project \nparticipants also reported that they \nfound\n the process itself empowering.\n The resulting report, ‘We can also make change’\n(2013)\n, provides evidence of the issues and dynamics which contribute to the exclusion of older and \nDP\n and \nmakes \nrecommendations (relating to livelihoods security, access\n to public services, and ending bullying and violence) which are grounded in their direct experience and analysis.  \n&#xa0;\n4.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEngaging non-disabled stakeholders is an important element in participation and empowerment processes.\n In Cambodia ADD worked with DPOs to\n address the extreme marginalisation of people intellectual disabilities (PWID) in rural communities\n by building their capacity to participate in social and economic activities\n. \nA final evaluation found that the engagement of \nstakeholders at all levels of \nthe community, \nwith an initial emphasis on building understanding of intellectual disability, had been a key factor in achieving success. Furthermore, as PWID participated more in family and community activities, the community \nactively \nsought opportunities\n to secure their access to services (e.g. inclusion in free healthcare services) and \n mainstream \ndevelopment opportunities (\ne.g. income generation grants).\n&#xa0;\n4.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPositive discrimination approaches, including quotas, can \ncontribute to\n increasing \nDP\n’s participati\non in economic and political spheres.\n In U\nganda, where the parliamentary system makes provision for \n5 directly elected MPs\n representing DP (and who must be DP themselves), disability issues are prominent in policymaking and legislation (Uganda’s 2012 report to the UN Committee on UNCRPD). Drawing on Uganda’s experience, a similar approach is now being developed in Kenya.  \nApp\nroaches involving \nsetting and monitoring \nquotas\n can also have a positive impact\n in the private sector\n: \nIn Bangladesh,\n as a result of influencing work carried out by ADD and DPOs, the \nBangladesh \nG\narments \nM\nanufacturing and \nE\nxport \nA\nssociation BGMEA \nissued a l\netter to all its members asking them to recruit \nDP\n. \nDP\n who have received appropriate training (through their DPO) are now able to secure work in garments factories\n, while t\nhe recruitment of \nDP\n is also \nleading to changes which will support disability inclus\nion in the long-term such as adjustments \nto improve access, and \nimproved\n attitudes towards \nDP\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDespite leading the way on thinking on disability inclusion with its paper on\n \nDisability, Poverty and Development\n in 2000, and despite the UK government’s \nobligations under the UNCRPD and the UK Disabil\ni\nty Discrimination Act, \nDFID currently has \nno written policy commitments on disability inclusion. As a result\n there \nis no reporting \nrequirement \nor funding incentive \nfo\nr DFID programmes to ensure or to demonstrate that the promotion of \nDP\n’s voice and participation has been incorporated as a strategy to increase impact in all interventions.\n&#xa0;\n5.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDespite the existence of \nguidelines \nwhich emphasise\n the importance of \nDP\n’s voice and participation, \nknowledge and uptake of these across DFID’s programmes has been very limited.\n \nThe \n2007 \nHow to \nNote \non Working on Disability in Country Programmes\n, for example,\n \nrecommends action on involving DPOs in all civil society \nconsultations, and in 2010 all DFID country programmes were sent a Guidance Note \non how to improve educational access and quality for children with disabilities\n, which included recommendations on participatory approaches\n. A study conducted in 2012 by an NG\nO Informal Working Group on DFID and education for children with disabilities found that only half of the country offices surveyed had read the Guidance Note. \nHowever, the research also found that, although the country offices surveyed had not involved DPO\ns closely in the planning and monitoring of education programmes, they were open to doing this in the future, and would welcome support in putting this into practice. \n&#xa0;\n5.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPromotion of the voice, participation and empowerment of \nDP\n \nshould\n theoretically fall w\nithin the scope of \naction point 2.1. of DFID’s current Business Plan (Build open societies and institutions in our partner countries), and DFID’s \n \npledge to ensure 40 million people have more control over their own development and hold their governments to account. However, \nwithout clear obligation to \nensure that \nDP\n are included in these initiatives, and support to achieve this, they are easily negle\ncted: For example, a recent ICAI (Independent Commission for Aid Impact) evaluation of DFID’s empowerment \nand accountability programming in Ghana and Malawi ma\nkes\n no reference to \nDP\n at all\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDFID is currently \ninvesting in strengthening the disability movement as a channel for the voice, participation and empowerment of \nDP\n through \nfunding\n to ADD International\n (PPA),\n \nthe Disability Rights Fund and a small portfolio of \nNGO projects. However, these initiatives represent a very small proportion of overall D\nFID support to participation, empowerment and \naccountability initiatives. Furthermore, while strengthening DPOs represents an essential step in promoting \nDP\n’s empowerment and participation, it is also important to build opportunities for the voice of \nDP\n to\n be heard within other movements and fora\n, such as the women’s movement. \n&#xa0;\n5.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDespite the absence of a strategy or policy on disability inclusion, DFID and the UK government have played a\nn\n \nimportant role in ensuring that disability inclusion has been firmly on the agenda in the post-2015 process, as reflected in both the HLP and Secretary General’s reports. In carrying out this influential role, DFID was able to draw on the qualitative evidence based on the voice and experience of \nDP\n through participatory pro\njects such as the Voices Research Project (see above). \nDFID has also been very supportive of the principle of \nDP\n’s representatives participating in key fora within the post-2015 process, such as the HLP panels in Liberia and Bali, and has actively engaged \nwith the disability movement and with disability focused INGOs such as ADD International to make this happen. \n&#xa0;\n5.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe recognise \nthat \nthe \ncommitment and engagement of key individuals w\nithin DFID and the UK government has been\n an essential element\n in ensuring t\nhis focus on disability issues\n, and the inclusion of \nDP\n’s perspectives,\n in\n the post-MDG discussions\n. The same individuals are currently championing disability inclusion within DFID, through initiatives such as the commitment to ensure schools built with \nDFID funding are physically accessible, and the recent rejection of some business cases which ignore disability. However, without this commitment becoming institutionalised within a strategy and systems, these gains could be lost as individuals move on.\n&#xa0;\n6.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe support the BOND DDG’s call for DFID to \nmake a \nhigh level commitment to disability inclusion, supported by a TOC, strategy and systems for implementation and accountability which locate disability within the \nwider context of equity and i\nnclusion. \n&#xa0;\n6.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThese structures must \nemphasise the importance of promoting the voice, participation and empowerment of DP, making clear links with \nDFID’s \ncommitments and \ninitiatives on \naccountability, \nempowerment\n and governance\n. \n&#xa0;\n6.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFunding\n decisions\n for direct DFID programmes, bilateral funding, and work through partner organisations should be linked to \na requirement to include DP in all consultation, participation, empowerment and accountability processes, with \naccountability mechanism\ns in place to \nensure this happens\n, including the requirement for \ndata to be disaggregated in order to monitor the inclusion and participation of \nDP\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn order to \ncreate the conditions for DP’s individual and collective empowerment, and the channels through which their voices can be heard, DFID should fund – and\n encourage others to support - \ninitiatives which promote the emergence of the disability movement and other civil society structures through which \nDP\n participate and gain empowerment. In doing this, DFID should ensure \nthat specific measures are taken to ensure the equitable participation of those \nDP\n who are furthest from power as a result of other factors such as gender, age and location. \n&#xa0;\n6.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDFID should\n \ncontinue to champion and support the participation of DP in the post-2015 process, to ensure that the focus on disability inclusion achieved thus far is not lost in the final drafting of the post-2015 development framework. We call on DFID to use its infl\nuence to encourage other countries to engage with disability movements in country-level negotiations on post-2015 commitments, and where necessary, DFID should provide support to partner countries to do this. \n&#xa0;\n6.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDFID country offices \nshould \nengage directly with DP through their organisations, both to inform DFID’s understanding of disability and how better to include it in country programmes, and also to support \nDP\n’s empowerment through access to information and knowledge on development processes. \n&#xa0;\n6.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDFID should carry out and fund \nresearch and evaluations to inform good practice on engagement with \nDP\n, and to identify effective approaches to strengthening participation and empowerment. \n&#xa0;\n6.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nResources and advice \nmust be made \navailable within DFID \nin order \nt\no support programme staff\n in\n making \nreasonable accommodations which may be necessary for \nDP\n’s participation in consultation processes. DFID should strive to model good practice regarding the equitable participation of \nDP\n within its own teams, structures an\nd facilities. \n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nIn this submission we use the term ‘disabled people’ to reflect the terminology of the UK disability rights movement, but we recognise that in different contexts ‘people with disabilities’ \nis used, while the UNCRPD refe\nrs to ‘persons with disabilities’.\n"
