"Written evidence submitted by The Law Society (JRR 0029)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThis paper is divided into 3 sections.  First, we \nprovide \nan overview of our concerns regarding the \nGovernment’s proposed judicial review reforms\n, next we \nrespond to the specific list of issues \nreferred to \nin the Joint Committee on Human R\nights’ (JCHR) call for evidence\n.\n \nThirdly\n, we make some concluding comments.\n&#xa0;\n1.0\n              \nThe Law Society is concerned by the latest set of proposals from the Government for changes to judicial review.  The right of the ordinary citizen to challenge the decision of a public body is fundamental to the concepts of civil society and the rule of la\nw.  It is essential \nthat \nthere \nshould \nbe a\nn effective\n legal right of protection against arbitrary or unlawful decisions by public bodies.  Judicial review has been developed by the courts as the functions of the state have expanded into every aspect of peo\nple’s lives.  \n1.1\n              \nIt may be inconvenient and time consuming for the decisions of public authorities to be susceptible to legal challenge.  However, if the right to judicial review is reduced \nit is likely that \nin the long term \neveryone will suffer\n as\n \nd\necision makers \ncould \nbecome less accountable and more \ncareless\n in their actions.  The ordinary citizen will have less scope for seeking redress for wrongs which they may have suffered at the hands of public bodies.  \nAs a consequence p\nublic trust in authori\nty will in time be undermined.  \n1.2\n              \nCivi\nl\n society has to be founded on checks and balances.  At present\n,\n judicial review is the principal restraint on \nunlawful \nstate \naction \nin \nthe United Kingdom\n.  The erosion of the right to judicial review \nwould \nbe regre\ntt\nable\n.  The full consequences will take considerable time to emerge\n and \nas \na \nresult,\n no \nchanges should be adopted \nwithout significant consideration\n.\n1.3\n              \nThere are two key proposals in the Ministry of Justice consultation \nJudicial review – proposals for fu\nrther reform \nwhich will impact on recourse to judicial review.  Proposals to narrow the standing of applicants are likely to reduce legal challenges.  Proposals to limit legal aid payment to judicial review cases which receive permission to be heard\n,\n are l\nikely both to reduce the \nability \nof lawyers to undertake cases and \nalso \ndeter members of the public from applying for judicial review.\n1.4\n              \nThe proposals \nproceed from a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the judicial review remedy.  Although \nclaims may be brought only by a person with a “sufficient interest” in the matter at issue, it is wrong to equate judicial review claims to private law claims.  Judicial review is a means of correcting public law wrongs rather than simply asserting private\n law rights.  Indeed, the discretionary nature of the remedy – of which the Government no doubt approves – is as much a ref\nlection of the public interest nature of the jurisdiction as are the rules of standing and third party intervention which the Governm\nent seeks to curtail.  \n2.0\n              \nThis section responds to some of the issues and cases mentioned in the JCHR’s call for evidence\n. \n2.1\n              \nThe Law Society \nopposes \nthe case for a\nltering the test for judicial review.  \nThe Government maintains that too many cases are b\ne\ning brought by claimants with little or no direct interest in the matter.  \nThe Government\n’\ns \nproposed \nremedy is to legislate to alter the test for standing, requiring \nclaimants to show a more direct interest in the matter.  The Government appears to be committed to this course in principle.  The consultation focuses on the options for an appropriate new definition for standing.\n2.1.1\n              \nThe Law Society believes that t\nhere \nis no need to alter the test for standing.  The permission stage already acts as a filter mechanism, weeding out applicants \nwho \nare considered \"timewasters\" or \"busybodies\"\n.  \nThis \ninvolves an assessment by the judge of whether the applicant has sufficient \ninterest\n;\n a process which is not automatic.  \n2.1.2\n              \nAltering the test for standing appears to be designed to restrict the scope for non governmental bodies and charities to pursue an issue in the courts as they would have to demonstrate a direct interest i\nn the proceedings in order to be able to apply for judicial review.  NGOs and charities perform an invaluable service in taking up issues which affect groups of people rather than individuals.  In their absence it is likely that unlawful decisions will go \nunchallenged.\n  The two cases cited in the consultation paper – \nMaya Evans\n \nand \nWorld Development Movement\n, are both cases where no individual claimant was available to challenge decisions or practices that the court found to be unlawful.  In a later case,\n Maya Evans was denied standing because an affected individual was also bringing a claim.  In the \nWorld Development \nMovement\n case, \nit would have been unrealistic to expect an affected individual – and it is worth noting that any such potential claimant wou\nld in future be denied legal aid for non-compliance with the UK residence test that the Lord Chancellor proposes to introduce early next year.  \n2.1.3\n              \nThe consultation paper notes that challenges brought by public interest claimants are significantly more \nsuccessful than those brought by individuals.  R\nestricting standing \nis \nlikely to \nreduce the number of such claims and increase the number of cases where unlawful action by public authorities goes unchallenged.  Combined with \nthe reduction in legal aid, it \nwill mean that those with standing will not have the resources to litigate while those with the resources will not have the standing. \n2.1.4\n              \nThe Government is also proposing to modify the rules to discourage interveners and third parties in judicial review\n cases.  In reality \ninterveners \nperform a valuable role in assisting the court with additional information and the broader perspective\n.  They are often able to represent the interests of the wider community\n \nin addressing issues of public concern\n. F\nor examp\nle \n- \ncharity groups for disabled \npeople \nchallenging welfare changes.  Preventing such groups participating in judicial review cases \nwould  \nbe to the detriment of \ncivil \nsociety.  It will prevent the voice of those least able to represent themselves under th\ne law from being heard.\n  It is to be noted that Government departments frequently intervene in judicial review claims to put forward the interests of their department.  \n2.1.5\n              \nThe introduction of a costs risk for third party interveners will effectively cu\nrtail such interventions, since hard-pressed charities and NGOs will be deterred from intervening by the risk that an application for costs might be made against them.  The courts are able to control the scope of third party interventions without the need \nfor this additional power.  \n2.2\n              \nThe Law Society \nopposes the proposal to make legal aid payment for bringing a judicial review claim dependent on the grant of permission (with a residual discretion in the Legal Aid Agency \n(LAA) \nin cases settled befo\nre \npermission).  The Society \nrejects the Government’s assertion that “it is appropriate for all of the financial risk of the permission application to rest with the provider [lawyer]”.  It is not the responsibility of lawyers to underwrite members of the public seeking redress for fau\nlty decision making by public bodies.    \n2.2.1\n              \nThis \npotential \nfin\nancial penalty is \ncalculated to\n deter lawyers and members of the public from challenging public bodies.  \nIf this proposal is adopted, \na likely consequence is that \nlawyers \nwill \nfeel \nunable to\n assume the risk of \nnot being paid at all for the very substantial work involved in \nbringing legitimate cases to court\n.  Members of the public deprived of legal advice from lawyers (and legal assistance from NGOs and charities if the test for standing is a\ndopted) will confront the stark choice of trying to bring cases to court in person or letting a matter drop.  In practice either option will mean that individual’s access to justice has been significantly eroded.\n2.2.2\n              \nThe damaging effect of the proposal c\nannot be offset by the \nproposal \nthat in exceptional cases of general public interest the Legal Aid Agency has the discretion to award legal aid funding.  \nIt does not deal with cases settled between refusal and renewal of the permission application.  Furthe\nr, experience of the practice of the LAA and the\n \nLegal Services Commission\n \n(\nLSC\n)\n leads us to believe that the discretion will be exercised sparingly and slowly.  \n2.2.3\n              \nThe development of Protective Costs Orders \n(PCO) \nin public law cases has been beneficia\nl in \nensuring that public law wrongs are effectively challenged\n.  They have \npublic interest challengers to \nbring before the courts serious issues that the public interest requires should be litigated.  The conditions governing PCOs are tightly controlled a\nnd ensure that frivolous or trivial claims are filtered out.  \nAny restrictions on the availability of PCOs \nare \n likely to have the effect of deterring claims being brought which are in the public interest.\n2.3\n              \nThe Law Society agrees that minor defects which would have made no difference to the outcome should not necessitate an authority to revisit its decision.  \nThat is the current law.  \nHowever, t\nhe Law Society object\ns\n \non practical grounds \nto the \nproposal to enable cases to be \ndismissed at the permission stage on the grounds \nof no\n difference.  \nThe Law Society believes that i\nt would lead to full \nrehearsal \nof the arguments at the permission stage\n and be productive of delay and increased cost\n.  The op\ntion of applying a lower test\n -\n that it is highly likely that the outcome would be the same\n - \n would \nundermine the importance of consultation, public participation in decision-making and procedural fairness, which are important elements of a democratic soc\niety.  \n2.\n5\n              \nThe Law Society is concerned that the test remains fundamentally discriminatory and potentially unlawful under English and EU law.\n2.5.1\n              \nThe recent MOJ consultation \nJudicial review – proposals for further reform\n omitted to refer to the proposal in the earlier \nTransforming Legal Aid\n consultation paper to impose a 12 months lawful residency requirement for eligibility for civil legal aid. \n&#xa0;\nTh\nat proposal is clearly intended to restrict access to the courts. \n&#xa0;\nIt will have a particular impact on people challenging the decisions of public bodies in relation to asylum and immigration status.\n&#xa0;\n The Government has had to acknowledge the overwhelming c\nriticism of the proposal by exempting certain classes of people from the residence test.\n&#xa0;\n Nonetheless the Law Society remains of the view that the introduction of a residency test is not compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights or Common Law\n rights of access to the courts.\n&#xa0;\n It cannot be squared with Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination) when combined with Article 6 (right to a fair trial).\n&#xa0;\n The residency test would discriminate between people in relation to proceedings before the courts \nand for the purposes of legal aid eligibility.\n&#xa0;\n2.6\n              \nThe success rate in appeals to the Tribunal against immigration decisions in managed migration ca\nses (e.g. those seeking to work or study in the UK lawfully) stands at around 50%. This suggests that \npreliminary \ndecision-making is poor. Removing the right of appeal in all these cases will mean that the only way to challenge such decisions through an in\ndependent judicial process is by way of judicial review. \n2.6.1\n              \nMany such migrants (or potential migrants) would previously have been eligible for legal aid to challenge a negative decision by way of judicial review. Unfortunately the soon-to-be-introduced\n Residence Test will mean that such people are excluded from legal aid. By definition these people will not meet the Residence Test because either they will not be lawfully resident by the time they are able to seek to challenge a negative decision (contin\nuing leave under section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971 will cease once a decision is made on administrative review (clause 11 Immigration Bill 2013)) or they will be outside the UK. Those inside the UK will automatically become \noverstayers\n at this point a\nnd could face criminal sanction despite being the victim of a potentially unlawful decision. The number of people placed in this position will be significant in light of the success rate cited above. \n2.6.2\n              \nMoreover the proposed changes in the Immigration\n Bill\n&#xa0;\nwill further limit rights of appeal in immigration cases. This means that many decisions made in managed migration cases will not be able to be judicially challenged as there will be no right of appeal and no legal aid for judicial review. This will \nseverely restrict access to justice for those wishing to lawfully enter or remain in the United Kingdom\n.\n \n2.7\n              \nThe right of the ordinary citizen to challenge the decision of a public body is fundamental to the concepts of civil society a\nnd the rule of law.  \n2.7.1\n              \nIt is essential that there should be an effective legal right of protection against arbitrary or unlawful decisions by public bodies.\n2.7.2\n              \nIn the long term, i\nf the right to judicial review is reduced\n, many \nwill suffer.\n2.7.3\n              \nThe ordinary citizen will have less scope for seeking redress for wrongs which they may have suffered at the hands of public bodies.  Public trust in authority will in time be undermined.  \n2.7.4\n              \nThe proposals proceed from a fundamental misunderstanding of\n the nature of the judicial review remedy. \nNovember 2013\n \nR \n(on the application of Maya Evans) v Secretary of State for Defence \n[2010] EWHC 1445. \n \n \nWorld Development Movement Ltd \n[1995] 1 WLR 386 \n \n"
