&#xa0;Written evidence from Derwent Parish Council (TIC 088)&#xa0;1. How do Government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities? It is not known how they do this at present, but ideally, methods of information gathering should include: looking at Parish, Community &amp; Neighbourhood plans and building models on successful international examples.&#xa0; Where services are currently poor, people may not realise that it is even possible to run their lives using public transport.&#xa0; For this reason, simple questionnaires asking about demand may provide a be falsely low result compared to the possible success of schemes.&#xa0; It is important to educate people about benefits of public transport rather than just accepting the status quo (of it frequently being seen as unpopular, unreliable and therefore suffering from an ‘inbuilt’ lack of demand)&#xa0;2. To what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In rural Cumbria, provision for schoolchildren is felt to be good – mix of private taxi at public expense and school bus. There is no special provision for them for leisure and evening bus services are infrequent (where they happen at all).&#xa0; There is some provision for elderly/passengers with disabilities by way of low access buses. Ideally all buses should eventually be low access. &#xa0;3.How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?&#xa0; Our local Voluntary Car Service in Above Derwent is popular and well used, but it could not operate without financial help from Cumbria County Council &amp; the WI. Publicity, subsidy from CCC and publicity are all vital. &#xa0;4.To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services? If one starts from the position that it is important to maintain rural communities rather than allow them to wither on the vine and let the countryside become the preserve of the second home owners and holiday makers; then local people should only be expected to rely on demand led service where there is absolutely no alternative.&#xa0; In rural areas, inhabitants already get a poorer quality service for many facilities than in urban regions so public funding should be made available to provide public transport. &#xa0;5.What are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can these services be made more affordable? Privatisation has allowed bus companies to cherry pick the profitable routes.&#xa0; Bus companies should only be able to provide complete services so there is cross subsidy built in to the system.  In addition provision of mixed services should be considered (e.g. school buses being used by other passengers, school taxi’s being publicised and shared, post-buses etc)&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;
