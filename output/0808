&#xa0;[bold]1.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Parkinson’s UK welcomes the opportunity to participate in this inquiry into long-term conditions. This issue is particularly relevant to us due to the nature of Parkinson’s which is a long term, progressive and incurable condition. Although Parkinson’s can be well-managed with medication and treatment, there is no prospect of a person’s condition improving over time, and there is no cure. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Parkinson’s is an extremely complex condition. A wide range of therapeutic interventions are required to support people to remain independent and to maintain their quality of life for as long as possible. 
[normal]One study found that people with Parkinson’s require input from up to 25 specialists
[normal]. However, there are huge gaps in provisions of these services across the UK. The APPG on Parkinson’s report in 2009 revealed major inequalities across the whole of the UK in access to care services for people with Parkinson’s
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Parkinson's nurses
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]are a local source of expert knowledge and can provide valuable help in supporting people coming to terms with their Parkinson's diagnosis as well as offering guidance on managing medication and making appropriate referrals. Parkinson’s UK has 
[normal]found that the provision of a single Parkinson’s nurse can provide an average annual saving of £43,812 in consultant appointments, £80,000 in avoided hospital admissions and £147,021 in avoided overnight stays in hospital
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Another key element to providing integrated care for people with Parkinson’s is the development and use of a personal care plan designed to meet their specific needs. However, a study has revealed that only 22% of people with neurological conditions receive a personal care plan
[normal].
[normal] Although the Government has cited research claiming 70% of people with long-term conditions did not want a written care plan
[normal], we believe that this would improve the standard of care for Parkinson’s. Therefore, we would like to see everyone with Parkinson’s with have a care plan that is drawn up in collaboration with them and is then implemented and regularly reviewed.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]NHS continuing health care is a package of funded care for people with a ‘primary health need’ – it should be a mechanism for providing personalised services for people with long-term health conditions. For people with Parkinson’s, the need for NHS continuing health care tends to come at an advanced stage of the condition. In practice, people applying for NHS continuing health care often experience delays, difficulties in accessing it and distress at a time when they are coping with managing their condition. Worryingly people with Parkinson’s (and other long term conditions) end up using the means tested social care system instead to get the support that they should be getting through the NHS. This is extremely concerning to us and one of the reasons why the APPG on Parkinson’s is currently holding an inquiry into NHS continuing health care. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Cost-shunting between the NHS and social services can make it extremely difficult for people with Parkinson’s to receive holistic, integrated care. We hope that the advent of Health and Wellbeing Boards (HWBs) will provide and opportunity for health and social care to work in a 
[normal]more integrated way for people with long term conditions; however whilst one system is means tested and the other is free at the point of delivery, it is difficult to imagine how true integration will be actualised. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In order for people with Parkinson’s to receive community-based care, it is important that they have access to the appropriate professionals. A survey conducted by Parkinson’s UK in 2011 revealed that 27% of Parkinson’s nurses were being asked to stop home visits and take on more general nursing duties on the wards to fill in gaps created by other nurse posts.
[normal] We also have evidence that people sometimes find it difficult to access appropriate therapists, particularly speech and language therapists. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Another key element that can support the treatment of long-term conditions in the community is the information and support provided by voluntary sector organisations. In the case of Parkinson’s UK, this information and support includes information about managing the condition, self-care programmes and the provision of peer support networks. However, we are aware that not everyone with long-term conditions is aware that this support is available to them. Parkinson’s UK feels that this is a missed opportunity to better support the care of long-term conditions when patients are in a community setting. We would like to see better signposting from health and social care professionals to these sources of information and support.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The advent of the new NHS means decision making about services for people with Parkinson’s will fall to clinical commissioning groups (CCGs). CCGs must have the appropriate skills and understanding in order to commission neurology. This is particularly important with less common conditions such as Parkinson’s and clinical commissioning groups may not have had much experience of such conditions before.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We recognise that support to commissioners is really important which is why we set up (with our partners MS Society, Motor Neurone Disease Association and Epilepsy Society as an affiliate member), Neurological Commissioning Support (NCS) who work with commissioners to map neurology services and analyse identified gaps. Working with the commissioners, NCS can then help to develop solutions to develop appropriate services. One example of this is the specific integrated care pathway for Parkinson’s developed by NCS. The pathway, which covers primary, secondary, tertiary and social care ensures integration of health and social care with the user at the centre of the decision making process. The aim is to support commissioners and service providers to improve quality of care for neurological conditions in a cost-effective way.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]5.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Parkinson’s UK believes that better integration across health and social care would result in a higher standard and quality of care for people with Parkinson’s and other long-term conditions.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A good example of this is the work that Neurological Commissioning Support, has developed as described in section 4. Neurological Commissioning Support takes an integrated approach to both assessing services in a local area and to devising solutions to developing new services and care pathways.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The use of Parkinson’s nurses can result in a more integrated and cost-effective approach to supporting people with Parkinson’s by working with health and social care professionals and referring people on. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our own Information and Support Workers (ISWs) are another example of effective integration. As well as working with both health and social care providers across the UK, our ISWs also provide emotional support to people with Parkinson’s and their families, as well as assistance with other issues such as applying for benefits.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]6.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As Parkinson’s is a condition that predominately affects older people, the impact on service provision for an ageing population is of particular concern to Parkinson’s UK. Parkinson’s UK has conducted research that predicts an increase of 28% in the number of people with Parkinson’s in the UK by 2020. This will mean that there will be approximately 162,000 people in the UK living with Parkinson’s by 2020.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We already have concerns that the existing levels of provision of services for people with Parkinson’s are not sufficient to meet current needs. One example of this is the workload of Parkinson’s nurses. The current NICE guidance recommends that the average caseload of a Parkinson’s nurse is 300 patients per nurse
[normal]. In 2011, Parkinson’s UK surveyed Parkinson’s nurses in England and found that 19% of them had caseloads of over 700 patients.
[normal] This caseload limits their capacity to provide appropriate care to all Parkinson’s patients at the current numbers. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]7.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The interaction between mental health conditions and long-term physical conditions is particularly pertinent to people with Parkinson’s, as the impact is not always recognised and the effects can be severe. 
[normal]There are different factors that link mental health problems and Parkinson’s: it can be part of the condition, for example changes to the chemicals in the brain that are part of Parkinson’s could also cause depression and anxiety; mental health problems can be caused by the difficulties of living with Parkinson’s, for example not being able to move can make people more anxious and may even cause panic attacks;
[normal] 
[normal]Parkinson’s medication can have side-effects including psychosis and compulsive behaviours.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Dementia is also common and one in three people with Parkinson’s have some form of dementia and up to 80% of people with Parkinson’s may develop dementia.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The impact of these mental health conditions can be severe for people with Parkinson’s, which can include getting into debt, experiencing marriage breakups or even being arrested as a result.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In 2007 we surveyed 13,000 members
[normal] and their responses show how widespread the experience of mental ill health is for people with Parkinson’s. In the month before the survey: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Access to treatment for mental health problems is poor. Only 11% of people with Parkinson’s have seen a mental health professional which is the lowest of any therapeutic input for Parkinson’s.
[normal]8.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]With regards to personalised services, it’s encouraging that those receiving NHS continuing healthcare will soon be able to access a personal health budget (from 2014). Parkinson’s UK would like to see the option of personal health budgets being made more available to people with Parkinson’s and those with other long term conditions. The success of the budgets will of course be reliant on the availability of locals support and services and good care planning with the user at the centre of their care. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The inquiry covers many of the issues associated with the care of long-term conditions in the terms of reference but there are additional issues that are particularly relevant to the treatment and support of people with Parkinson’s, which we have briefly detailed below. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]9.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Neurological services have tended to be of low priority within the NHS, resulting in patchy levels of provision and poor support for patients. A report from 
[normal]the National Audit Office in 2011 found neurology services were fragmented and poorly coordinated. Worryingly, emergency hospital admissions had increased by 32% between 2004-5 and 2009-10, compared to 17% for the NHS as a whole.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The
[normal]i
[normal]r concerns were echoed by the Public Accounts Committee in their report in 2012.
[normal]. The committee highlighted that, despite the introduction of the National Service Framework (NSF) for Long-term Conditions, it had not improved standards of care and 
[normal]that neurological care lagged behind priority areas such as cancer and stroke. PAC made a number of recommendations, including: a National Clinical Lead for neurology; local neurological networks coordinated by the NHS; access to a care plan for everyone with a neurological condition, covering both health and social care; the department mandating joint health and social care commissioning; and the development of a generic quality standard for neurological conditions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Progress has being made with some of the PAC recommendations, for example, a clinical director has been appointed and strategic clinical networks covering neurology are currently being set up. However, we are still awaiting the development and publication of the NICE quality standard for Parkinson’s and the quality standard for neurological conditions
[normal]. The updated NICE guideline for Parkinson’s is now long overdue. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The lack of neurological indicators and outcomes in the NHS commissioning outcomes frameworks are also of serious concern to us. 
[normal]There is a real danger that commissioners will focus on the targets that are set by the COF indicators and not engage with those indicators that are cross-cutting and more difficult to demonstrate.

[normal]About Parkinson’s UK[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]10.1 
[normal]              
[normal]Every hour, someone in the UK is told they have Parkinson’s. One in 20 is under the age of 40. There are approximately 127,000 people with Parkinson’s in the UK.
[normal]10.2 
[normal]              
[normal]We bring people with Parkinson’s, their carers and families together via our network of local groups, our website and free confidential helpline. Specialist nurses, our supporters and staff provide information and training on every aspect of Parkinson’s.
[normal]10.3 
[normal]              
[normal]As the UK’s Parkinson’s support and research charity we’re leading the work to find a cure, and we’re closer than ever. We also campaign to change attitudes and demand better services.
[normal]10.4 
[normal]              
[normal]Parkinson’s is a progressive neurological disorder for which there is currently no cure. It is associated with the death of nerve cells in the mid-brain which results in the loss of the chemical messenger dopamine. This affects learned voluntary movements such as walking, 
[normal]talking, writing and swallowing. As the condition progresses it impacts on all aspects of the person’s life and the lives of those around them.
[normal]10.5 
[normal]              
[normal]As well as the symptoms that affect movement, people with Parkinson’s can find that other issues, such as tiredness, pain, depression and constipation, can have an impact on their day-to-day lives
