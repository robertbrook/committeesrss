[normal]EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
[normal]UK
[normal] policy re 
[normal]“
[normal]Heat
[normal]” cannot be sensibly formulated 
[normal]unless it is co-ordinated from the start 
[normal]with 
[normal]policies relating to electricity generation and distribution
[normal]; the 
[normal]UK
[normal] cannot achieve its stated aims 
[normal]for Greenhouse Gas emissions reduction 
[normal]unless the electricity grid is in 
[normal]future operated for the public good 
[normal]rather than run for maximum profit.
[normal]  Furthermore, unless better prices are offered for electricity exported by 
[normal]homes or businesses 
[normal]generating green electricity
[normal], more and more green electricity will end up being converted
[normal] into heat, and not being “fed in”.
[normal]  Biomass is probably best used as a petrochemical feedstock; 
[normal]any process which burns biomass and rejects significant quantities of waste heat should have its claimed carbon savings 
[normal]factored downwards.  
[normal]All new houses sho
[normal]uld have solar hot water systems installed.  
[normal]As ever, building 
[normal]fabric energy efficiency 
[normal]is 
[normal]the weakest link.
