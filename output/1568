defaultHeat
default” cannot be sensibly formulated 
defaultunless it is co-ordinated from the start 
defaultwith 
defaultpolicies relating to electricity generation and distribution
default; the 
defaultUK

defaultfor Greenhouse Gas emissions reduction 
defaultunless the electricity grid is in 
defaultfuture operated for the public good 
defaultrather than run for maximum profit.
default  Furthermore, unless better prices are offered for electricity exported by 
defaulthomes or businesses 
defaultgenerating green electricity
default, more and more green electricity will end up being converted
default into heat, and not being “fed in”.
default  Biomass is probably best used as a petrochemical feedstock; 
defaultany process which burns biomass and rejects significant quantities of waste heat should have its claimed carbon savings 
defaultfactored downwards.  
defaultAll new houses sho
