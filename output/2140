[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Call for written evidence: draft Deregulation Bill[bold]Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland Submission[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Summary
[normal]Friends of the Earth is concerned that the draft Deregulation Bill
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. Friends of the Earth is concerned that many of the provisions of the draft Bill are not compatible with the UK’s environmental and social goals, in particular the UK Government’s Sustainable Development Strategy which emphasises the need to “make care for the environment an integral part of policy from the start, rather than dealing with the consequences of neglect down the line”. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. The Government cannot seriously consider that organisations who are there to protect public health (Care Quality Commission), ensure standards in children’s services (
[normal]Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills)
[normal], protect our environment that we all live in and depend upon (Natural England, Environment Agency, Marine Management Organisation etc), and our rights (Information Commissioner’s Office) should have their duties watered down by the addition of an ‘economic growth duty’ (regulators listed in Annex A of the Government’s response to the consultation on ‘Non-economic regulators: Duty to have regard to growth’).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. We are also concerned that the necessary cross-departmental approach has not been taken leading to an incompatibility between the draft Bill and both the Coalition’s overall programme for Government and more specific Government policies such as the Community Energy Strategy. We expand on this further below.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. As we have previously highlighted in our consultation response regarding the proposed growth duty dated 19 April 2013, we are concerned that the Government risks undermining public legitimacy and raising huge public concern by watering down the public interest duties of regulators. Our society and environmental safety depend upon regulators which prioritise these issues and ensure that their statutory duties are met. Public trust depends upon knowing that a 
[normal]regulator
[normal] has the best interests of the public as a whole at heart. Knowing that a regulator would have to consider business interests to the possible detriment of the exercise of their functions would undermine this public trust.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. As this is an open Call for Evidence, we have raised specific issues pertinent to our concerns, rather than focussing on the general questions listed by the Joint Committee. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Specific issues
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Power to [bold]disapply[bold] legislation no longer of practical use[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]6. 
[normal]We do not believe that the p
[normal]owers introduced by Cl
[normal]auses 50 to 57
[normal] of the draft Bill
[normal] are n
[normal]ecessary or appropriate because (
[normal]i
[normal]) 
[normal]there are not appropriate safeguards in place for the 
[normal]exercise of such an open-ended, widely drafted power; and
[normal] (ii) 
[normal]there are existing deregulatory mechanisms already in force (with more extensive and necessary safeguards in place) which could be used to achieve the same effect.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7. Taking
[normal] one example
[normal] of an existing procedure
[normal], the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 (“
[normal]LRRA[bold]”) 
[normal]creates the power for a Minister to make an Order 
[normal]removing or reducing any burden, or the overall burdens, resulting directly or indirectly for any person from any legislation
[normal]. We consider that the new power introduced by the draft Bill is therefore already sufficiently provided for in the LRRA. It is not clear how these powers could, or would, be differentiated. Duplication of this power in the draft Bill will only lead to confusion, misapplication and increased (rather than reduced) red tape.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8. The LRRA also s
[normal]ets out 
[normal]necessary “preconditions”
[normal] that must be 
[normal]met
[normal] before a Legislative Reform Order i
[normal]s made. Such preconditions include proportionality, striking a fair balance between public interest and persons adversely affected, not removing any necessary protection and not 
[normal]prevent
[normal]ing
[normal] any person from continuing to exercise any right or freedom which that person might reasonably expect to continue to exercise
[normal]. In addition, t
[normal]he consultation duty set out in the LRRA is much more proportionate and reasonable
[normal] than the draft Bill and includes a duty to consult with representative organisations, statutory bodies, relevant law commissions and such other persons considered appropriate. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9. In contrast, t
[normal]he 
[normal]draft
[normal] Bill 
[normal]does not contain adequate safeguards on the exercise of the power. There are no preconditions or tests that need to be met before an Order is made. The consultation requirements are also narrower and are significantly weakened by the inclusion of the caveat “in such cases as the Minister considers appropriate”. It should also be noted that there is no requirement included in Clauses 50 to 57 for any consideration made by the Minister to be “reasonable” nor is there any explanation of the meaning of “no longer of practical use” which gives the Minister an unacceptably wide discretion for the repeal of existing legislation, undermining the role of Parliament.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10. Clauses 50 to 57 should be removed from the draft Bill.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Removal of consultation requirements[bold]&#xa0;[bold]11. The draft Bill weakens the government’s overall consultation duties by removing specified statutory duties to consult (Clause 47 and Schedule 15). The majority of the consultation requirements to be removed by the draft Bill relate to the environment and greatly reduce participation rights of affected persons, including regulators such as Natural England. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12. Consultation is a core element of a democratic government and serves as one of the main ways that Government can be held to account for their actions. Consultation contributes to increasing public trust in government and is essential for developing policy and legislation as it provides access to wider sources of information, opinions, potential issues and solutions. The Government risks undermining its legitimacy and triggering public outcry by removing statutory consultation requirements. The statement in Schedule 15 that the Government considers these statutory requirements to consult as “unnecessary” is neither satisfactory nor sufficient to justify this removal.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13. More specifically, the UK is a party to the Aarhus Convention which binds the UK to provide the public with (amongst other things) a right to participate in decision-making in any proposed activities which may have a significant effect on the environment and/or during the preparation of plans and programmes relating to the environment. The removal of a requirement to consult on the exercise of various powers which relate to the environment directly conflicts with the requirements of the Aarhus Convention. The Aarhus Convention 
[normal]stems from Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration, which opens with the recognition that:  “
[normal]Environmental issues are best handled with participation of all concerned citizens, at the relevant level.
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14. The Government should be asked to explain and justify the removal of each of the consultation requirements and confirm how the UK's public participation obligation pursuant to the Aarhus Convention will be discharged in each case.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Duty to have regard to the desirability of promoting economic growth[bold]&#xa0;[bold]15. 
[normal]General
[normal]: t
[normal]he
[normal] duty 
[normal]to have regard to the desirability of promoting economic growth 
[normal]will apply to regulatory functions specified in statutory instruments 
[normal](SI) 
[normal]ma
[normal]de pursuant to the Deregulation Act. I
[normal]t is therefore unclear how the duty will specifically affect environmental regulators 
[normal](and the regulated) in practice and our comments must be read in this context. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16. The power to introduce the detail of the proposed growth duty by way of SI creates further concern as SIs are not subject to the same scrutiny or consultation procedure as primary legislation. There is therefore a serious risk that environmental regulators will 
[normal]face a fundamental 
[normal]distortion of their statutory duties by virtue of the passing of a 40 day period (including non-working days and any adjournment or prorogue of 4 days or less (Clause 56(8) of the draft Bill)) without any further debate or vote i.e. a negative affirmation procedure in Parliament. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17. At the very least, the draft Bill should include a specific duty to consult with representative organisations, regulators and affected persons (i.e. the public) as a precondition to issuing such SIs, and preferably a hearing or evidence session with MPs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18. 
[normal]Incompatible with wider government policy
[normal]: in May 2010 the coalition committed to (
[normal]i
[normal]) create a presumption in favour of sustainable development, (ii) protect wildlife and promote green spaces and (iii) maintain existing environmental protections. The introduction of a duty on non-economic regulators to promote economic growth is contrary to such commitments.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]19. The Government’s 2011 Natural Environment White Paper reinforces the importance of these principles and states that the Government “
[normal]will 
[normal]put the value of nature at the heart of [its] decision making” and will “retain the protection and 
[normal]improvement of 
[normal]the natural environment as core 
[normal]objectives of the planning system
[normal]”. Once again, the introduction of a duty on non-economic regulators to promote economic growth is contrary to such commitments.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20. 
[normal]Incompatible with existing duties
[normal]: 
[normal]we are
[normal] concern
[normal]ed
[normal] that the proposed growth duty competes with and undermines other
[normal] environmental
[normal] regulatory requirements in a way which could lead to confusion and a less consistent and transparent application of the law, to the detriment of the environmental regulatory process as a whole. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]21. 
[normal]For example, pursuant to the Environment Act 1995, the Environment Agency’s principal aim 
[normal]“in discharging its functions so 
[normal]to protect or enhance the environment, taken as a whole, as to make the contribution towards attaining the objective of achieving sustainable development”. Sustainable development is a well understood existing concept which is already reflected in legislation
[normal], and has a global definition and expression through the Rio Declaration 1992
[normal]. 
[normal]Defra
[normal] defines sustainable development as “
[normal]encouraging economic growth 
[normal]while protecting the environment and improving our quality of life[bold]” (emphasis added). The environmental protection point is relevant to this proposal.
[normal] 
[normal]The proposed duty will 
[normal]distort the understanding and operation of existing sustainable development duties and lead to 
[normal]an undermining of the role of the regulator. The Minister stated in the response to the first consultation on the proposals that “
[normal]The Government does not wish to detract from nor 
[normal]undermine the core purpose of these regulatory bodies
[normal].” However the duty would have to be “enforceable” and clearly risks undermining the core purpose of the regulators by giving “economic growth” more weight. The problem is a) that ‘economic growth’ is ill-defined and b) that this represents a risk of conflict of interest. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]22. The Government’s response to the consultation does not clarify how “growth” would be “balanced” with environmental objectives. The Government should not proceed with this proposal without more detail on its function and framing. The Government says in its response to the earlier consultation: “
[normal]The Government intends that guidance to accompany the growth duty will include further detail as to the meaning of economic growth for regulators
[normal] operating in different fields.” 
[normal](Government response, July 2013, 
[normal]http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/brdo/docs/publications-2013/13-1018-growth-consultation-response.pdf
[normal]).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]No ‘growth’ duty can be imposed without much further clarification of what the Government means, nor can the duty be framed in such a way as to 
[normal]override the 
[normal]pr
[normal]imary functions of the regulator.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]23. 
[normal]Duplication of duties
[normal]Unnecessary duplication of existing legislation should be avoided.
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal] lack of clarity about how the differing duties sit together and interact is likely to weaken the regulatory process
[normal], and for example result in greater costs to the public purse in the form of environmental damage
[normal].
[normal] The cost to society e.g. of failing to act on climate change, failing to protect biodiversity, pollution of soils, air and water – should be borne by the polluter under the principle that the polluter pays. As - for example - the Environment Agency seeks to prevent these costs arising, it is not in the interest of the UK to create a race to the bottom in terms of poor regulation and environmental practices. Rather the Government should focus on stronger, clearer, environmental regulation that creates a race to the top in terms of development, and the benefits of that.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]24. 
[normal]I
[normal]ncreased litigation potential:
[normal] the proposed duty will create more onerous requirements to be discharged by the regulators, increasing the potential for adverse scrutiny by interested parties, thereby exposing the regulators to a greater risk of judicial review. The level of resource needed to deal with such challenges is significant as well as the adverse impact of judicial review challenges on the reputation and standing of individual regulators. 
[normal]There is also a concern that the regulators could discharge this new domestic duty in a way that is inconsistent with duties under wider European law thereby risking infringement proceedings being brought by the European Commission.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]25. 
[normal]Increased costs:
[normal] [bold]the introduction of a statutory duty to promote economic growth will inevitably lead to increased costs for the regulators. This is likely to 
[normal]materialise
[normal] through the increased administrative costs involved in data collection and record maintenance to capture and demonstrate compliance in each individual case. Increased cost associated with training, guidance and advice relating to the new duty is also anticipated. Increased costs are also likely to affect the way that resources are deployed within a regulator’s 
[normal]organisation
[normal] which will inevitably have wider implications. These increased burdens on the regulator increase public costs, with poorer public interest outcomes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Reduction of duties relating to energy and climate change[bold]&#xa0;[bold]26. In May 2010, the government committed to encouraging community owned renewable-energy schemes in the Coalition Agreement. This has been delivered by way of DECC’s launch of the Community Energy Strategy. The reduction of duties relating to energy and climate change set out in clause 27 of the draft Bill appear to specifically contradict this commitment and undermine the recent statements supporting community energy made by 
[normal]Edward Davey MP and Greg Barker MP. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Conclusion
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]27. The impact of the draft Bill on environmental regulators and our society is not consistent with the Government’s stated goals on the protection of the environment. The ability of environmental regulators to discharge their primary statutory duties will be significantly undermined as will the effectiveness of existing environmental legislation. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]28. We hope that the Government will reconsider the issues we have highlighted above and address the inconsistencies and contradictions that the draft Bill creates.
