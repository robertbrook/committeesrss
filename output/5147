defaultIntroduction
defaultWhy the number of arrests, prosecutions and convictions for tobacco smuggling have f
defaultallen over the past three years
defaultWhy Border Force failed to meet its operational targets for tobacco seizure in 2012–13
default(a) 
default              
defaultMethods of smuggling tobacco into the UK are varied and variable, making detection and seizure a challenging process
default.
default(b) 
default              
defaultSeizures outside of the UK have gone up and Sir Charles suggests that this should mean less illicit tobacco is making its way into the UK.  In this regard, we note that work undertaken by HMRC outside the UK through its network of Fiscal Crime Liaison Officers has prevented illicit tobacco products from reaching UK borders. Overall cigarette seizures, regardless 
defaultof 
defaultwhere they take place (e.g. inland, border and overseas), have remained consistently high at between 1.7 and 1.9 billion cigarettes per annum over the past five years.  
defaultThere has also been an upward trend in the amount of HRT seized over the same period.
default(c) 
default              
defaultTwo UK Border Force initiatives failed to deliver as anticipated. 
defaultWhether the current sanctions and penalties for tobacco smuggling are appropriate
defaultThe similarities and differences in patterns of tobacco smuggling in the UK and Ireland, how they affect each other, and the implications of the restrictions on National Crime Agency
default operations in Northern Ireland
defaultThe possible impact of the introduction of standardised packaging in Ireland on the quantity and availability of illegal tobacco in the UK
default(a) 
default              
defaultIllicit trade is inherently difficult to measure (both in terms of existing levels, changes over time and the causes of those changes).
default(b)
default              
defaultAustralia is the only country in the world which has plain packaging in place and it is too early to assess in a meaningful sense the impacts of plain packaging there.
default 
default 
default              
default 
default(c) 
default              
defaultThere is, as far as JTI is aware, no established/recognised research base on the actual impacts (in terms of illicit trade or otherwise) on a neighbouring state of another having such a measure in place.
default 
defaultIt is right therefore that this Committee has called for evidence in respect of "the possible impact" of the introduction of plain packaging in Ireland on the illicit trade in tobacco in the UK and JTI has provided below its best assessment of such impacts. 
defaultReduced costs burdens for illicit traders
default“
default[P]
defaultlain packaging is highly likely to aggravate the existing negative impacts of the already serious and socially damaging trade in illicit tobacco. Since illicit products are often more accessible to those underage and those from low income groups, plain pack laws risk undermining a key objective of plain packaging: to reduce smoking by these groups
default.
default”
defaultThe pre-existing impact of Irish illicit trade on the UK
default“[Crime groups]
default have already recognised a porous land border, and that is a weakness that we in law enforcement have to eradicate. We have a huge challenge on the island of Ireland as a whole, particularly around organised crime and serious harm, be it drugs or human trafficking in all its guises
default.”

defaultIn December 2009, the Irish Minister of Finance announced that the government: “decided not to make any changes to excise on tobacco in this Budget because [the Minister of Finance] believe[s] the high price is now giving rise to massive cigarette smuggling”.

defaultIncreased consumer complicitydefault defaultThe impacts of increased criminality in the UK 
default“
defaultChildren who buy cheap tobacco can come into contact with criminals. Some children are talked into selling cheap cigarettes on to school mates. People selling cheap tobacco are more likely to be selling other things illegally (DVDs, alcohol), exposing our children to more dangers

default&#xa0;
default Given the limitation on the length of submissions to the Inquiry, JTI have sought only to address the specific questions raised by the Committee.  JTI notes, however, that there are diverging views about the current illicit trade in tobacco products and how plain packaging risks exacerbating it, as reflected by criticism of JTI's related 2012 media campaign by certain tobacco control groups which were, in part, upheld by the ASA.  JTI disagrees with the ASA's conclusions and remains of the view that these adverts provide an important contribution to the political debate.
default Based on Empty Pack Surveys (
defaultEPSdefault).  The EPS involves the physical collection of discarded empty cigarette packs. Upon collection, samples are either sent to independent or manufacturer laboratories for analysis as to their authenticity. In 2012, around 25,000 packs were collected from 105 sample points across the UK.

default The Taylor Report on Tobacco Smuggling was prepared by Martin Taylor for the then Chancellor, Gordon Brown.
default Separately, JTI have produced a number of documents that address the issue of illicit trade in more detail and we would be happy to provide the Committee with copies of these.  Such documents include our “Response to the Department of Health’s Consultation on the Standardised Packaging of Tobacco Products”, July 2012 (available at

default As noted in the Zimmerman Report “
defaultIn general, attempting to measure the global value of illicitly traded products is inherently difficult, and there are no reliable global statistics
