&#xa0;Written evidence from Liam Good (CYS0078)I urge the committee to conduct a full economic assessment of the costs to society of motorised transport.  These costs should include measure of:-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; costs of road maintenance, with consideration to the fact that damage to roads increases exponentially with vehicle weight (basic physics).-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; costs of lung diseases caused by pollution-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; costs of obesity and diabetes (among other diseases) which are in large part caused by immobility-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; costs of dedicating massive areas of cities to road surfaces and parking. This would include for example damage caused by flooding due to poor water absorption in areas that are heavily sealed-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; costs of environmental damage-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; costs of cleaning up after cars-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; costs of having to sound proof buildings near roads-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; costs of pollution damage to public and private buildings-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; costs of licencing, policing, administration and accounting associated with motorised transportThis is a partial list, but a tally of such costs will help:-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; the committee to begin to appreciate that any costs absorbed through infrastructure investment in cycling are miniscule in comparison to the massive costs absorbed to maintain motorised transport.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; to counter the idiotic statements made by motorists who suggest that the road tax they pay covers the costs of damage-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; us to begin to understand that motorised vehicles cost society heavily in many different waysFinally, the committee should appreciate that, with the majority of voters being motorists, politicians will find it difficult to do the right thing with regard to transport policy.  There will always be costs associated with the need for transport.   We should understand these costs and then appreciate that progress can be made with cycling, which incurs far fewer costs and even provides health benefit.It is a no-brainer, but there are a lot of low-brainers out there who have been stopping progress away from our bike unfriendly infrastructure.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
