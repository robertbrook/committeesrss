[normal]Written evidence submitted by the [bold]Tyndall [bold]Centre for Climate Change Research[bold] (CLC021)[bold]              
[normal]This submission presents research on three topics 
[normal]relevant to the inquiry, 
[normal]namely
[normal];
[normal] i) discussion
[normal]s
[normal] with 
[normal]members of 
[normal]the public about novel and unfamiliar climate change mitigation technologies, ii) 
[normal]research into 
[normal]social dilemma theory 
[normal]suggesting that
[normal] particular aspects of knowledge about climate change are key, and iii) the study of local energy developments which br
[normal]ing climate change discourse into people
[normal]s
[normal]’
[normal] everyday lives. Our conclusions drawn from these research areas are structured according to the questions specified in the terms of the inquiry rather than by topic.
