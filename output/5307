[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Framework for achieving goals [bold]The Building Child Resilience [bold]I[bold]ntervention[bold]This programme lies at the heart of the project and was 
[normal]developed to help school communities
[normal] deal with the ongoing conflict and threat of terror. The model involves training and empowering teachers to dea
[normal]l first with their own distress
[normal] and then with that of their students. Sessions consisting of psycho-education, skill
[normal]s
[normal] development and training e
[normal]ncourage teachers to take their new found knowledge and skills and apply them in the classroom.

[normal]The c

[normal]the
[normal] position as Palestinians mo
[normal]re difficult to collaborate
[normal]. Rocket and other attacks on the Israelis can also have a negative impact.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Lack of adequate resources
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Lack of systematic technical support from a third party to make the process less politicised.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Inadequate technical 
[normal]expertise on the Palestinian side especially in dealing with trauma, clinical supervision, monitoring and evaluation of community based interven
[normal]tions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The lapse of time between joint plans and the availability of funding.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Difficulty in implementing such 
[normal]projects in Gaza because of 
[normal]the 
[normal]difficulty in traveling to Gaza from West bank and the radical position of Hamas to 
[normal]not 
[normal]allow any joint collaboration.
