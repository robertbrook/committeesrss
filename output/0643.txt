[[[The James Hutton Institute]]]

[[[ (CLC023)]]]&#xa0;The James Hutton Institute welcomes the opportunity to provide views to the UK Parliament on the public understanding of climate change and its policy implications. The Institute was formed on 1st April 2011 when SCRI (Scottish Crop Research Institute) and the Macaulay Land Use Research Institute joined forces to create one of the world’s leading scientific organisations focusing on people, land, crops, water and the environment. The Institute has a significant programme of inter-disciplinary research (including social sciences) on climate change as it relates to food, water security, and provision of ecosystem services. Staff at the Institute have coordinated and been partners in research projects looking at all aspects of climate change for funders including policy makers such as the Scottish Government and the EU. &#xa0;This response is based on research undertaken by the James Hutton Institute, partners and in the broader literature, from natural and social scientists working on different aspects of climate change including mitigation, adaptation, and significance, risk and uncertainty. &#xa0;

[[[Summary of responses:]]]&#xa0;Declaration of interest: The James Hutton Institute is a not-for-profit research institute and has no vested interests in matters arising from the responses provided.&#xa0;Research undertaken by The James Hutton Institute, partners and in the broader literature shows that:&#xa0;1.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; In general, the seriousness of climate change is broadly understood by the public, but not universally accepted (i.e. GILDED European Policy Brief 4, COST Action 2009, Walthall et al 2013).1.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; Public understanding of climate change science may be becoming increasingly well understood, but this is not necessarily reflected in people’s beliefs and behaviours (IPCC AR4 2007 and comments below).1.2.1. However, climate change as a concept and the way it affects people is poorly understood by the public, and is easily confused with other aspects of climate, such as the weather. 1.2.2. Interviews with the public indicate that climate change is perceived as an abstract, scientific concept. To become more meaningful this concept needs to be translated into actions and images in relation to everyday life, e.g. anchoring the idea of climate change in the concept of air pollution, and the objectification of this idea as ‘smoking chimney stacks’ or fumes from car exhausts. Such an approach translates climate change into a more concrete, tangible reality that people can relate to (GILDED 2012).1.2.3. However, this only addresses the perceived ‘visible’ aspect of greenhouse gas emissions as pollution, not from sources like fertiliser applications and resultant N2O (GHG and ozone depleting), which the public are generally unaware of.1.2.4. There is confusion in the terms of [anthropogenic] global warming and climate change. 1.2.5. Public uncertainty about climate change may have remained stable between 2003 and 2008 but the extent to which people believed that climate change claims had been exaggerated doubled over that period (Whitmarsh 2011).1.2.6. Our belief is that, through media coverage (particularly of extreme events), there is a better understanding of the role of climate features, particularly the northern hemisphere polar jet stream, in influencing the weather.1.2.7. It is unclear how well the public understand the consequences of different levels of projected warming (i.e. 2°C, 4°C or 6°C) which would be better served by scenario examples, but we suspect understanding is rather weak.1.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; The state of public understanding and associated beliefs is fluid and influenced by multiple factors and sources: 1.3.1. Local weather is seen to be representative of global trends, with a disassociation between local weather conditions, anomalies elsewhere (i.e. cold winter of 2010/11 in UK and anomalous high temperatures in Canada, Greenland and Russia) and overall global trends.1.3.2. The LOCAW project has found that there are often large differences in the way people conceptualise environmental problems at home and at work.  In part this is due to the differences in the social context and dynamics of home and work, but there are also important psychological mechanisms explaining this separation.1.3.3. Exposure to scientific information cannot entirely explain the levels of public concern; views on climate change are largely affected by the actions of political groups, including statements by political leaders (Brechin 2012), or occurrence of extreme events (i.e. Hurricane Sandy in 2012). 1.3.4. People whose livelihoods have a direct relationship with the climate (i.e. farmers, foresters, recreation / tourism) are more perceptive of observed changes and likely to undertake changes in behaviour in order to adapt (Matthews et al 2007, Matthews et al 2008, McCrum 2009).1.3.4.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Such stakeholders can cope with significant complexity (McCrum et al. 2009) but need to be “stepped into” the issues of utilising climate change projections (to inform adaptation options) in a structured way that increases their confidence and enhances the credibility of the projections.1.4.&#xa0;&#xa0; There appears to be a disconnection between perceptions of risk and understanding of the current rate of greenhouse gas emissions, i.e. risk of exceeding the 2°C warming limit and 2012 CO2 emissions being 58% greater than 1990 levels (Peters et al 2013), and how consumption based economies drive this.1.4.1. It is likely that there is a lack of awareness of the issue of energy and resource use intensity and extent, i.e. we may use energy more efficiently but overall use more of it overall (Jevons’ Paradox: the proposition that technological progress that increases the efficiency with which a resource is used tends to increase (rather than decrease) the rate of consumption of that resource) (SMILE 2011).1.5.&#xa0;&#xa0; Public perception focuses on climate change being associated with energy and fossil fuel consumption only in releasing greenhouse gases (responses limited to things like tree-planting concerning carbon sequestration efforts (Nijnik et al., 2009; Slee et al., 2012)), with little connection made to the GHG consequences from loss of biodiversity, deforestation, degrading ecosystem services (particularly climate regulation and decreasing carbon sink capacity) and ocean acidification (Trumper et al 2009, Nijnik and Halder, 2012; Dyer and Nijnik, in press). 1.5.1. There is an absence of awareness by the public on key issues of biodiversity and ecosystem functions, their degrading state and consequences on their essential role in climate regulation or potential as the basis for climate change mitigation and adaptation (UNEP 2011a, b).1.5.2. Similarly there is confusion between the relationships between GHG emissions, climate change and food security (i.e. risks to productivity from impacts, nitrous oxide and methane emissions from agriculture) and ecosystem services.1.6.&#xa0;&#xa0; Uncertainty in climate change model projections may be translated into perceptions of uncertainty as to its existence.1.6.1. People are increasingly reporting a feeling of being swamped with information, and this will necessarily constrain their ability to process any new information.1.6.2. The release of the UKCP09 probabilistic projections had limited success in helping inform the public about the range of possible changes.&#xa0;Climate change related to energy:2.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; Environmental NGOs and other third sector actors are the most trusted sources of influence in relation to energy saving (GILDED European Policy Brief 4). This is followed by the media, Authorities (e.g. Government energy departments) and friends, which are ahead of central government and local government, with EU politicians and authorities coming last. 2.1.1. This suggest that government, advisers and scientists should concentrate on building the existing consensus, that current resource use is unsustainable, rather than attempting to convince the public of the scientific view on climate change.2.1.2. The GILDED project provides evidence that individuals show a preference for a lead to be taken by government (at EU, National and local levels) through allowing public bodies and stakeholder partnerships to demonstrate the benefits of action across different sectors, such as infrastructure, transport and energy planning. 2.1.3. International policy (e.g. EU) should enable national governments and industry leaders to implement tangible GHG reduction practices alongside policies focused at other levels (Nijnik and Bizikova, 2008), (e.g. household, individual) in order to engender a sense of shared responsibility for action. 2.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; Evidence suggests that policymakers and local authorities have a role to play in drawing attention to business models that demonstrate continued profits as a result of responding to climate change policies, such as reducing GHG emissions. 2.2.1. Policy incentives that encourage business leadership are required to build public acceptance of the need to adopt more climate friendly lifestyles. In environments where public funding might be scarce such policies may be the main drivers for achieving overall policy goals relating to addressing climate change. 2.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; Information and advice on climate change policy needs to be clear, consistent and linked to feedback on the impact that collective action is making. Such information needs to relate primarily to tangible goals and behaviours, such as reducing energy or increasing recycling, which are easier for people to relate to than more abstract concepts relating to climate change in general.&#xa0;3.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; In developing communication approaches to improve public understanding of climate change leading to positive behavioural responses, it is necessary to understand the range and variability of individuals and communities, the motivations that influence them and how they react to information.3.1.1. Communication of uncertainty should address the range of possible variability and how this might affect people.3.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; Whilst policy and market forces are the primary drivers of behaviour change, social norms and relationships with peers and friends within communities do influence decision-making and uptake of new behaviours.3.2.1. Environmental values can be developed from an early age via family, peers, formal and informal education, media including television, books, newspapers, magazines and new social media: the internet, social networking, blogs etc.3.2.2. While knowledge on its own is not usually sufficient to drive behaviour change, educational policy that promotes an understanding of the science underlying environment issues means that individuals are better equipped to make future decisions to adopt pro-environmental behaviours.3.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; Stakeholders who mediate between individuals and their communities and regional authorities are recognised as key to building partnerships and networks necessary for coordinated policy implementation.3.3.1. Such third sector actors (NGOs, community development groups etc.), can be powerful stakeholders because they mediate between households and those implementing policy at different levels and therefore have considerable leverage on the degree to which policies can influence behaviour. 3.3.2. Public and private bodies need to continue efforts to engage in network building, showcasing examples of good practice, and these should improve the transmission of information and skills (Bizikova et al., 2012). This includes identification of local stakeholders who may become drivers of energy saving and awareness raising, and whose economic interests and moral commitments are associated with energy saving and use of renewable sources.3.4.&#xa0;&#xa0; Surveys of climate change issues may be problematic in that there is heterogeneity in responses due to motivation and ability to process information in decision strategies (Fischer and Glenk 2011).3.5.&#xa0;&#xa0; Climate scepticism may be particularly common amongst older people from lower socio-economic backgrounds who are conservative and hold traditional values (Tradition, Conformity, Security). In contrast, climate scepticism was less common among younger people from higher socio-economic backgrounds who hold self-transcendence (Universalism, Benevolence) and environmental values. Whilst those non-sceptical of climate change showed attitudinal certainty, those sceptical of climate change did not, suggesting that people who are sceptical might be easily convinced of its true nature. This in turn suggests that public understanding of climate change might be improved by concentrating on changing the attitudes of sceptics (Poortinga et al 2011).3.6.&#xa0;&#xa0; The media (traditional and new social), along with scientists and other stakeholders (including teachers and education professionals), can play a positive role in assisting with information exchange between different levels, building networks of activists and transferring skills and knowledge.3.6.1. But this can be reversed or distorted if powerful sceptics influence these media types.3.7.&#xa0;&#xa0; Public understanding could be improved by presenting the public with consistent and accurate messages about what climate change is. Corner et al (2012) found that attitudes towards climate change became significantly more sceptical after reading newspaper editorials that made opposing claims about the reality and seriousness of climate change. 3.7.1. A key issue here is the media presenting representative coverage on climate change issues (informed by scientific consensus) rather than giving equal weighting to opposing (polarised) views.3.8.&#xa0;&#xa0; Forms of communication and message content needs to be tailored to target audiences.3.8.1. The use of case studies putting impacts and consequences in terms that people can place into the contexts of their own daily lives, i.e. reduced crop yields leading to shortages and price increases.3.8.2. Media can reduce the perception of isolation of the problem: that individuals acting alone will not be significant.&#xa0;The James Hutton Institute research suggests that public understanding of climate change is very important in developing effective policies:4.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; There is a key role for participatory partnerships in developing viable recommendation for policy development (Aquarius 2011).4.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; Evidence from the GILDED FP7 European project, which looked at individuals’ lifestyle choices and understandings of energy issues, notes that people find climate change itself an abstract idea that is not sufficiently tangible in relation to everyday life and making decisions about behaviour choices. Ideas about more concrete actions, such as waste and energy usage, are more easily understood and as a result more ‘actionable’. 4.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; Different groups within society respond more or less favourable to different policy types, depending on their values and beliefs. Policies and regulation should therefore be perceived as generally equitable and not favouring one group in society over another – most people will not take actions for the common good if others are seen to benefit without cost to themselves. 4.4.&#xa0;&#xa0; Example from climate related flood risk research: The results of a Scotland-wide survey showed that there was considerable support among the Scottish public for investments into measures to adapt to floods and low flows in Scotland. Participants’ perceptions of the potential threat of flooding and low flows and the different policy options informed attitudes and willingness to pay for policy measures (Glenk and Fischer 2010).4.5.&#xa0;&#xa0; Policies requiring little or no personal sacrifice are more likely to be adopted than those requiring individual behaviour change. Politicians seem unwilling to make unilateral changes that they perceive will be unpopular with electorates, but the GILDED study suggests that within households people would like to see increased leadership and solid arguments from those in a position to shift policy away from the current carbon intensive society. 4.6.&#xa0;&#xa0; The level of importance is likely to be different between mitigation and adaptation based policies.4.7.&#xa0;&#xa0; Evidence from the FarmPath project (Sutherland et al. 2012) suggests that farmers will adopt renewable energy production as an instrumental response to enhancing profit, rather than an altruistic response to climate change.&#xa0;From wider research areas:4.8.&#xa0;&#xa0; Public understanding of climate change appears vital in developing effective climate change policy. Bord et al. (2000) found that the key determinant of behavioural intentions to address climate change was a correct understanding of the causes of climate change. 4.9.&#xa0;&#xa0; Lorenzoni et al (2007) concluded that one of the main barriers to people engaging with climate change is a lack of knowledge about its causes and consequences [including scale dependence see 4.8.1], as well as understanding of the potential solutions. They also concluded that uncertainty and scepticism about the causes of climate change, its seriousness, and both the necessity and effectiveness of actions to mitigate climate change, are another main barrier to public engagement.4.9.1. As an example of specific relationships in causes and consequences that are significant but receive little public attention, The James Hutton Institute and collaborators research exploring the role of soil microbial communities in driving N2O emissions from arable systems suggests that fungi are important (Herold et al 2012), explain why it has been difficult to link microbial population dynamics with emissions in soil (Giles et al 2012) and demonstrates variation in emission from soil supporting different barley cultivars which may provide a route to mitigation through breeding (Daniell et al unpublished).&#xa0;5.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; People who have a poor understanding of climate change, or who do not accept that anthropogenic climate change is happening, are less likely to be persuaded by scientific or technical arguments to change their behaviour.5.1.1. There is therefore a need for improved communication and to set climate change policies that aim to change behaviour in the context of more tangible environmental issues, such as energy efficiency to reduce rising fuel costs. For example, developing more energy-efficient technologies and switching to renewable energy sources are the most favoured approaches for people with pro-environmental and altruistic values, while cost-saving is more effective for people with hedonistic and egoistic values. 5.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; Research suggests that the range of attitudes, beliefs and values among the public must be taken in to account by policy makers and civil society actors in drawing up climate change policy, by targeting different messages to different segments of the population. 5.2.1. Thus for those with altruistic and environmental values respond better to policies with an emphasis on personal responsibility, while those with egoistic or hedonistic values respond more positively to policies which have an element of cost saving. For those in-between, messages stressing the need for sustainable resource use and the government’s own commitment and initiatives may strengthen their orientation toward altruistic and environmental values.&#xa0;Whilst there may be sufficient evidence in the broad range of scientific literature and research expertise in social and behavioural sciences within the UK (and drawing on wider international capabilities) to support the capacity of the government, the challenges lie in integrating these across a broader range of science disciplines in order to develop coherent and consistent messages to the public and consequential development of relevant policies. &#xa0;To achieve this integration of science disciplines places a large emphasis on within-government communication and collaboration across Departments. There is a need to better understand the consequences and trade-offs of proposed policies across a broad range of science areas (social, behavioural, environmental). Again, this requires inter-disciplinary research. The expertise within government to handle such levels of inter-disciplinarity is currently not well developed. &#xa0;6.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; Government Departments and policy development teams can benefit greatly from the inclusion of non-obvious people (internal and external) in the team, to act as cross-disciplinary facilitators.6.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; Being mindful of, and acknowledging the importance of, such connections can be useful in terms of designing strategies for formulating effective policy.6.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; Use of consistent messages and language across Departments is vital.6.4.&#xa0;&#xa0; Within the Scottish Government (RESAS) there is a drive for inter-disciplinary co-constructed research through more joint policy focussed projects between social and physical scientists.6.5.&#xa0;&#xa0; The Cabinet Office Behavioural Insights Team works across Departments and is seen as a good example of inter-disciplinary collaboration and has produced useful documents, i.e. ‘Behaviour Change and Energy Use’ (Cabinet Office Behavioural Insights Team 2012).6.6.&#xa0;&#xa0; However, care is needed as there may be a tendency for review-based-evidence documents to take on a life of their own, which is potentially unhelpful when it comes to formulating recommendations for a specific policy.  Additional academic expertise is often needed to ensure that what might be called headline-theory within such documents is not translated into policy without being adequately scrutinised.&#xa0;7.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; Yes, valuable lessons can be learned from the experiences of other countries (Nijnik and Bizikova, 2008). e.g. a study analysing the cases  of Germany, Finland, the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada shows that these ‘early adapters’ (Bizikova et al., 2012) have an improved regional and national understanding of climatic impacts, and of the risks to agriculture before the initiation of the planning process. 7.1.1. The interplay between bottom-up and top-down initiatives was crucial in the development of adaptation strategies. The former has provided rich and robust participation in designing, implementing and monitoring adaptations, while the latter was important for prioritizing and legitimizing the development of strategy. It also provided access to high-level decision-makers and funding. 7.1.2. The results suggest that fostering cross-sectorial collaboration, especially by focusing on broader questions such as the role of agriculture in society, has become an important part of adaptation planning. 7.1.3. Results stress that adaptation could be enhanced by skills development and mutual learning across stakeholder groups, research and policy-makers, and through the on-going interactive development of institutional capabilities. &#xa0;The challenge will be in understanding the relevant specific details per country (historical and cultural, political economy, climate, resources available etc.) and putting these into a UK context:7.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; Different countries have different cultures, laws, service infrastructures (e.g. options for heating, transportation and food), climates and available resources (COST Action 2009). 7.2.1. It is therefore relevant to link and coordinate research across countries to identify lessons about public engagement with climate change policy within different governance arrangements. This will enable evidence to show which policies work best overall, and where more specific approaches might be required. For example, there may be important differences between previous Soviet-influenced and capitalist European economies, or between developed and developing countries. 7.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; European research across different countries shows that across all countries (in the GILDED study the Czech Republic, Netherlands, Scotland, Hungary and Germany) people think that climate change is a serious problem. However, in some countries people were more sceptical (thinking that climate change is exaggerated) than in others.&#xa0;7.4.&#xa0;&#xa0; Examples:7.4.1. Australia: has an Emissions Trading Scheme linked to the ‘Carbon Farming Initiative’ to facilitate up-take of good farming practice to reduce GHG emissions and sequest carbon. The issue of carbon offsetting and trading has been analysed also with its relevance to the UK (Nijnik et al. 2011).7.4.2. Costa Rica: government supports a range of Payment for Ecosystem Services schemes to support good environmental management for multiple benefits including carbon sequestration. However, the majority of PES schemes in Latin America (77%) set the payment levels from top-down decisions rather than from bottom-up stakeholder consultation, which can be problematic since opportunity costs (of sellers) and willingness to pay (of buyers) might need to be met (Martin-Ortega et al. 2012).&#xa0;
