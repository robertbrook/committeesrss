default Rugby, as a central organization, and its clubs, individually, are actively encouraging women and girls to participate in the sport
default (see 
defaultbox 
defaultbelow)
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCore to this is 
defaultPremiership Rugby’s defaultPLAY defaultcampaigndefault, launched in May 2013, to support the growth of the game by providing opportunities to Participate, Develop and Excel in Rugby Union. 
defaultI
defaultn addition to national community based outreach and online 
defaultactivities;
default 
defaultPLAY 
defaultis implemented atthe grassroots level throug
defaulth curricular, after-school, club and team-based programmes. The 
defaultPLAY 
defaultcampaign will be prominent at Aviva Premiership Rugby club events 
defaultand match days as well as during Premiership Rugby’s key calendar events, including the Aviva Premiership Rugby Final and
default London Double Header. 
defaultOur players and coaches throughout the year support the initiative
default.
defaultPremiership Rugby with its partners is hoping to create more than 260,000 opportunities to participate, helping grow the game and increasing health and wellness thro
defaultugh 
defaultPLAY of which we would anticipate that 
default40
default% 
defaultwould
default be women or young girls. 
defaultIn addition, professional rugby union clubs are highly active in using their assets to 
defaultaddress other social issues 
default(crime, truancy, literacy and healthy eating) among disadvantaged communities (some of whom will be female). 
default&#xa0;
defaultOne example, of this would be the highly praised Hitz scheme (see defaulthttp://www.hitzrugby.comdefault), which is rudefaultn in conjunction with the Metropolitan Police, where 90% of regular participants reportdefaulteddefault an improvement in their mental or physical health as a consequence of the scheme. default&#xa0;defaultWOMEN AND RUGBY UNION: CASE STUDIES     default&#xa0;

default Rugby would highlight a number of specific areas where clubs are active in encouraging girls and young women into the sport or using the sport to help women.

defaultSchool Age 
defaultThe

defaultnion as part of the 
defaultschool’s
default sports curriculum in primary schools across England in and around Premiership Clubs. We estimate that 39,000 school children 
defaultparticipate in the scheme. Entry is gender blind and we estimate that approximately 40% of the partici
defaultpants each year are girls.
default 
defaultOver 75% of 
defaultparticipating 
defaultteachers saw an improvement in

defaultCoaching 
defaultThe

defaultP
defaultrogramme is designed to ensure that teachers in participating 
defaultschools are able to coach the sport more effectively.
default1200 female teachers are introduced and coached in delivering rugby union sports programming each yeardefault. 
defaultThis is critical because our experience shows that where female teachers or role models are involve
defaultd programmes generate higher levels of participation and retention.

defaultSomething to Chew on 
defaultThis health

defaultWorcester Warriors 
defaultWomen’s
default Touch League 
defaultWomen in the area who wished to play rugby 
default(
defaultesp.
default Touch) 
defaultwere struggling to find coaches, teams to play and facilities. Warriors, a Premiership Club, help initiate
default meetings between various 
defaultparties, which
default led to the formation of the 
defaultMidland Ladies Touch League (2010/11). 
defaultWith the support of the club a league of 10 teams now exists and these teams are beginning to work in local schools to attract other women into the 
defaultgame. 
defaultBarriers 
defaultsuch as l

default, 
defaultknowledge of 
defaultthe game and awareness that other women were interested and available to play are beginning to be overcome. In fact, the club is now working with local people to see if a multi-sex Touch Lea
defaultgue or Tournament might increase local participation (this format is successful in Australia and New Zealand).
