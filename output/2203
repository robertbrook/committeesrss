[normal]ip
[normal] Rugby, as a central organization, and its clubs, individually, are actively encouraging women and girls to participate in the sport
[normal] (see 
[normal]box 
[normal]below)
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Core to this is 
[normal]Premiership Rugby’s [bold]PLAY [bold]campaign[bold], launched in May 2013, to support the growth of the game by providing opportunities to Participate, Develop and Excel in Rugby Union. 
[normal]I
[normal]n addition to national community based outreach and online 
[normal]activities;
[normal] 
[normal]PLAY 
[normal]is implemented atthe grassroots level throug
[normal]h curricular, after-school, club and team-based programmes. The 
[normal]PLAY 
[normal]campaign will be prominent at Aviva Premiership Rugby club events 
[normal]and match days as well as during Premiership Rugby’s key calendar events, including the Aviva Premiership Rugby Final and
[normal] London Double Header. 
[normal]Our players and coaches throughout the year support the initiative
[normal].
[normal]Premiership Rugby with its partners is hoping to create more than 260,000 opportunities to participate, helping grow the game and increasing health and wellness thro
[normal]ugh 
[normal]PLAY of which we would anticipate that 
[normal]40
[normal]% 
[normal]would
[normal] be women or young girls. 
[normal]In addition, professional rugby union clubs are highly active in using their assets to 
[normal]address other social issues 
[normal](crime, truancy, literacy and healthy eating) among disadvantaged communities (some of whom will be female). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]One example, of this would be the highly praised Hitz scheme (see [bold]http://www.hitzrugby.com[bold]), which is ru[bold]n in conjunction with the Metropolitan Police, where 90% of regular participants report[bold]ed[bold] an improvement in their mental or physical health as a consequence of the scheme.

[normal] Rugby would highlight a number of specific areas where clubs are active in encouraging girls and young women into the sport or using the sport to help women.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]School Age 
[normal]The 
[normal]Aviva[bold] Premiership Rugby[bold] Schools [bold]P[bold]rogramme[bold] is a £2m investment in using rugby u
[normal]nion as part of the 
[normal]school’s
[normal] sports curriculum in primary schools across England in and around Premiership Clubs. We estimate that 39,000 school children 
[normal]participate in the scheme. Entry is gender blind and we estimate that approximately 40% of the partici
[normal]pants each year are girls.
[normal] 
[normal]Over 75% of 
[normal]participating 
[normal]teachers saw an improvement in 
[normal]their 
[normal]students
[normal]’
[normal] at
[normal]t
[normal]itudes to exercise after the programme. 
[normal] 
[normal]Coaching 
[normal]The 
[normal]Aviva [bold]Premiership Rugby [bold]Schools[bold] 
[normal]P
[normal]rogramme is designed to ensure that teachers in participating 
[normal]schools are able to coach the sport more effectively.
[normal]1200 female teachers are introduced and coached in delivering rugby union sports programming each year[bold]. 
[normal]This is critical because our experience shows that where female teachers or role models are involve
[normal]d programmes generate higher levels of participation and retention. 
[normal] 
[normal]Something to Chew on 
[normal]This health
[normal]y
[normal] eating campaign has seen dramatic results among boys and girls with:
[normal]- 60.8% of pupils exercising more frequently post scheme 
[normal]- 65.2% of participatin
[normal]g schools have seen children join clubs
[normal]Worcester Warriors 
[normal]Women’s
[normal] Touch League 
[normal]Women in the area who wished to play rugby 
[normal](
[normal]esp.
[normal] Touch) 
[normal]were struggling to find coaches, teams to play and facilities. Warriors, a Premiership Club, help initiate
[normal] meetings between various 
[normal]parties, which
[normal] led to the formation of the 
[normal]Midland Ladies Touch League (2010/11). 
[normal]With the support of the club a league of 10 teams now exists and these teams are beginning to work in local schools to attract other women into the 
[normal]game. 
[normal]Barriers 
[normal]such as l
[normal]ack of childcare, 
[normal]free 
[normal]time
[normal], 
[normal]knowledge of 
[normal]the game and awareness that other women were interested and available to play are beginning to be overcome. In fact, the club is now working with local people to see if a multi-sex Touch Lea
[normal]gue or Tournament might increase local participation (this format is successful in Australia and New Zealand).
