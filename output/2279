EIS 16
[normal]Written evidence submitted by the Crown Estate[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Crown Estate welcomes the opportunity to 
[normal]respond to this 
[normal]inquiry
[normal] on the 
[normal]extractive industries sector
[normal]. 
[normal]The statements contained in this 
[normal]response
[normal] are
[normal] grounded
[normal] in The Crown Estate’s 
[normal]interests, land ownership and as largest minerals landlord of the UK
[normal]. 
[normal]The Crown Estate is a 
[normal]commercially-run, 
[normal]total return
[normal],
[normal] active asset management business
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]oversee
[normal]ing
[normal] 
[normal]a UK-wide
[normal] portfolio of
[normal] prime urban, rural
[normal], coastal
[normal] and 
[normal]offshore 
[normal]property. In line with our core values, we actively manage these to deliver a c
[normal]ommercial return, which is paid each year to the Treasury for the benefit of the nation. We 
[normal]are committed to 
[normal]careful 
[normal]stewa
[normal]rdship of the assets we have been trusted to manage.
[normal] 
[normal]The Crown Estate is g
[normal]ov
[normal]erned by an Act of Parliament, T
[normal]he Crown Estate Act 1961
[normal]. I
[normal]t has a public remit whilst at the same time being independent from Government – a statutory corporation
[normal],
[normal] run on a comme
[normal]rcial basis.
[normal] 
[normal]We are committed to working with government departments, stakeholders and industry in helping to manage the coastal and marine environment
[normal], in line with our commercial remit
[normal].
[normal]Our rural and marine assets 
[normal]comprise
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]As with Mines Royal, we are not involved in the physical process of mining, but we license 
[normal]such activity. In recent years we have invested in new operations with the purchase of mineral interests at Cauldon Low in Staffordshire and Nether Murthat in Scotland.
[normal] Our responsibility for Mines Royal determines the need for o
[normal]ur permission to remove Cro
[normal]wn gold in any form. We currently have four Mines Royal production leases, including one active gold mine in Northern Ireland.
[normal]With these interests combined, this makes The Crown Estate the largest minerals landlord in the UK. 
[normal]It is important to be clear t
[normal]hat The Crown Estate has no rights over UK hydrocarbons, such as Shale Gas, which accrue to ‘the Crown’ but are vested in the Department for Energy and Climate Change. In this context we are no different to any other landowner. 
[normal]Having reviewed the 
[normal]questio
[normal]ns posed in the 
[normal]inquiry
[normal], 
[normal]we have addressed 
[normal]only 
[normal]some 
[normal]of the 
[normal]specific 
[normal]questions 
[normal]with
[normal] relevance to our role
[normal]. We believe other organisations such as the Minerals Producers Association
[normal] (MPA)
[normal] and CBI Minerals Group are best placed to comment in other areas.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Qu[bold]estion [bold]1[bold]:[bold]  What is the contribution to the UK economy of extractive industries in the UK?[bold]It is important at the outset to recognise the 
[normal]role
[normal] and impact
[normal] that terrestrial planning policy has on 
[normal]marine minerals
[normal]. This is particularly true in areas where 
[normal]land 
[normal]based
[normal] minerals are under local 
[normal]planning pressures
[normal] which restricts supply
[normal],
[normal] allowing m
[normal]arine minerals
[normal] a greater market share.
[normal] 
[normal]It is therefore very important to e
[normal]nsu
[normal]re
[normal] 
[normal]that terrestrial 
[normal]planning policy specifically references consideration of marine 
[normal]minerals as
[normal] way of
[normal] maximising the potential of this indigenous resource.
[normal]W
[normal]hilst minerals guidance is set out under the National Planning Policy Framework, with local aggregates assessments undertaken by Local Authorities, consideration of other sources, such as marin
[normal]e minerals (which are outside of 
[normal]the 
[normal]spatial demarcation
[normal] of a Local Authority)
[normal] is needed as part of broader supply chain considerations. 
[normal]C
[normal]lear policy guidance 
[normal]ensuring 
[normal]that 
[normal]marine minerals
[normal] contribution continues
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]in the context of UK supply of minerals, 
[normal]th
[normal]is 
[normal]will
[normal] maximise 
[normal]the overall
[normal] benefit
[normal] to the UK economy
[normal].
[normal]A robust regulatory regime exists
[normal] for marine aggregates
[normal], which is managed through the Marin
[normal]e
[normal] Management Organisation
[normal] 
[normal](MMO) 
[normal](England)
[normal] and
[normal] Natural Resources Wales (Wales)
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] There is currently no extraction in Scottish or Northern Irish waters.
[normal] Operating businesses in this sector have a significant capital asset base to maintain, requiring security of mineral reserves
[normal], and it is 
[normal]important that the 
[normal]Marine Licence 
[normal]application p
[normal]rocedure
[normal] recognises the long term nature 
[normal]and scale 
[normal]of the associated investment profile
[normal] without 
[normal]introducing an excessive burden on the 
[normal]industry
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]The Crown Estate has introduced a procedure designed to optimise the use of the seabed whilst working within 
[normal]the guidelines introduced by the marine planning process that is currently being developed by the MMO. This procedure is also designed to provide a safeguarding protocol for key resources.
[normal]The 
[normal]MPA
[normal] recently commissioned 
[normal]a study
[normal] to assess the contribution the mineral products sector (pr
[normal]incipally minerals extracted to
[normal] supply the 
[normal]construction sector) makes to 
[normal]the UK economy
[normal] and would be able to provide conclusions outlining the Gross Value Added (GVA) contribution the sector makes 
[normal]to the UK economy.
[normal]Alongside the economic contribution minerals production makes to the UK, it is also important to recognise the need for 
[normal]a 
[normal]secure supply
[normal] of minerals for the construction industry
[normal].
[normal] Millions of tons of marine sand and gravel are used across the construction industry and for coastal management and land reclamation each year. 
[normal]The Crown Estate licens
[normal]es nearly all marine seabed sand and gravel resourc
[normal]es lying offshore around the UK
[normal];
[normal] and
[normal] has 
[normal]been licensing the activity 
[normal]for 
[normal]over 50 years
[normal]. 
[normal]Extraction of about 20 million tonnes p
[normal]er 
[normal]a
[normal]nnum
[normal] of marine aggregates 
[normal]occurs 
[normal]off the
[normal] coast of England and Wales.
[normal]As set out in the Marine Policy Statement
[normal] for the UK, m
[normal]arine mineral from UK seabed is v
[normal]iew
[normal]ed as a world class resource.
[normal] It is an important source for security of supply and there is always the potential opportunity to export our dredged materials to other countries in Europe
[normal].
[normal]As we adapt to cl
[normal]imate change, large volumes of 
[normal]marine sand and grave
[normal]ls are used in beach replenishment schemes. Aggregates are pumped directly from dredgers onto beaches,
[normal] providing coastal protection, 
[normal]e
[normal]nhancing the amenity value and 
[normal]providing security to the local economy, for example on the coast of Lincolnshire.
[normal]In addit
[normal]ion, marine sands are used in land reclamation schemes, infilli
[normal]ng areas in ports and harbours 
[normal]to reclaim land from the sea. Recent examples of reclamation include the runway extension at Ronaldsway airport on The Isle of Man and the London Gateway port dev
[normal]elopment
[normal]. 
[normal]It is important to note here that sourcing of marine based minerals ensure that the schemes undertaken are 
[normal]economically viable 
[normal]and it is likely that without these vital resource
[normal]s
[normal],
[normal] this would not be the case. 
[normal]Marine sourced mineral is unique in te
[normal]rms of the ability to import and place large quantities of mineral in a short space of time without the need for importation by road.
[normal] 
[normal]The Crown Estate is 
[normal]also 
[normal]responsible for leasing extraction of minerals lying below the UK sea bed, including deposits of
[normal] potash.
[normal] 
[normal]Potash is a generic term for a variety of potassium bearing minerals; in part
[normal]icular it is Sylvinite that is
[normal] currently
[normal] 
[normal]mined in the UK. Around 90 per cent of UK potash is used in the production of fertiliser with the remainder being used in the che
[normal]mical 
[normal]and pharmaceutical industries. 
[normal]Approximately 60 per cent of all UK production is exported each year.
[normal] 
[normal]The Boulby potash mine, situated on the North Yorkshire coast, is the UK's only commercial potash mine and the most important non-hydrocarbon minera
[normal]l operation in Britain. The mine, which started production in 1973 and is currently managed by Cleveland Potash Ltd, employs 
[normal]around
[normal] 
[normal]1100 workers (another 200 workers 
[normal]have been recruited 
[normal]this year, some of 
[normal]which
[normal] have come from closed coal mi
[normal]nes). Mining ope
[normal]rations extend 
[normal]aro
[normal]und 8 km offshore and 
[normal]the mine
[normal] is the s
[normal]econd deepest in Europe (approx
[normal]imately
[normal] 1km below sea level).
[normal]Boulby mine
[normal] produces in the order of 3 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) potash ore and refines this into 1mtpa potash mainly used in the fe
[normal]r
[normal]tiliser industry. Although the c
[normal]ompany produces enough potash to satisfy the UK demand, 
[normal]they supply about half of the UK
[normal] market with the remainder being imported from 
[normal]overseas
[normal].  
[normal]The
[normal] rock salt
[normal] also mined
[normal] 
[normal](in order to access the potash ore) is mostly sold t
[normal]o Local A
[normal]uthorities and
[normal] the Highway A
[normal]uthorities
[normal] (with 
[normal]produc
[normal]tion in the order of
[normal] about 0.8 mtpa
[normal])
[normal] as de-icing salt
[normal] for roads
[normal]. 
[normal]The Company contributes £225M per year of economic activity as measured by product sales.  They support many local small suppliers
[normal] and service companies.  Half their sales are overseas with approximate foreign earnings of £100M per year.
[normal]During 2011, York Potash 
[normal]signed an agreement with us for the rights to explore f
[normal]or polyhalite under the seabed 
[normal]to the south of Boulby and exploratio
[normal]n is underway. 
[normal]York Potash has determined 
[normal]the existence of considerable reserves
[normal] both under the land and under the seabed, and is in the process of carrying out resear
[normal]c
[normal]h to support an 
[normal]application to
[normal] 
[normal]North York Moors National Park 
[normal]for land based mining oper
[normal]ations and associated surface workings
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]A decision is expected in 2014
[normal]. 
[normal]The MMO has already 
[normal]granted
[normal] 
[normal]permission for the offshore element.
[normal]Question [bold]2[bold]:[bold]  How do the UK-based extractive industries support employment a) in the UK and b) for UK citizens overseas?[bold]Whilst The Crown Estate has previously commissioned and published work related to the analysis of socio economic indicators of marine related activ
[normal]ities in the UK economy (ISBN978-1-906410-01-8), 
[normal]the MPA have information available regarding the role the extractive industries more broadly play in supporting employment
[normal], as highlighted in our response to question 1
[normal]. 
[normal]We estimate that t
[normal]here are approximat
[normal]ely 3,000 people 
[normal]directly 
[normal]employed in the extraction
[normal] and processing
[normal] of marine minerals (
[normal]marine 
[normal]aggregates and potash)
[normal], with many more jobs involved indirectly through downstream and upstream activities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question [bold]6[bold]:[bold]  Is there sufficient engagement between [bold]UK extractive industries and the NGO sector? Are there examples of best practice in engagement between the extractive industries and NGOs?[bold]The Crown Estate has sought to 
[normal]further develop 
[normal]our relationship
[normal]s
[normal] with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) with resp
[normal]ect to the activities that we lease and license. We feel that as our role has become more proactive in the development of our portfolios of activities and management of 
[normal]the 
[normal]estate, so too has the improvement in the relationship with relevant NGOs.
[normal]The Crow
[normal]n Estate funds and supports the Seabed Users and Developers Group (SUDG). The SUDG is an informal grouping of industry sectors whose participants have a common interest in sustainable development within the UK’s marine environment. The Crown Estate works w
[normal]ith SUDG to align seabed user groups across the UK to work positively with Government to prepare shared understanding and approaches to marine management. Organisations involved include sectors whose members require marine licenses for construction and ope
[normal]ration include British Ports Association, United Kingdom Major Ports Association, British Marine Aggregates Producers Association
[normal] (the minerals trade association)
[normal], British Marine Federation, Oil &amp; Gas UK, Renewable Energy Association, Renewable UK, Subsea 
[normal]Cables UK and Carbon Capture and Storage Association. 
[normal]In October 2012, SUDG published a joint statement
[normal] with 
[normal]the Marine Conservation Society, RSPB, The Wildlife Trusts and WWF to work collaboratively on marine conservation in relation to seabed uses. 
[normal]The
[normal] SUDG positively engages with environmental NGOs through this forum.
[normal]The Crown Estate also works very closely with BMAPA to develop best practice and enhance knowledge and understanding of the sector. 
[normal]We have commissioned studies in a number of areas, whic
[normal]h have been published and placed in the public domain. 
[normal]An example of these joint initiatives is “The Area Involved” reports. These are published annually as a result of a March 1999 statement of intent between The Crown Estate and BMAPA committing to revi
[normal]ewing all dredging licences over a rolling five year period. Included was a commitment to surrender areas no longer containing useful resources of sand and gravel and to publish an annual report detailing the extent of dredging within the licensed areas. T
[normal]his year’s report which is to be published shortly is the 15th in the on-going series, and has drawn widespread acknowledgement for the level of information and transparency provided.
[normal]Another example of work undertaken to 
[normal]highlight the sustainable credenti
[normal]als of the marine aggregates sector
[normal] is our involvement in
[normal] developing an industry protocol for the reporting of marine archaeology, and we provide annual analysis of the area of seabed affected by marine mineral extraction. Much of this information is available through our web site (
[normal]http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/energy-infrastructure/research/
[normal]).
[normal]In many of these areas the 
[normal]marine aggregates 
[normal]sector is acknowledged as being a leader amongst the extractive industries and as a consequence
[normal] recognises a significantly improved relationship with many NGOs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question [bold]10[bold]:[bold] What is the competitive landscape for the extractive industries in the 21st Century and is it in the UK’s interest to remain a global centre for them?[bold]The competitive landsca
[normal]pe for the UK building materials industry has altered over the last decade following the acquisition of UK companies by global organisations for whom cement production is a core activity (e.g. – purchase of Hanson by Heidelberg Cement, RMC by Cemex, 
[normal]and Ag
[normal]gregate
[normal] Industries by Holcim).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This industry wide consolidation has led to greater integration of UK and European suppliers and competition for available capital investment. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The low value
[normal] of some minerals (e.g. aggregates) means that local markets remain a feature for 
[normal]most 
[normal]suppliers that do not have the ability to take advantage of rail or sea logistics. Marine minerals are in a position to take advantage of cro
[normal]ss
[normal] border trade, with around
[normal] 
[normal]a third
[normal] 
[normal]of marine aggregates and
[normal] half 
[normal]of potash supplies being exported.
[normal]We trust that you will find these comments 
[normal]helpful and 
[normal]constructive. 
[normal]We would be very willing to provide additional information on any of the points we have raised above
[normal] and be very pleased to discuss these matters with you further
[normal]. 
[normal]Through the 
[normal]Energy &amp; Infrastructure’s 
[normal]Minerals &amp; Infrastructure
[normal] team
[normal], w
[normal]e are ready to engage in further discussions on these and other points relevant to our ownership or which our expertise m
[normal]ay be brought to bear.
[normal] All of this response may be put into the public domain and there is no part of it that should be treated as confidential.
