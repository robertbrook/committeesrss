"&#xa0;\nJustice Committee\nOral evidence:\n \nCrown Dependencies: developments since 2010\n, \nHC \n726\n[\nTuesday\n \n5 November\n 2013\n]\nOrdered by the House of Commons to be published on \n5 November 2013\nWatch th\ne\n meeting\nMembers present: \nRt\n Hon Sir Alan \nBeith\n (Chair); \nSteve Brine, Jeremy \nCorbyn\n, Nick de Bois, Gareth Johnson, and Andy McDonald\nQuestions \n1–42\nWitness\n[\nes\n]\n: \nRt Hon Lord McNally, Minister of State,\n and\n Cathryn Hannah, Head of Crown Dependencies, Overseas Territories and Visits Team, Ministry of Justice\nQ1 &#xa0; \nChair: \nLord McN\nally and\n \nCathryn\n Hannah, welcome to our session this morning. I \nam going to\n do something unusual by saying that\n,\n in our discussions with all the Crown Dependencies\n,\n we have had many favourable reports of the way in which the Ministry of Justice has implemented our previous report and in particular the way in which both\n you,\n Lord McNally\n,\n as Minister\n,\n and you, Ms Hannah, as the civil servant in charge\n,\n have been helpful and co\n&#x2011;\noperative to the Dependencies. \nIt\n does not mean that there are not issues and grievances, but in many fields remarks are not prefaced with friendly tributes to Ministers and civil servants of the kind that we have heard on quite a few occasions. \n \nWhat\n resources are\n the Department devoting to this, bearing in mind that our previous report indicated that you were going to have problems with the resources and\n,\n therefore\n,\n you should trim the activity to fit the resource?\n&#xa0;\nLord McNally: \nCathryn\n runs a very small department. Since 2010 the Ministry of Justice has had to cut back, i\nnitially, in the first spending r\neview by 23%\n, and in a subsequent review\n by 10%. That has meant that we h\nave had to employ a leaner team,\n able\n, \nwe hope\n,\n \nto \ndeliver more for less, but I do not think that there have been pressures on delivery that have affected our performance. I\n do not know whether \nCathryn\n would like to say anything.\nCathryn Hannah: That is \nright. We have tried to \nstreamline our focus on the areas where we, as the Ministry of Justice, demonstrably add value and are the core of the constitutional relationship. That has meant that, as you have noted, the relationships with the Crown Dependencies have improved and at the same time \nso has \nthe quality of the service we \nprovide\n. We have a small team\n,\n but it is a team that works well and is adequately resourced for what we are doing. We also have access to lawyers, some of whom are here today, who work on Crown Dependency issues and are able to provide a quick and efficient service.  \nLord McNally: We took up one of the key recommendations of your 2010 report,\n which was to not make the MO\nJ the solver of every problem and the dealer \nwith\n every issue. We have \nbecome\n very adep\nt at identifying the individual and\n the Department where the solution to a problem is\n,\n directing the Crown Dependency there\n,\n and making sure that the response \nis\n a positive one. Within a few weeks of taking office as the Minister in 2010, the Prime Minister gave me clearance to write to every ministerial lead to say that it was expec\nted that they should have cognis\nance of the problems or issues relating to the Crown Dependencies and \nshould \nbe expecting to give them access. In the main that has worked.\nQ2 &#xa0; \nChair: We will explore that in more detail, but perhaps I could ask what you feel you have done \nwhich\n guarantees that this kind of relationship can continue with future changes of office holder, both ministerial and civil service?\n&#xa0;\nLord McNally: I always emphasise \nthat \nall Ministers are birds of passage and, of course, sometimes lead officials in Departments have other priorities, but I do think that we have set in place contacts and relationships and a template for working\n,\n which anybody following me or following \nCathryn\n will be able to take forward. I have been assiduous in my visits to all the Dependencies. I have made sure that\n,\n when Ministers from the Dependencies have been in \nLondon\n, my door is always open as far as they are concerned. As I said before, we have also put in place with the Cabinet Office a guidance note for Departments on how they should treat the Dependencies. If points have arisen where they seem to be overlooked\n,\n I have intervened either by phoning or writing to Ministers concerned, saying, \n“\nCan I remind you that the Prime Minister has asked that you give this priority\n?”\n Usually, that little nudge has been enough to get the wheels turning.\nQ3 &#xa0; \nJeremy Corbyn: Going back to the point tha\nt Sir Alan raised a moment ago, \nhow are you prioritising constitutional issues over day\n&#x2011;\nto\n&#x2011;\nday issues and how are you going to make sure that continues in the future\n,\n because clearly that is \nyour\n direction of \ntravel \nat the moment?\n&#xa0;\nLord McNally: \nWith regard to t\nhe constitutional issues, such as they are, one of the problems \nwas that\n I discovered \nthat a goodly number of M\nembers of both Houses thought that the Crown Dependencies were colonies a\nnd—\nQ4 &#xa0; \nJeremy Corbyn: It shows the need for constitutional education, does it not?\n&#xa0;\nLord McNally: It certainly does. \nThey thought that I was somehow Governor-\nGeneral and I could issue orders\n,\n and the orders had to be obeyed \nand so on\n. One of the points that I constantly made\n when meeting parliamentary colleagues wa\ns that both the \nKilbrandon\n Report over 50 years ago and this Committee three years ago were very careful in pointing out that our constitutional r\nesponsibilities were supportive; t\nhey were not dictatorial. That I have tried to do. In the main, the constitutional relationship is in good shape and it is a matter of seeing where issues arise in the case of some of the bigger Dependencies, their desire for an international profile, representation at major conferences \nand so on\n. We are looking at that and working with them on that. \nThe other is m\nuch more, as you say, the bread-and-\nbutter\n,\n day\n&#x2011;\nto\n&#x2011;\nday problems of dealing with \nWhitehall\n. Those we try to deal with on a case-by-\ncase basis\n—\nas I say, not getting embroiled a\ns the MOJ\n but using our knowledge of the \nWhitehall\n machine to help the Dependencies to get to the right desk and the right decision maker.\nQ5 &#xa0; \nJeremy Corbyn: Is that working?\n&#xa0;\nLord McNally: I think so. \nSir Alan made the point\n that\n,\n certainly\n,\n the relations we have had over the last three and a half years have been very constructive\n,\n but, \nas with\n all these things, it is like a good marriage; it has to be worked at. It is not a finished product\n; i\nt is work in progress. Therefore, if ever I leave a note for my successor\n,\n it will be to k\neep working at the relationship and\n make sure the lines of communication are open. It is not a fixed\n settlement. It is, as I say, \nwork in progress.\nQ6 &#xa0; \nJeremy Corbyn: \nCathryn\n, do you feel the same on this?\n&#xa0;\nCathryn Hannah: \nAbsolutely. \nOn the constitutional day\n&#x2011;\nto\n&#x2011;\nday business such as the legislation, because now we have established processes in place that we \nhave \nworked very hard to agree with the Crown Dependencies, it is something that is quite stable. For example, there is no backlog of Crown Dependency legislation any more. Legislation is dealt with in an average of 20 working days and usually for the next Privy Council sitting\n, and t\nhat is something that the team and lawyers and Ministers are very keen to continue, so we have that kind of process that works. Because there is no backlog\n,\n it is a lot easier to deal with legi\nslation as and when it comes in. \nBy focusing on what really counts and streamlining the relationship\n,\n we have been able to make progress that is sustainable and will continue.  \nLord McNally: That is the key\n,\n though, Sir Alan. When we came \nin, \nI found that within the Ministry of Justice we had lawyers second\n&#x2011;\nguessing Crown Dependency lawyers. One of the things that has struck me is the very high quality of lawyers and civil servants within the Crown Dependencies. In reality, second\n&#x2011;\nguessing them was paternalistic and unnecessary.\nChair: It\n was an \nexplicit recommendation of ours\n that you should not do that. We will return to the legislative timetable in just a moment.\nQ7 &#xa0; \nAndy McDonald: Could I ask a question about the generic relationship between the \nUK\n and the CDs\n?\n As I understand it\n, your task is twofold:\n on the one hand\n,\n \nit is \nto mediate directly between the \nUK\n and the Crown Dependencies\n,\n and\n,\n \non\n the other\n,\n \nit is to facilitate\n direct c\nontact with other Departments. D\no you think you have the balance of those dual imperatives right?\n&#xa0;Lord McNally: Yes, I think so. When I first thought through what the job entailed\n,\n I did think that part of my job was going to be to make sure that they got the right kind of access to the benefit of both. I appreciate that\n, if a\n Department is working on a mass\nive piece of legislation such as a 180-\nclause Bill dealing with all of the UK or even England and Wales, the priority it gives to how that legislation may affect the Crown Dependencies will not \nbe at the top of their list or\n \nat \nthe top of ministerial lists, but in the Crown Dependencies it is \nat \nthe top of their list\n.\n \nT\nherefore\n,\n it is\n about\n how we get them both together without the Department saying, \n“\nWho are these people? Why are they bothering us?\n”\n, making them understand that part of their key core responsibilit\nies\n is to make sure that that legislation works with the Crown Dependencies and \nhas\n a point of entry early enough in the development of policy to have awareness. \nHas that always worked? No, it has not\n,\n but, as I say, this is why it is work in progress. We have had the odd slip\n—t\nhere was a great deal of concern about value added tax being applied to certain products from the Crown Dependencies with little or no notice\n. It\n is that kind of surprise and shock that I have been trying to iron out of the system. I also see, as well, my responsibility as a candid friend. I have consistently said to the Crown Dependencies that they have to meet their critics\n—and \nthey have their critics\n—\nby running a tight ship, acting with \ntransparency and in accordance with all the rules and regulations of whatever field of endeavour that they are working in. Again, my impression is that that ambition is shared by the Crown Dependencies. I have said consist\nently to them that\n there is no advantage in them pushing the envelope and getting involved in areas of activity \nthat\n \ncause them \nreputational damage.\nQ8 &#xa0; \nAndy McDonald: When we visited the Dependencies\n,\n they felt a little bit hurt at some of the comments that came out of No.\n&#xa0;\n10 and the Treasury about taxation issues. Do you think they were justified in feeling aggrieved?\n&#xa0;\nLord McNally: A little bit. Again, that was an example where we have made rapid p\nrogress. I have worked with No. \n10\n,\n and I know it is highly unlikely that in planning some statement by the Prime Minister someone around the table is going to say, \n“\nIs this going to affect the Crown Dependencies, Prime Minister?\n”\n Somehow we have to build that in. What has been good is that\n,\n since we had a couple of incidences where the Prime Minister was showing you his determination to address financ\nial service regulation globally\n \nand\n the Crown Dependencies thought that they were being unnecessarily fingered, No. 10 and the Treasury have become much more aware and the Chief Ministers of the Crown Dependencies were invited over for discussions. There has been a lot more communication with them about the determination of the Government to address weaknesses in global governance of the financial sector. \nI have also said to them\n—\npushing at an open door\n—\nthat they are now living in a world where the world community is looking at tightening financial regulations and it is in their best interest\ns\n to be part of that process of transparency and accounta\nbility. That is the right thing: w\ne are aware of their concerns\n,\n but they see themselves playing a constructive and positive part in a direction of travel \nto \nwhich all the major countries are now committed in terms of transparency and accountability and financial services.\nQ9 &#xa0; \nAndy McDonald: In the light of \nt\nhe fact that there were those discussions, if these remarks were careless or inaccurate\n,\n do you think that that has damaged the relationship between the UK and the Crown Dependencies\n,\n or has that been overcome by these discussions?\n&#xa0;\nLord McNally: I hope not. The Crown Dependencies have certainly expressed thanks for the way that the Prime Minister has handled recent multinational G8 and G20 meetings. The nature of the relationship is \nthat \nsometimes they will say things or do things that upset us\n,\n and, dealing with \nWhitehall\n, some Department will drop the ball or do something that is high\n&#x2011;\nhanded. What I hope we have established is a basis of trust between us so that if something does happen we can quickly move to repair it without any lasting damage. \nCathryn\n has worked extremely hard at that\n,\n making sure that there have been seminars and workshops with the \nCrown Dependency civil servants\n \nand \ncivil servants coming into \nWhitehall\n to get a better understanding of how \nWhitehall\n works. That is a process that I would like to see continue and develop\n,\n because the more they have civil servants who understand how the \nWhitehall\n machine works the better. Of course, \nif \nWhitehall\n civil servants have somebody \ncome over \nfrom Jersey\n,\n Guernsey or the \nIsle of Man\n, it sticks in their mind that there is that administration with those issues that they have to keep in sight when they are developing policy.\nQ10 &#xa0; \nAndy McDonald: Finally, has anything arisen since the 2010 repor\nt that would cause you to think w\ne need a review of the constitutional relationship, or are we as we were?\n&#xa0;\nLord McNally: No, I do not think so. The constitutional relationship is 800 years old. I was just checking that it was King John\n,\n who usually gets a bad press, who gave the seal to the \nChannel Islands\n relationship. No, it works\n,\n and I believe it is as strong \nas \nor stronger than it ever was. As long as the We\nstminster Government appreciate and understand\n t\nhe nature of that relationship—\nthat they are not colonies and cannot be browbeaten and bullied but have to be t\naken into account and discussed with—\nand as long as they realise that they have responsibilities both to the United Kingdom and the global community in the observance of treaties\n,\n agreements and such, it is a solid relationship and one that I do not see needs any tinkering with in any fundamental way.\nQ11 &#xa0; \nSteve Brine: We \nhave \ntouched on some of this but maybe we can just explore it a bit more\n with \nCathryn\n. \nI\nnitiatives have been undertaken recen\ntly to look at the consultation on\n \nUK\n legislative initiatives and how they affect the Dependencies. Lord McNally, you mentioned people being seconded and we know that somebody was seconded from \nJersey\n to the MO\nJ over the turn of the last year, but what recent initiatives can you expand on for us that have sought to improve the mu\ntual understanding between the D\nependencies and the UK Departments?  I notice there is this legislative checklist, which you would \nthink is a bit of an obvious no-\nbrainer\n,\n bu\nt clearly it has\n been falling down somewhere. \nCould you expand on that?\n&#xa0;\nCathryn Hannah: Sure. The Cabinet Office have their legislative checklist\n—t\nhe most recent one was published in July of this year\n. I\nt is a useful starting point because it shows Departments what their \nobligations\n are to Crown Dependencies in relation to consulting on \nUK\n legislation. That seems to work quite well. There is an obligation, therefore, to show that they have consulted the Crown Dependencies before a bit of legislation can go through Parliament. \nW\ne have tried to help that along by creating \n“\nhow\n&#x2011;\nto\n”\n notes for other Departments that explain what their role is\n,\n how they can perform it and what support they can get both in terms of UK legislation that may affect the Crown Dependencies and also the extension of international instruments. We have had feedback both from the Crown Dependencies and \nfrom Government Departments that t\nhey find that really useful\n.\n \nW\ne are trying\n to\n make it as easy as possible for another Government Department to understand what they need to do and how they need to do it. If it is complicated\n,\n it gets put to the bottom of the pile. If it is easy and it is explained\n,\n it is a lot easier for them to know who to contact. Again, it is about\n building these direct official-to-\nofficial conversations between the Crown Dependencies and the Departments.\nQ12 &#xa0; \nSteve Brine: Jersey\n said it was better than it used to be, which is as good a ringing endorsement as you get with an official term. Anecdotally, from your point of view working \nin\n it, \nh\now often is that step still missed out? Why is it not a lot better than it used to be?\n&#xa0;\nCathryn Hannah: It seems to be a lot better. We do have occasions where, for legacy issues, they are something we have been working on for a long time. Then\n,\n as Lord McNally said, \nthere \nwe are trying to ensure that remedies happen as quickly as possible so\n,\n if a mistake has been made\n,\n you deal with it and make sure that it does not have any lasting damage. A good example of where it has worked well,\n for example, is the Home Office B\nill at the moment on immigration, which obviously \nis being\n done to a tight time\n \nscale. \nT\nhe Home Office officials \nme\nt very early with the Crown Dependencies, explain\ned\n what they are doing, explain\ned\n how it is going to work and explain\ned\n what time\n \nscale they had to engage with the Crown Dependencies, which was tight, but at least the Crown Dependencies knew about it, knew it was coming, \nand \nknew who to engage with. Again, the feedback we had from the Crown Dependencies is they really appreciated\n that kind of direct engagement. S\no we are getting a lot more Departments proactively coming to us \nasking\n how \nthey\n engage with the Crown Dependencies on these things.\nQ13 &#xa0; \nSteve Brine: Maybe this is a\n question for you, Lord McNally. W\nhat scope is there for Ministers when they go into a Department new? Far be it for me to suggest that a Minister is merely reshuffled into his or her new Department without a full knowledge of that Department and what goes on in that Department, but what scope is there for Ministers to be better\n informed on\n that, because\n,\n ultimately\n,\n it is up\n to Ministers to ask civil servants\n ques\ntions as well as the other way \nround, is it not?\n&#xa0;Lord McNally: It is indeed\n,\n but you have described exactly the British system\n.\n  \nSteve Brine: I know\n.\nLord McNally: First of all\n,\n you are briefed, as I was in 2010, about the relationship. I wa\ns probably as ignorant as most M\nembers of Parliament in either House about the precise relationship and the difference between the Crown Dependencies and the \nOverseas\n \nTerritories\n. For the first few weeks I had colleagues in both Houses congratulating me on being able to visit all those tropical islands that we have dotted around the world. I had to explain to them\n,\n no, no, those are overseas territories. The Crown Dependencies are the \nChannel Islands\n and the Isle of Man.\nSteve Brine: New members to this Committee usually ask the Chairman that same question\n.\nLord McNally: \nWhen are we going? \nMy greatest insult to the Isle of Man was when I said to them that they were all right in their relationship with me because I always considered them a little \nbit of Lancashire in the \nIrish s\nea\n. I then got a history lesson on their Viking past and how they had nothing to do with \nLancashire\n.\nChair: I am surprised you have managed to live that down\n.\nLord McNally: Hopefully, any Minister who does follow me wil\nl take the same decision as me: \nthat this is not a peripheral part of their responsibilities\n. It is \na key part\n,\n and I saw it from day one, to try and understand the issues and \nto \ntake bo\nth sides of the job as I saw it.\n \nOne was\n to make sure\n,\n where they were running into problems in dealing with Government, in \nWhitehall\n or \nBrussels\n, that I would try and be a facilitator in making sure that they had access to the right people, to the right Depa\nrtment, at the appropriate time. The second was\n to be the candid friend, to make it \nso \nthat this\n \nwas not a one\n&#x2011;\nway street; if they were going to have good relations with the Westminster Government and with this Parliament\n,\n then they had to show \nthat they were\n aware and alert to their responsibilities in this world community. I have been willing to do that at times to make sure \nthat, \nmostly willingly, they responded to a realisation that in a globalised world you have to be able to play constructively and to guard your representation if you are going to succeed.\nQ14 &#xa0; \nGareth Johnson: C\nould \nI\n ask you a couple of questions surrounding the issue o\nf Royal Assent for legislation?\n I took part in the trip to the \nIsle of Man\n and they were very pleased with the progress that had been made in expediting legislation. \nW\nhat \nis \nthe current timetable that you \nhave for achieving Royal Assent\n and \ndoes it differ\n between the various different Crown Dependencies?\n&#xa0;\nCathryn Hannah: Our part in the process does not differ in terms of the time\n \nscales. As I mentioned earlier, the average is very much that legislation is dealt with within a month and usually for the next Privy Council. What does delay it and where there is a slight difference is the fact that for a lot of Jersey and Guernsey legislation it has to go through the Privy Council time\n scales, which\n are roughly nine a year\n,\n and over the summer and the winter period there can be quite a gap between the Privy Councils, which is one of the reasons we have suggested to Jersey and Guernsey \nthat \nthey might want to look at the Isle of Man model, which is that by prerogative order the Lieutenant\n&#x2011;\nGovernor\n of the Isle of Man can sign off certain legislation that does not affect the constitutional\n relationship for Royal Assent. S\no the \nsame process in the MOJ \nis followed\n,\n but the end part of it is quicker because there is not the delay brought about by Privy Councils. We understand this is something that Jersey and \nGuernsey\n are considering\n,\n but it is ultimately down to them whether they want to take this forward or not.\nQ15 &#xa0; \nAndy McDonald: Moving to that timetable, do you think that there is room for improvement still, even with the Isle of Man system\n,\n which seems to be the most expeditious system of the Crown Dependencies? Do you think there is any room for improvement still further?\n&#xa0;\nCathryn Hannah: In terms of \nour role\n, we have streamlined \nit \nas far as it can go. Our lawyers do need to review the legislation. The Royal Assent memorandums are incredibly useful for them in terms of showing how the legislation is compatible with ECHR requirements and also \nhow it \nfits in with constitutional relationships, which enables an effective review from our lawyers, but that process still needs to happen. As I said, to be honest\n,\n it is fairly quick now anyway. \nM\nost legislation is submitted up to Ministers and so forth\n \nin a matter of weeks, so it is probably as quick as it can be.  \nLord McNally: \nI\nn 2010 there was a backlog\n,\n \nand \nthat was a real\nly\n serious reason for criticism. We have clea\nred the backlog; we have the 20-\nday target\n; and t\nhey are looking at a move to the \nIsle of Man\n procedure, which \nI think \nmakes sense. I would think it worth this Committee looking again in three years\n’\n time\n—\nI would not like to start pulling up the plant to see if the roots are growing too soon. We are on a good trajectory as far as dealing with these matters \nis concerned \nand I do not see any obvious further initiatives\n.\n \nW\ne also have to remember that\n,\n if we \nhad got\n this wrong in terms of \nUK\n terms, in \nWestminster\n terms, you would have the relevant Minister down here immediately to ask why this was not spotted or why we allowed this to go through. It is a mutually dependent relationship and what happens in the Crown Dependencies does splash over into our reputation, so we have a responsibility to make sure that \ntheir legislation passes muster\n but with as light a touch as we possibly can.\nQ16 &#xa0; \nAndy McDonald: It seems it has been quite a success story\n \nthus far. I know when we \nwere speaking with the legislatu\nr\ne\n in the \nIsle of Man\n \nthat \nthey were very frustrated. In the p\nast there had been delays of 12 to \n18 months or so\n, and\n I unde\nrstand that,\n when this Committee previously visited the Isle of Man\n,\n this problem was flagged up to that Committee and recommendations were made to your Department that this be sorted out. It seems as though, \nby \nand large, that has happened. I\nt does\n,\n I suppose\n,\n give an example of \nwhere, \nif there are good communications taking place\n,\n you can actually make sure that there is benefit for all.  \n&#xa0;\nLord McNally: I am not going to be accused of flattering this Committee, which I know is far too mature to be flattered, but\n,\n for students of Government and governance\n,\n the interrelationship between the Department and this Committee is a good case study\n.\n \nY\nour 2010 report set a number of tasks\n,\n which, to answer your question, made it easier for me to know where my priorities should be. If you look at your 2010 report and see where we have addressed our emphasis and work\n,\n it is a good way of working, as far as the Department is concerned, to take a Select Committee report and to go through it in terms of implementation.\nQ17 &#xa0; \nChair: One of the things we did pick up, though, is that sometimes delay occurs in the legislative timetable and it is not clear why the delay is occurring. Bearing in mind past experience of delays \nthat\n have been effectively caused by a bargaining situation, where the UK Government \nare\n not approving legislation because \nthey want\n something else to be agreed to, that experience leads people to wonder what is happening this time. If they are able to pick up the phone and talk to officials it has been much easier to resolve those questions, but is it \nnot\n important to make sure that if there is a reason for delay everybody knows what the reason is?\n&#xa0;\nCathryn Hannah: Absolutely. I hope there are not too many cases where that is not the case. We definitely encourage them. In fact our lawyers\n—Ruth is behind me—are\n in contact with lawyer\ns in the Crown Dependencies and, \nif we do have an issue with \na\n law\n,\n the first step is to pick up the phone to the law offices in the Crown Dependencies and get them to talk through and explain where they are coming from on the law\n. S\no, rather than going through formal letters and e\n&#x2011;\nmails that can take time, it is picking up the\n phone, one official to another or\n one lawyer to another\n,\n to try and resolve an issue.  \nLord McNally: I have to say\n that\n I am not aware of any delay that has been beca\nuse of that kind of bargaining—\ncertainly not in the last three and a half years. I would not support such a way of going about business.\nQ18 &#xa0; \nChair: Would it make much practical difference if Jersey\n,\n Guernsey\n,\n Sark and Alderney moved to the Isle of Man system\n,\n where the Lieutenant\n&#x2011;\nGovernor\n in most cases, as it were, delivers the Assent, or would that be more a difference of perception than reality in the process that has to take place?\n&#xa0;\nCathryn Hannah: It depends. Over the summer it could well. For example, the last Privy Council is in July and, by the time we have organised papers and everything\n,\n you are looking a few weeks before then and then the next one is not until October. If something comes to us at the end of June\n,\n it might not get to a Privy Council until October, whereas\n,\n if you had the option of going to the Lieutenant\n&#x2011;\nGovernor\n,\n the authorities on the island could then prioritise the last part of it in t\nerms of it getting Royal Assent. S\no it could make a difference of a couple of months in the summer period.  \nLord McNally: If Jersey and Guernsey came to us and said, \n“\nWe would like to go over to the \nIsle of Man\n system\n,”\n they would not have any objections at our end. Just instinctively, it sounds like it would work better.\nChair: Turning to another area in which there are delays, Mr de Bois.\nQ19 &#xa0; \nNick de Bois: I just want to touch on the extension of international instruments to Crown Dependencies. Basically, if I am reading what they are saying so far, the Crown Dependencies seem broadly content with the processes for our insular legislation, but for treaty extensions do you first of all accept that there are delays before we examine what they may be?\n&#xa0;\nCathryn Hannah: Yes.\nNick de Bois: Good. Okay, that is easy. That is the shortest answer.\nChair: It is a good short answer. We will stick with that.\nQ20 &#xa0; \nNick de Bois: We will now flatter our witnesses\n.\n One of the reasons I want to explore \nthis \nis \nthat \nthe Ministry of Justice seem to have accepted that the Crown Dependencies are fundamentally capable of carrying out, shall we say, relevant legal scrutiny, but\n,\n it is suggested\n,\n the Foreign Office do not and therefore that is a precursor to delay. Is that a fair assessment?\n&#xa0;\nCathryn Hannah: It is not the Foreign Office so much as the fact that treaties are owned by different Departments, so a treaty on intellectual property would be IPO and BIS. One of the things we are doing at the moment is working with the Crown Dependencies to try and work out what information they need to provide to Departments to make sure it is consistent in terms of their legislation\n—\nit makes them com\npliant with international treaties\n so it can be extended. \nSalma\n in my team ran a workshop over the summer with the Crown Dependencies to look at this issue and work out wh\nat information Departments need and\n how the Crown Dependencies can best give their Departments that information. We are trying to take a very collaborative approach with the Crown Dependencies so that we can agree a process that the Departments will be happy with and \nthat \ngives them that important ability to check that the Crown Dependencies are compliant with an international treaty\n,\n but, equally, does not second\n&#x2011;\nguess and does not end up being a forensic redoing of the work that the law office\ns within the Crown Dependencies have done. \n&#xa0;\nQ21 &#xa0; \nNick de Bois: Is there any chance of an overlap here? It might be something that goes to another Department, another Ministry\n,\n but because it is international does it then have to go through \nthe \nFCO? Do they always want right of oversight because it is international? Is that perhaps where there is\n—\n \nCathryn Hannah: It has to go through \nthe \nFCO to get the formal extension of the treaty, which is part of the process. We are obviously working with the FCO and looking at the whole process, but it will always need to go to the Department\n which\n owns the subject matter to check compliance because they will be the expert in that area.\nQ22 &#xa0; \nNick de Bois: Sorry to press you;\n it is just my understanding. You think that maybe it is other Departments not accepting that they would have had the ability to do the legal scrutiny\n as well as, for example, the MOJ do.\nCathryn Hannah: It is about them understanding what their obligation is and how they can best go about doing the scrutiny. There is an onus on the Crown Dependencies as well to provide the right kind of information to the Department to make it as easy as possible for them to understand how their laws are compliant. As I said, this is something that we are \nworking with the Crown Dependencies on to try and make sure the process is effective and \nwe are \ndoing it in a collaborative way. The feedback we have had thus far from the Crown Dependencies is \nthat \nthey really appreciate that collaborative working to try and resolve the issue, rather than us com\ning up with a solution in the MO\nJ and then\n we foist it on to them.\nQ23 &#xa0; \nNick de Bois: Absolutely, and t\nhat seems very constructive. I understand that \nGuernsey\n have recommended, if you like, presumption of consent to extension of treaties. Their argument is that that will vastly improve the process without, if you like, upsetting any constitutional arrangements. Do you share that view or \nare \nyou working on that view? Is there an acceptance of that?\nCathryn Hannah: The \nUK\n is ultimately responsible for any treaty that is entered into and then extended to the Crown Dependencies\n. S\no we, as the UK Government, need to satisfy ourselves that the Crown Dependency \nconcerned is suitably compliant.\n \nW\ne might not be fully satisfying ourselves \nwith a presumption of consent, \nbut we want to ensure that it is a risk\n-\nbased proportionate response to that compliance check and it is not redoing the work that very competent law officers within the Crown Dependencies have done.  \nLord McNally: There is a point here that what the Crown Dependencies do and how they do it, particularly in the international sphere, carries a reputational risk for the \nUnited Kingdom\n as a whole. Therefore, I suspect that in \nthe \ninternational dimension there will always be a little bit of time delay as opposed to the purely insular legislation that we do. We can do it very quickly in relation to Government Departments and the Crown Dependencies, but this is where I am the candid friend the other way. We, the \nUnited Kingdom\n, have a reputation and responsibilities to safeguard and we will need time to make sure that where the Crown Dependencies are acting on the international stage we will want to\n—\n \nQ24 &#xa0; \nNick de Bois: I totally understand that point and\n where you are coming from. You think that extending this to international instruments, by definition\n,\n is going to have a default delay that the in\nsular legislation won’t have.\n It is just a question of trying to reduce that.  \nLord McNally: That is it exactly\n,\n but, again, judge us by our actions. I positively encouraged them to open an office in \nBrussels\n so that they could keep apace. Indeed, I have encouraged them to open an office in the City of \nLondon\n.\n \nQ25 &#xa0; \nNick de Bois: I think we\n will be coming on to that a little later. \nI have \nj\nust one final\n question. H\nave you given any consideration to granting the same status to the matrix of compliance prepared by law officers in the case for treaty extension to the explanatory memorandum proposed to accompany insular legislation? Again, it is another parallel with the insular legislation.  \nCathryn Hannah: The compliance matrix, like the Royal Assent amendment, is the most important starting point for the Department reviewing the compliance to the treaty. This is why we are working with the Crown Dependencies at the moment\n to make sure we get that right and i\nt has the kind of information the Departments need to make those kinds of decisi\nons so that they are not second-\nguessing\n. S\no, yes, the compliance matrix could be a useful mec\nhanism for that.\nQ26 &#xa0; \nNick de Bois: Will\n it be a dynamic document? I know for years, before I came in\nto this place, compliance matric\nes\n,\n once started\n,\n are great but they can be very poor finishers if they are not adapted and developed. I am sure it is good practice to review that.  \nCathryn Hannah: It cannot be a “one size fits \nall\n”\n because all treaties are very different.\nNick de Bois: Exactly.  \nCathryn Hannah: It is a case of having a rough idea of what needs to be included and that the law officers in the Crown Dependencies feel confident enough to know \nthat what \ninformation they \nput\n in will suit the Department. This, again, comes back to the most important part of this process, which is the engagement between the Crown D\nependency and the Department that\n owns the treaty so \nthat \nthey can have that dialogue and discussion and, also, forewarn Departments that they may wish in a few months\n’\n time to have a \ncertain treaty extended to them,\n they are doing the work on this treaty\n and this is\n what \nthey\n are looking at\n. T\nhat can be factored in as well to the Department\n’\ns resources so that they know in three months\n’\n time \nthat \nthey are going to get this request for an extension of the treaty and they can prepare for it in terms of resources. This is part of the process we are looking at \nat\n the moment to try and make it as useful as possible.\nQ27 &#xa0; \nChair: One\n of the problem areas seems to be bilateral investment treaties where the \nUnited Kingdom\n has ceded competence to the EU under the Lisbon Treaty but the Dependencies have to replace old treaties in those areas. My suspicion is\n—\ntell me if I am wrong\n—\nthat it is \nnot any nefarious plot anywhere;\n it is just that a Jersey bilateral investment treaty is low down the in\n&#x2011;\ntray\n of some busy official somewhere. These are things \nthat\n appear very minor to the \nUnited Kingdom\n but are central to the trading activities of the Dependencies.  \nCathryn Hannah: Actually, in BIS this is really quite prioritised. An official from BIS who is working on this issue \ncame, \nprobably about a year ago now\n, to one of our Crown Dependencies’\n officials meetings to discuss bilateral investment treaties and the changes that were happening, as you say, with the ceding of competency. They are now in a very close working relationship with the Crown Dependencies on what can happen after this and whether the Crown Dependencies might need to be entrusted to enter into bilateral treaties in \ntheir\n own right. \nI\nt is a three\n&#x2011;\nway discussion between BIS, the Crown Dependencies and the EU Commission. It is something that I know is prioritised by BIS\n,\n and my understanding is they have a very good working relationship with the Crown Dependency officials in order to try and resolve this.  \nLord McNally: That is a good example. Only recently I wrote one of my little billet\ns\n&#x2011;\ndoux to Vince Cable, just to \nensure\n that he was making sure that BIS had enough alertness on these matters\n,\n because the point you make is very valid\n—which \nI made earlier\n—\nthat what is the \nNo. 1\n priority for the Crown Dependencies may not be very high on the list of priorities in a particular Government Department. \nI would also say, just listening to \nCathryn\n there, \nthat\n one of the good things to come out of the \nkind of \nfinancial cosh that we have been under is that it is massively, massively in the\n interests of the MO\nJ to make sure that this machinery is working and that we are constantly looking to make sure that it is working\n,\n because we do not want massive entanglements that we \nthen \nhave to deal with.  \nQ28 &#xa0; \nChair: You said earlier that you did not know of a case where legislation had been delayed as a bargaining issue. That does not appear to have been the case recently at all of there being such things, but in the area of entrustment it does happen\n,\n because essent\nially what happened over the FA\nT\nC\nA agreement with the United States\n—\ncan I put it to you this way\n?—\nis that\n,\n when \nentrustment was sought for this agreement, the UK Government effectively said, \n“We rather like this idea. \nYou can\n’\nt have entrustment until you have a treaty with us on the same lines\n.”\n Is bargaining still a feature of entrustment?\nLord McNally: I would say yes. Is that short enough as well?\nQ29 &#xa0; \nChair: Should it be?\nLord McNally: Yes. Again, in my candid friend role\n,\n I said to the Dependencies that it really would be intolerable if a fo\nreign Government—\nin this case the \nUnited States\n—\nwas given access to information that was being denied to the Unite\nd Kingdom Government. In the FA\nT\nC\nA case it was a perfectly legitimate stand\n-\noff to say that we wanted equality of treatment. That is the grow\nn-up world. The FA\nT\nC\nA was another example where the Crown Dependencies are going to have to be alert to being compliant with global demands on transparency in financial services.\nQ30 &#xa0; \nChair: Which is what they were doing by reaching that agreement, was it not?\nLord McNally: It was indeed. They did even better by concluding a similar agreement with our Government.\nQ31 &#xa0; \nChair: W\nhile I have the opportunity, could I pick up a couple of issues where consultation on matters does not seem to have worked very\n well?\n One of them refer\ns to HM Revenue and Customs, which\n issued new directions on passenger\n information that imposed a 12-\nhour notice period for flights into the UK from the Channel Islands, which is a shorter notice peri\nod than applies to EU countries;\n \nt\nhey have 24 hours. Another one was consultation about transferring the cost of investigating air accidents in their airspace to th\nem under the Chicago Convention. Those are\n a couple of issues where decisions appear to have been taken without enough time for a proper consultation.  \nCathryn Hannah: Absolutely. First, I do not know much about the second issue so we can write to you on that one\n,\n if that would be helpful.  \nChair: We may have written to you about it, actually.  \nCathryn Hannah: On the first issue, I have spoken to the Home Office and HMRC about this. What seems to have happened is that the policy on this was agreed several years ago and then what they were doing was then putting it into practice\n. T\nhe consultation should have happened several years ago. The officials assumed that it had\n,\n and then when things came into place we realised that the Crown De\npendencies had not been engaged and were not happy that the practic\nes that were currently happening in the \nChannel Islands\n were different \nfrom\n the policy. What has been really positive about this one is how quickly t\nhe Home Office and HMRC realised\n the issue and engaged with the Crown Dependencies. There has been regular contact now between officials in the Home Office and the Crown Dependen\ncies\n to try and resolve it. My understanding is that they are getting to the point of finding a resolution that will keep all parties happy. It shows how important \nat \nthe earliest stage of policy formation it is that the Crown Dependencies are engaged.\nQ32 &#xa0; \nChair: On\n a\n final international point before we move on to good government, of course in our previous report we reflected on a situation \nthat\n had arisen and probably has not had a \nparallel since then in the Icelandic banking crisis, where the interests of the Dependencies were not the sam\ne as those of the UK Government\n but the UK Government had a duty to represent those interests. It seemed to us that there is no mechanism for ensuring that in this case conflicting interests could be advanced and be seen to be advanced in the negotiating process. That was the one recommendation, as I recall it, that was not accepted by the Government, but\n,\n so far\n,\n you have not come up with an alternative way of dealing with the situation in which the assumption that the Dependencies will make\n,\n if there is a conflict of interest and an international negotiation about it\n,\n \nis that \nthe UK will look after its own interests an\nd forget about the Dependencies.\nLord McNally: I would hope that\n,\n in forming a \nUnited Kingdom\n view\n,\n it would take on board the interests of the Dependencies. What I do not think we could do and what we could concede is \nthat \nin major international negotiations the Crown Dependencies had a separate role. I think that would cause considerable confusion in terms of what are often very crucial international negotiations. You are going down a very dangerous road, in my opinion, if you are going to say that the Crown Dependencies are going to be separ\nately represented in such talks. \nThe Government would resist that\n,\n \nbut t\nhe counter to that is to make sure that their interests are taken on board by those undertaking those negotiations. This is not unusual in all kinds of countries and federations and the rest, but in the end there has to be \nonly \none message from the \nUnited Kingdom\n.\nQ33 &#xa0; \nChair: The \nUnited Kingdom\n is the \nUnited Kingdom\n:\n it is not the Crown Dependencies. Does that mean you go into negotiations saying, \n“T\nhe United Kingdom thinks this\n,” and say\n nothing at al\nl about the Crown Dependencies in an issue where\n they are a central player\n,\n as in the Icelandic banking crisis?\nLord McNally: Where they are a central player then it is obvious and I would hope that we would take fully on board their interests\n,\n expertise and experience, but I do not think you could go into such negotiations with the Crown Dependencies arguing a different route than the British Government\n,\n unless, as I say, that takes you down a road which clearly the Crown Dependencies do not want to go. There are responsibilities to the relationship with the Crown and the \nUnited Kingdom\n, as well as benefits for them. I can go no further than to say I think it will be very dangerous to follow your advice on that particular aspect\n,\n and that remains the view of the Government.  \nCathryn Hannah: Can I just add \nthat we do it on a case-by-case basis? T\nhere are certain things where the Crown Dependencies are able to represent their views. I know, \nfor example, the recent MONEYVAL—\n \nChair: For example?\nCathryn Hannah: MONEYVAL\n is an anti\n&#x2011;\nmoney\n laundering and terrorist finance organisation which HMT have engaged in and got \na \nstatus \nin \nso that the Crown Dependencies can voice their opinions and engage as the Crown D\nependencies. It is about a case-by-\ncase situation and an understanding where the Crown Dependencies\n’\n priorities are, getting them engaging with policy officials early, particularly on those \ninterests that really do matter, \nand then working with them to find out the best way that their perspectives can be heard\n. B\nut, as Lord McNally says, it might not necessarily be that several views are put at the negotiating table at one time.  \nLord McNally: I am all in favour\n,\n if some specialist\ns are\n gathering and they are looking at an area where the Crown Dependencies have specialist knowledge, that we make room for them in \nthe \nteams that go to that\n gathering\n, but \nin \nthe G20, \nG8 and the European Council\n it is not possible.\nQ34 &#xa0; \nChair: The European Council is a different case because\n they are not members of the EU.\nLord McNally: No.\nQ35 &#xa0; \nAndy McDonald: Can I turn your attention to issues of good government\n,\n because the independence and the powers of self\n&#x2011;\ndetermination of the CDs \nare, the previous Committee concluded, \nonly \nto \nbe set aside in the most extreme and serious circumstances\n—\neffectively where \nthe rule of law has broken down?\n We have had lots of written representations from \nresidents\n of Jersey and the Isle of Man asking for the \nUK\n to intervene on the grounds of good government. \nDo\n you think we have the level of intervention at the right level\n,\n and is it of any benefit to try to describe exactly what that might look like, where the UK may intervene? Would that assist us in any way to \nattempt to \nbe\n more\n clear\n \nabout that?\nLord McNally: As I said in my opening remarks, both this Committee and \nKilbrandon\n set out a very high line to clear before the British Government would intervene. Tempting as it sometimes is to say, \n“\nWe will go in and put them right\n,”\n I \nwould \nsay this Committee has been very wise and the Government will still hold to the fact that\n,\n unless th\nere is real evidence of a break\ndown either in the policing or the integrity of the judiciary or general law and order, we would not. The \nIslands\n are self\n&#x2011;\ngoverning. By any criteria they are governed well, but there will always be criticisms of governance and we would have to take them on board in deciding our own relations. \nWhen I say the Dependencies are governed well\n,\n I make an exception in terms of \nSark\n. I do not give Sark a clean bill of health and we may go on to that, but I do give Jersey, Guernsey and the \nIsle of Man\n such a clean\n bill of health—\n \nQ36 &#xa0; \nChair: For the record\n,\n you had better \nsay whether you \ninclude \nAlderney\n in that list.  \nLord McNally: \nAlderney\n as well. \nAlderney\n has other problems but I do not think they are ones of governance. \nW\nhen attacks are made on any particular institution in the Crown Dependencies, there are already in existence machineries to test those accusations and to make judgment on them. I do not think it is a good idea for the Minister of the day, as it were, to be making subjective judgments on problems. If you have confidence\n, and \nI do\n, \nin policing, \nand \nif you have confidence\n, and \nI do\n, \nin the judiciary, then they should be able to handle any problems that ar\nise in a proper and tested way—and I think t\nhey do.\nQ37 &#xa0; \nAndy McDonald: Can I just ask you to revisit the issue of \nSark\n? You specifically mentioned that. Perhaps we could deal with that in a little bit more detail because there have been some issues that have arisen there with the separation of powers with the dual role of the Seneschal and then the suggestion that there \nshould \nbe an observer in place for the 2012 elections. I believe, Sir Alan, when we visited they were about to appoin\nt somebody to assist the chief a\ndministrator. Perhaps you might comment about that. We ha\nve previously said that the MO\nJ should maintain a watching brief on \nSark\n.\n \nP\nerhaps you might be able to say a little b\nit more about how that is going.\nLord McNally: Yes. By any standards I have kept a watching brief on \nSark\n, whilst being conscious of the high hurdle that has to be cleared in terms of direct intervention. It is worth remembering that \nSark\n has only had democracy since the 2008 reforms. It has only had two elections. The turnout in those two elections would make us in \nWestminster\n envious in that \nit was\n 78\n%/\n79%. In their own evidence to you\n,\n they say that we do not fully appreciate how wedded at least some people are on \nSark\n to the old ways. Up to 2008 it was a feudal regime. That is true. My experience is that there are people who long for the good old days of feudal rule and the certainty that it provided, but the world has moved on. They have to operate to 21st century standards\n,\n and for some on \nSark\n that has been a painful process. \nMy only interest in \nSark\n is good governance. I have no missionary zeal to push them one way or the other, other than the fact that\n,\n for example\n,\n on the question of the Seneschal\n,\n the Supreme Court told them that the combination of judge and presiding officer was incompatible with a functioning democracy. To say that we had rushed them when it took t\nhem three years to implement it\n may be \n“\nrushing\n”\n in \nSark\n terms\n,\n but it was a reasonable time to expect action to be taken.\nOn the election observer, we had had talks for a number of months and I did twist arms a little towards the end, partly because I wanted to avoid having an election where immediately afterwards there would be cries of foul. If they reflect, the fact that they had an external observer avoided that. I feel some sense of failure in a way \nin regard to\n an island of 600 people\n that\n in many ways is idyllic\n. \nI can see the attractions of going back to \nthe\n quieter, more leisurely, more certain age it has, but it also has to provide a living for people. It has to have some economic future other than for retirees who have pensions that they have already made. It has to give a future for young people and for a working population. \nI just feel at the moment \nthat \nthere is not enough empathy in the community of people clinging to the old ways, who fear change, who oppose investments and ideas. They just see everybody as an enemy and the others just see the others as barriers to progress. We have made considerable efforts to find common ground\n,\n to encourage dialogue and to work towards some kind of settled future for \nSark\n. \nCathryn\n has given an enormous amount of her time to try and help \nSark\n manage its own way forward.\nQ38 &#xa0; \nChair: Before we hand over to Ms Hannah, anyone listening to the issue who is not familiar with the situation on Sark would wonder what on earth you are talking about when you talked about one group of people and the others. Let us be clear what \nwe are talking about.\n \nT\nhose who represent the majority view in the Chief Pleas, which is the \nParliament\n of Sark, and the Barclay Brothers and their management of their economic interests on the island, tend to express their dissatisfaction in extremely strident terms or, of course, to take court action\n,\n which led to some of the democratic changes.  \nLord McNally: Yes. I was almost tempted to bring two guides to you. One is the \nSark Scribe\n and the other is the \nSark Newsletter\n. In the \nSark Scribe\n, \nSark\n is a bucolic land of people\n,\n sheep racing, maypole dancing and having tea at the vicarage. In the \nSark Newsletter\n, \nSark\n is a fascist 1930s state. Let me be clear and I say again, as I have said to the Barclay Brothers and to their representative, \nthat \nI wish they would cease publication of the \nSark Newsletter\n because it impedes getting the kind of empathetic relationships in \nSark\n that would take the island forward. \nI also equally say to those who think that the future of \nSark\n is in the past\n \nthat \nthat is not possible. They are going to have to adapt so that they can have the machinery. At the moment it is very difficult to look to somebody who properly gives leadership in \nSark\n. We have had two external individuals who have looked at it and both \nhave \ngiven suggestions of how to improve good governance, which are now the property of the Chief Pleas of \nSark\n. I am not there to draw up solutions for them\n,\n but they do have, to my mind, good suggestions for taking this forward and they would be sensible to do so. I am very grateful that they have recently appointed a chief officer\n,\n who I hope will give some structure to the governance. \nI understand it is going to be a slow process, but I think it would be better if we could take some of the poison on both sides out as well\n,\n because\n,\n as well as the \nSark Newsletter\n,\n I also see some of the blogs that are alive in the island, which are equally intolerant of the other point of view. In such a small community\n,\n these things hurt\n,\n they cause resentment and they make progress more difficult.  \nCathryn Hannah: What we have tried to do, really, is help \nSark\n as it takes the governance issues forward, as Lord McNally says. We helped them administer a perception survey of the local population last year, which helped identify some of the issues that the\n local population feel on Sark—\nfor example\n,\n people being really worried about the economic situation or \nwishing\n to see more land reform. \nW\ne have also tried to run a series of workshops with the Chief Pleas, looking at things such as corporate governance and how you create a strategic plan to give them those tools so \nthat \nthey can progress things. \nIn October, with colleagues from Guernsey and \nJersey\n, we helped organise some economic development workshops, again so \nthat they can\n start planning for the future. There is a lot of impetus from some people within the Chief Pleas to take these bits of work forward and to strengthen Sark for the future\n,\n and a recognition that in order to keep what is special about Sark \nit\n needs to have these governance arrangements in place so \nthat \nit can function effectively.\nQ39 &#xa0; \nChair: Can we leave \nSark\n behind and turn to the\n more general issue? I want to have in mind a situation \nthat\n has arisen in the Isle of Man without particularly discussing it because it is not a good thing for pending court matters, even \nwhen they are \nbeyond the reach of our sub \njudice\n rule, to be discussed in \nthe \nlegislature. One of the things that that kind of experience indicates is that\n,\n if people are to have confidence that the smallness of a jurisdiction is not going to weaken its ability to deal with difficult situations\n,\n it needs to be clear that they can get outside assistance, whether it \nis in the judiciary or among\n the prosecutorial team when a case arises \nthat\n involves someone at a senior level in the local structure. It is a problem \nthat\n can arise in any of the jurisdictions. As far as I understand it\n,\n they all have \nthe \npractice of bringing in experienced judicial figures or lawyers from the \nUnited Kingdom\n when this kind of thing happens. Is the Ministry of Justice involved in that process\n,\n and are you happy that it is in place and used when it needs to be?\nLord McNally: Yes. Again, \nCathryn\n can comment in any detail that she wants, but my feeling is \nthat \nin all the jurisdictions \nthat \nhas worked extremely w\nell. \nWhen the \nIsle of Man\n had an issue they informed me very early. They took advice from an external legal opinion and they brought in an acting law officer to cover. We have also suggested, \nfor what\n may be a slight weakness in the \nIsle of Man\n set-\nup, th\nat they have a Solicitor-General as well as an Attorney-\nGeneral\n,\n \nwhich we think gives a good back-\nup.\nQ40 &#xa0; \nChair: In other words\n,\n there \nshould be a deputy.\nLord McNally: Yes. The \nIsle of Man\n have dealt with the problem well and that shows the system works. From my own experience in terms of visiting the other Dependencies, there is a regular habit of bringing in expert judicial and policing expertise\n,\n which, as you say, gives confidence to the operation of both the judiciary and the police in the Dependencies.\nQ41 &#xa0; \nChair: Can I raise one fairly technical issue\n,\n which, if you do not have the answer with you, you can write to us about? It was raised with us by \nGuernsey\n because of a dispute between them and HM Revenue and Customs about the constitutional position. In the past they were able to refer such disputes to \nthe Cabinet Office legal adviser\ns for an opinion, which has generally enabled things to move forward. They made such a request in July\n,\n but it was suggested that the Cabinet Office may be unable to assist. When we last heard from them, \nGuernsey\n’s legal advise\nrs were waiting to hear whether\n the Cabinet Office legal advise\nrs would in the event consider giving the advice. It looks as though a relatively straightforward way of dealing with a problem \nthat\n can arise\n is no longer available to them.\nLord McNally: I am tempted to say \nthat \nthis is the first example I have had of the Cabinet Office not being willing to give an opinion on anything\n,\n but, actually, \nCathryn\n has a more judicial answer.\nChair: A \nj\nudicious\n answer\n.  \nCathryn Hannah: The Cabinet Office has never been the only port of call for the\nse\n kinds of issu\nes. At the MO\nJ \nwe try and\n look at the specific issue and work out who is the most appropriate part of HMG to deal with it\n,\n but, rather than going into too much detail here, if you are happy\n,\n we can write to you about the background of this and also explain what we are doing to help Guernsey try and resolve this particular issue.\nQ42 &#xa0; \nJeremy Corbyn: Is this sort of shadow-\nboxing around the fundamental issue of the massive tax imbalance between the taxation regime in the rest of the \nUK\n and the taxation regime on all of the Dependencies?\nCathryn Hannah: I do not think so. This is more a specific issue in the way that HMRC operates in relation to Customs and the information it shares more broadly\n,\n and ensuring that Guernsey and HMRC have a sensible way of sharing information that is constitutionally sound but also allows for the information to be shared. I do not think it is anything more wide than that.\nChair: \nThank you very much indeed. We are grateful to you bo\nth. We wish you well, Ms Hannah, on your\n maternity leave\n,\n and we are grateful for your help this morning.  \nLord McNally: We are grateful to the Committee. I understand \ntoday\n is your 40 years and one day as a Member of Parliament.\nJeremy Corbyn: Life begins at 40\n!\n  \nChair: Thank you, Mr \nCorbyn\n.  \n&#xa0;\n              \nOral evidence: Crown Dependencies: developments since 2010\n HC \n726\n              \n              \n17\n"
