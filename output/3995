default1.1 
defaultThis submission from the Ass
defaultociation of Chief Executives of 
defaultVoluntary Organisations (ACEVO), to the Public Administration Select Committee (PASC), outlines ACEVO’s position on executive pay in the charitable sector (‘the sector’). It describes the nature o
defaultf executive pay in 
defaultthe sector – captured by the 
defaultACEVO
default Pay Survey 
default2013-14
default 
default– how pay is set; and the grounds on which ACEVO believes good pay should be evaluated.

defaultACEVO believes the pay of charity executives is right if it represents 
defaultvalue for moneydefault as j
defaultudged

defaultthe Board of Trustees
default,
default informed by 
defaultcharity beneficiaries, funder
defaults
default 
defaultand staff. In this submission we offer a number of metrics and tools for the Committee to 
defaultconsider during their inquiry
default. We welcome this opportunity to i
defaultnput into the Committee’s 
defaultwork.
default2.1 One of the greatest virtues of the charity sector is its diversity. It includes organisations of all sizes, aims and areas of operation.
default2.2 There are 163,361 registered charities in the UK.
default 42% h
defaultave an annual income under £10,000. 75% have an annual income under £100,000. Only 6.1% have an income over £500,000, with 1,892 (1.2%) having an annual income over £5 million.
default2.3 The 
defaultACEVO Pay Survey
default 2013/14
default (launched 20 November 2013) surveyed 678 chie
defaultf executives from amongst ACEVO’s members. It is the most comprehensive guide to CEO pay available, and has been published annually by ACEVO for more tha
defaultn two
default decade
defaults
default.

defaultMedian Chief Executive Pay is £60,000 (from 650 
defaultrespondents to this question). The lower quartile is £45,000 and the upper quartile is £78,000.
default•default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe gender pay gap, among charity Chief Executives, has widened to its largest extent in several years. The median is £67,000 for men and £54,530 for women
default, so 
defaultwomen are paid 18.6% less.
default•default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe regional pay gap remains striking. Median pay for CEOs with offices in London was £70,000, while the lowest was for 
defaultthose in Scotland, at £45,401. It is notable that of the 14 charities in the Disasters Emergency Committee, w
defaulthose salaries were in the news in August 2013, only 3 have head offices outside London.
default•default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default82.8% of Chief Executives in the sector are on defined contribution or money purchase pension schemes, in contrast to more generous final salary or defined benefi
defaultt 
defaultschemes still prevalent in other
default sector
defaults
default.
default&#xa0;default2.4 Chief Executive Pay correlates closely with increasing organisation size. Figure 1 shows that median salary only reaches £100,000 when the number of employees exceeds 1000. This figure does not include volunt
defaulteers.
defaultFigure 1: Pay correlates closely with the number of employees in an organisation.defaultTo give an idea of organisation size at the top end of the above graph, Mencap’s CEO, who is paid £137,500, is responsible for 6,800 staff. Oxfam’s CEO (£119,500) i
defaults responsible for around 5,000 staff and tens of thousands of volunteers.
default2.5 Chief Executive Pay varies considerably by charity sub-sector. For example the median salary was £78,858 
defaultfor sports charities 
default(the highest median)
default, and £49,000 for religious 
defaultcharities (the lowest median)
default. Sports charities also had the highest minimum pay in the sample, at £46,000. Other outliers include certain cultural charities, such 
defaultas the Royal Opera House whose Chief E
defaultxecutive receives £250,000,
default and whose previous Chief 
defaultExecutive received £390,000, the highest pay in the sector at the time.
default Healthcare charities, whose executives will often be clinicians, 
defaultalso tend to be highly paid
default, particularly if their procedures demand that Chief Executive pay 
defaultcannot be lower than
default oth
defaulter directors’
default salaries
default. 
default2.6
default Chief Executive Pay correlates 
defaultclosely with charities’ revenue.
default Median CEO salary is £34,600 for charities with a revenue of less than £150,000
default, whereas the median only 
defaultexceeds the £100,000 threshold as charities reach a 
defaultrevenue
default of £25-50 million.
default&#xa0;default3.1 In spite of the difficulties of applying one set of principles to suc
defaulth an obviously diverse sector, 
defaultACEVO recommends cer
defaulttain good practices when it comes to setting Chief Executive Pay. 
default3.2 Charity pay at director level and above is the responsibility of the Board of Trustees, 
defaultwhose decision-mak
defaulting will be overseen
default by the Chair
default. In large charities the Trustees will often 
defaultdelegate the s
defaultetting of executive pay to a Remuneration
default Sub-Committee, which decides executive salaries and pension schemes. 
defaultIt might
default also review the responsibili
defaultty for 
defaultsetting other staff pay, 
defaultor delegate it
default to the appropriate Finance or Human Resources d
defaultirector.
default3.3 Many large charities also use recruitment consultants to assist with recruiting senior executives. Together with the charity’s Board of Trustees, consultants will usually set pay after considering organisation turnover, number of employees, in
default-job risk, pay of other directors and the possible use of performance-related incentives. Pay levels may also reflect the need to retain employees who may consider jobs in other related sectors. For example, international agencies such as the UN can of
defaultfer 
defaultdirector pay of at least £80
default,000, so 
defaultlarge international aid charities such as Oxfam, British Red Cross and Save the Children (all of which pay their CEOs over £100,000) need to keep their pay competitive to attract and retain the best leadership. Pay is o
defaultften set according to the dictates of the organisation and the job market in the sector, just as would happen in any other industry. Boards often also consider average senior pay in other comparable sectors, such as:
default&#xa0;
default3.4 ACEVO recognises that th
defaultere may not be sufficient publ
defaultic
defaultly-available guidance on the considerations that trustees make when setting executive pay. This is why 
defaultare working
default to publicise
default five principles of best practice for the charity sector when setting pay for employees. These principles ensure value for money for beneficiaries, staff, 
defaultfunder
defaults and the 
defaultpublic purse
default.  They are: transparency, proportionality, performance, retention and pr
defaultotocol.
default3.5 These principles are appropriate to charities of all sizes. In larger charities where trustees are more distant from the day-to-day running of the organisation, they may delegate control over pay to a Remuneration Committee. Its terms of refere
defaultnce would be formally approved by a vote of the trustees, and control over pay of other 
defaultemployees
default delegated to a Finance or Human Resources Director. Charity Commission Document CC8, section D7 briefly outlines the Commission’s good practice guidance for c
defaultontrol, by trustees, over wages and salaries.
default A
defaultCEVO
default recommends this practice for larger charities and recommends that the principles of good pay apply to the work of remuneration committees.

default4. defaultConclusion: defaultACEVO’s principles for good paydefault&#xa0;default4.1 
defaultAbove all, ACEVO believes that good pay for any charity employee means charity beneficiaries, donors and employees agree that it provides good value for money.default4.2 Recent opinion polls show 
defaultcharities are among the most trusted organisations in society
default, but that the public are also concerned about the pay of charity leaders.
default ACEVO acknowledges concer
defaultns expressed by members of the Public Administration Select Committee 
defaultand the wider public th
defaultat methods of setting pay in the sector may not be sufficiently transparent, and works constantly to promote transparency and an emphasis on 
defaultvalue for money within the sector

defaultpublishing data

default,
default and ensure
default that charities remain among our country’s most trusted organisations.
