[normal]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.1
[normal]              
[normal]Transport for London (TfL) welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the 
[normal]              
[normal]Committee’s inquiry into 
[normal]winter resili
[normal]ence in transport
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.

[normal]              
[normal]O
[normal]ur organisation and London Councils, the body representing all the London boroughs and the City of London, ha
[normal]ve well-developed plans, prepar
[normal]ed alongside the emergency services and Network Rail, to keep the transport 
[normal]network
[normal] open th
[normal]roughout severe weather. 
[normal] As well as the C
[normal]apital’s road network, t
[normal]his includes
[normal] 
[normal]roads and footways linking to
[normal] bus garages and 
[normal]bus 
[normal]stations, railway 
[normal]and U
[normal]nderground 
[normal]stations, hospitals
[normal], 
[normal]and police, fire and ambulance stations across the city.
[normal] 
[normal]During 
[normal]pe
[normal]riods of severe weather, TfL
[normal] and borough staff will work aroun
[normal]d the clock across
[normal] London Underground
[normal] (LU)
[normal], 
[normal]and our b
[normal]us, 
[normal]r
[normal]ail and road networks to min
[normal]imise disruption during adverse
[normal] winter weather
[normal] conditions.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]              
[normal]Salt is stockpiled by us
[normal] and the borough
[normal]s
[normal] to ensure that all road users
[normal] can 
[normal]           
[normal]continue to move around the Capital.
[normal] 
[normal]A fleet of 
[normal]road 
[normal]gritters
[normal] will be deplo
[normal]yed 
[normal]   
[normal]           to keep the roads clear and 
[normal]arrangements are in place to enable the 
[normal]              
[normal]boroughs to share salt stores, if 
[normal]necessary. 
[normal]A pan-London Strategic Salt 
[normal]           
[normal]Reserve is also available should 
[normal]              
[normal]replenishment arrangements via the normal 
[normal]           
[normal]supply chain be disrupted.  Where exceptional rainfall is forecast, heavy duty 
[normal]           
[normal]pumps are placed on standby to react 
[normal]to localised flooding, so as to keep our 
[normal]           
[normal]main road network operable.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4      
[normal]De-icing trains will be in operation, keeping tracks as clear as possible; 
[normal]   
[normal]           
[normal]p
[normal]latforms will be gritted and lineside equipment, including point motors, 
[normal]will be 
[normal]  
[normal]checked. 
[normal]Staff and contractors are used to keep the platforms 
[normal]and 
[normal]Tube 
[normal]station
[normal] areas clear and de-iced. 
[normal]Network Rail, whose tracks are 
[normal]used by certain U
[normal]nderground
[normal] 
[normal]services and which
[normal] manage
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]most
[normal] of 
[normal]the infrastructure used by London
[normal] 
[normal]Overground
[normal], 
[normal]also work
[normal]s
[normal] closely with us to prepare the network
[normal] for winter
[normal] conditions
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5
[normal]              
[normal]Londoners and visitors to the city 
[normal]should check our
[normal] website
[normal], particularly 
[normal]during periods of severe
[normal] weather t
[normal]o help 
[normal]them 
[normal]plan ahead and to get
[normal] travel information on the move.

[normal]              
[normal]Each part of TfL

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]      
[normal]We have 
[normal]weather forecasting contracts in place 
[normal]for our
[normal] network
[normal]s, and which are specific to the affected m
[normal]odes.

[normal]action on 
[normal]the basis of
[normal] 
[normal]data 
[normal]provided by a weather
[normal] forecasting service from 
[normal]           
[normal]MeteoG
[normal]roup and from 
[normal]our 
[normal]own weather station information. During severe 
[normal]           
[normal]winter weather, a ‘snow desk’
[normal] 
[normal]is established in 
[normal]our 
[normal]London Streets Traffic 
[normal]           Control Centre 
[normal](LSTCC) to 
[normal]coordinate
[normal] sal
[normal]ting and snow ploughing operations
[normal] 
[normal]           
[normal]and 
[normal]to 
[normal]liaise with 
[normal]the

[normal]Operational processes
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]Roads 
[normal]–
[normal] 
[normal]we are responsible for the treatment of all of London’s Red Routes, a 
[normal]              
[normal]network of 580km.  Throughout winter, a fleet of 40 gritters, all of which can 
[normal]              
[normal]be fitted with ploughs, as well as 
[normal]gritting quad bikes, flat bed trucks and teams
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]of operatives are on standby for deployment
[normal] across the network. 
[normal]We have 
[normal]           agreed with the 
[normal]boroughs a list of core bus routes, bus garage locations and 
[normal]           bus stands to 
[normal]ensure bus services c
[normal]an be maintained.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]              
[normal]M
[normal]ost highway authorities have gritting networks which are prioritised by use, 
[normal]with both the 
[normal]Transport for London Road Network (TLRN)
[normal] and
[normal] the Strategic Road N
[normal]etwork
[normal] (SRN)
[normal], are treated
[normal] as high priority. The frequency and type of treatm
[normal]ent is 
[normal]dependent
[normal] on prevailing and forecast weather conditions to ensure the entire network remains operable. Reports of the planned treatments are sent to stakeholders.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal]              
[normal]Priority routes for gritting are al
[normal]so published on our
[normal] website
[normal] and include 
[normal]              
[normal]main 
[normal]roads, bus routes and roads leading to fire stations and hospitals, etc.  
[normal]              
[normal]Pavements 
[normal]in busy areas will also be treat
[normal]ed to help pedestrians and support 
[normal]              
[normal]local businesses.  A pan-London Strategic Salt Reserve is also available for 
[normal]              
[normal]us and the boroughs shoul
[normal]d supplies become low during the winter.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6
[normal]              
[normal]Bus
[normal]es – our objective 
[normal]during periods of heavy snow 
[normal]is 
[normal]to help maintain 
[normal]many routes running a
[normal]s
[normal] normal 
[normal]a 
[normal]service as possible, providing passengers with a safe journey to their destinations. Contingency planning is reliant on working closely with 
[normal]bus o
[normal]perators, 
[normal]the 
[normal]LSTCC and 
[normal]our 
[normal]Asset Management
[normal] 
[normal]Directorate when requesting or receiving priority gritting or sno
[normal]w
[normal] 
[normal]clearing requests on the T
[normal]LRN
[normal]. It also relies on close contact with the

[normal] 
[normal]–
[normal] 
[normal]we have
[normal] produced guidance regarding winter clothing and reflective 
[normal]              
[normal]safety equipment and advise all cyclists to take extra care while cycling during 
[normal]              
[normal]winter months. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.8
[normal]              
[normal]The Barclays Cycle Hire scheme and 
[normal]Cycle Superhighways fall within the 
[normal]              
[normal]winter 
[normal]contingency plans of the TfL Asset Management
[normal] Directorate and the

[normal]explained above
[normal].
[normal] [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.9
[normal]              
[normal]Our 
[normal]London River Services 
[normal]division 
[normal]maintain
[normal]s
[normal] stocks of salt to ensure that 
[normal]              
[normal]pedestrian 
[normal]access areas on 
[normal]the 
[normal]approaches to 
[normal]its
[normal] piers are maintained for 
[normal]              
[normal]safe use of passengers. Access roads to the Woolwich Ferry 
[normal]t
[normal]erminal are 
[normal]              
[normal]maintained under the winter service plans of 
[normal]our

[normal]Treatments
[normal] and de-icing
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.11
[normal]              
[normal]The highways winter 
[normal]service is operable
[normal] between 1October and 30
[normal] 
[normal]April. 
[normal]           
[normal]Treatment
[normal] plans are maintained by 
[normal]our 
[normal]Roads Directorate. These are 
[normal]            
[normal]reviewed
[normal] and optimised 
[normal] annually with input from 
[normal]across our organisation 
[normal]as 
[normal]            
[normal]well as 
[normal]from 
[normal]e
[normal]xternal stakeholders including b
[normal]oroughs.

[normal]2.
[normal]12
[normal]              
[normal]The winter season started on 1
[normal] October
[normal] and as of that date w
[normal]e are
[normal] ready 
[normal]           
[normal]to treat the network with plant and materials 
[normal]standing by. 
[normal]Our salt stock levels 
[normal]           
[normal]have been revised in accordance with national guidance and we now have a 
[normal]           
[normal]contracted minimum stock level, sufficient to treat the network 90 times, whic
[normal]h 
[normal]           
[normal]equates to a minimum stock of s
[normal]ome 10,000 tonnes. 
[normal]Current stock levels 
[normal]           
[normal]stand at approximately 14,400 tonnes, giving an operational buffer of 4,400 
[normal]           
[normal]tonnes.  Stock replenishment will be undertaken during the season so as
[normal] to 
[normal]         
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]maintain an operational buffer and only in c
[normal]ontinual severe conditions will
[normal]         
[normal] 
[normal] there 
[normal]be a risk of stock levels falling below the minimum 10,000 tonne 
[normal]          
[normal] 
[normal]requirement. 
[normal]Salt usage through the winter will obviously depend on th
[normal]e 
[normal]         
[normal] 
[normal] conditions that 
[normal]ultimately develop
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.13
[normal]   
[normal]As risk mitigation against in season shortage of salt from suppliers, TfL has 
[normal]          
[normal]established a pan-London Reserve Salt Stock of 27,000t, held at Dagenham, 
[normal]          
[normal]available to ourselves and the boroughs. This is to be used 
[normal]as a last resort
[normal]          
[normal]after all supply chain or options for mutual aid between neighbouring 
[normal]          
[normal]authorities have been exhausted. With prudent use that should be sufficient to 
[normal]        
[normal]  
[normal]treat London’s key ‘resilience’ routes for a period of about two weeks.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Command and control
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.14
[normal]              
[normal]We 
[normal]use the ‘Gold’, ‘Silver’, ‘Bronze’ structure. This relates to the role that each person within the command structure will play as opposed to ‘rank’, the
[normal] roles being Strategic, Tactical and Operational respectively. It mirrors the structure utilised by the emergency services and is used by senior managers across 
[normal]TfL
[normal] on a regular basis for major planned events. The same command structure is also utilised by the Metropolitan Police’s Safer Transport Command and 
[normal]Traffic Operational Command Unit
[normal] whose operations centre
[normal],
[normal] Metrocomm
[normal],
[normal] is co-located 
[normal]with our 
[normal]Surface Transport
[normal] Traffic Control Centre
[normal] in Palestra
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.15
[normal]              
[normal]We have 
[normal]agreed activation and communications processes with 
[normal]the LLACC
[normal], 
[normal]              
[normal]which is managed by London Fire Brigade Emergency Planning.

[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]We facilitate

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]TfL’s rail network 
[normal]and LU
[normal] use the Met Office to predict levels of snowfall and ice accumulation
[normal] as well as our own 
[normal]network
[normal]-wide
[normal] rail temperature equipment. To complement this, MeteoGroup provide a forecast rail icing risk at over 20 locations over the LU network (the locations eac
[normal]h have instrumented sets of rail for temperature and moisture, which give real time data). 
[normal]London 
[normal]R
[normal]ail
[normal] collects local temperature informa
[normal]tion from defined cold spot location
[normal]s. This information 
[normal]triggers the
[normal] response plans
[normal] as appropriate

[normal] work on five day readiness proce
[normal]ss
[normal] 
[normal]for a predicted forecast of snow and a similar three day readiness process for ice, both of 
[normal]which aim to minimise the impact of the forecasted weather.  All affected rail routes are 
[normal]pre-emptively treated in the hour
[normal]s leading up to 
[normal]and then during 
[normal]winter
[normal] weather conditions
[normal] in accordance with pre-determined plans
[normal]. Where routes 
[normal]are affected
[normal], contingency plans are in place to divert customers and curtail rail services to concentrate on pr

[normal]              
[normal]If snow is forecast, contracts are in place to obtain around 200 additional staff per shift to keep walkways clear,

[normal] Apps for passengers are being developed utilising TfL     
[normal]           data, via third parties, and strategies for communication and public 
[normal]           information being devised for pre-planned and anticipated events, which 
[normal]           in
[normal]cludes adverse weather. Disruption to National Rail services creates 
[normal]           additional demands for our own operations as passengers switch to

[normal]4.3      The value of multi-agency collaboration was clearly demonstrated by the 
[normal]           success of the Transport Coordina
[normal]tion Centre
[normal] (TCC) during the 
[normal]2012
[normal] Games
[normal]. 
[normal]           
[normal]Since then we have improved the way we work
[normal] with Network Rail and 
[normal]           
[normal]other operators and have created
[normal] a multi-agency coordination centre, 
[normal] 
[normal]           modelled 
[normal]on the TCC, available to facilitate collaborative operational and 
[normal]           communications responses where required.

[normal]              
[normal]Following the severe weather in February 2009, TfL with the London 
[normal]              
[normal]Technical Advisors Group
[normal], set up a highway
[normal]s winter service project 
[normal]              
[normal]board. 
[normal]              
[normal]We 
[normal]facilitated a pan
[normal]-
[normal]London workshop which was attended by all London 
[normal]              
[normal]b
[normal]oroughs. From this workshop and other meetings following the winter of 
[normal]              
[normal]2009/10
[normal],
[normal] London was one of the first areas in the UK to develop a 
[normal]              
[normal]carriageway
[normal] treatment
[normal] re
[normal]silience network. This is a sub-
[normal]set of the main 
[normal]           
[normal]treatment
[normal] networks, coordinated between boroughs to allow the most 
[normal]           
[normal]important roads
[normal],
[normal] including key bus routes
[normal],
[normal] to operate when salt stocks are 
[normal]           
[normal]low. This network
[normal] proved essential in managing the allocation of salt during 
[normal]           
[normal]the winter of 
[normal]              
[normal]2009/10. At th
[normal]at
[normal] time TfL
[normal],
[normal] through our contractors
[normal],
[normal] manage
[normal]d
[normal] the 
[normal]           
[normal]distribution of salt supplies coming into London.
