[[[Executive ]]]

[[[Summary]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1&#xa0;&#xa0; Before responding to the questions posed by the Committee we would make two points.&#xa0;1.2&#xa0;&#xa0; Local amenities have been replaced by more centralised units or by more remote development, meaning people are having to travel further. This is obviously linked to a rise in car ownership, but a quarter of households in Great Britain, for a variety of reasons, do not have a car. &#xa0;1.3&#xa0;&#xa0; Isolation is important to define as it is not just people in sparsely populated and rural areas that experience isolation. Even in urban and suburban areas people may be isolated due to poor public transport and lack of many public amenities.&#xa0;1.4&#xa0;&#xa0; We strongly welcome this inquiry. It is evident that Government spending cuts are making the issue of isolation worse as passenger transport has been significantly cut over the last three years. The Campaign for Better Transport has recently been working to highlight the issues passengers face in isolated communities, and rural communities in particular. Over the last few months we have campaigned for sustained support of rural transport up to and beyond the Spending Round. &#xa0;1.5&#xa0;&#xa0; We have recently published four pieces of research of relevance to the Inquiry

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;1.6&#xa0;&#xa0; All of these studies point towards how important getting public transport right is for low income groups&#xa0;1.7&#xa0;&#xa0; All modes of passenger transport are important but it is fair to say the most important and most frequently used mode of passenger transport in rural areas is the bus; therefore we shall be focusing strongly on buses and their importance throughout this submission of written evidence. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1&#xa0;&#xa0; The needs of different groups of passengers are only occasionally taken into account when determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities. These groups include:

[[[Disabled Passengers]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.2&#xa0;&#xa0; Before briefly highlighting the needs of these different groups of passengers we would like to highlight three points which should be taken into account when determining provision of public transport to isolated communities.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.3&#xa0;&#xa0; The following briefly identifies the needs of user groups that heavily rely on public transport.

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.4&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Passenger Transport and Isolation for the Elderly]]] - Public transport isolation for the elderly is a very serious issue. Public transport is a lifeline for many older people, with many elderly people unable to drive public transport is the only option and for many people over the age of 65 this option is not available. Public transport for the elderly enables them to connect with them with friends, family and their community whilst allowing them access to health and social care and other key services. &#xa0;2.5&#xa0;&#xa0; Older people and younger people make more trips by passenger transport (bus, coach and rail) than any other age group. This coincides with a decline in the number of people holding a car driving licence with age; only 35 per cent of pensioner households in rural areas have no access to a car. &#xa0;2.6&#xa0;&#xa0; The accessibility of public transport differs significantly between urban and rural communities. In urban areas the percentage of people who live within 13 minutes of a regular (hourly) bus is around 95%, in rural areas it falls to 50%.

[[[n for the Young]]]

[[[ - ]]]Young people travel a shorter total distance and make fewer journeys than they used to but must now make longer journeys to reach their most frequent destinations. They make most of their journeys by car but, in common with older people, they use cars less and travel by bus more than people in the middle age groups.&#xa0;2.8&#xa0;&#xa0; Young people make significantly fewer car journeys than they did – down from almost 600 trips per person each year in the mid-1990s to 377 trips in 2011 – and fewer young people now own cars or have driving licences (only 38% of 17-20 year olds now have a driving license compared to 48% in the early 1990s). The provision of public transport to compensate for this trend has however not been taken into account by local or central governments.

[[[people who are unemployed]]]

[[[ - ]]]The location of job centres causes difficulties for those in rural areas, particularly when Jobcentre Plus offices insist on weekly or daily signing-on and when offices have closed permanently.&#xa0;2.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Those living in rural areas without access to a car face particular difficulties in finding work due to poor transport provision and a lack of affordable social housing located nearer to employment opportunities. Those on low incomes may also be reluctant to move nearer to jobs due to their informal networks of support or family commitments in the area where they currently live.&#xa0;2.11&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Two out of five jobseekers say lack of transport is a barrier to getting a job. The cost of transport can be a problem getting to interviews and transport problems can be a deterrent to making job applications

[[[s – ]]]People on low incomes face similar issues and obstacles to those who are out of work.&#xa0;2.13&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Low income families are more dependent than others on bus travel; buses account for a larger proportion of their income and the cheaper fare deals which involve paying larger lump sums are often unavailable to them. Bus fare increases restrict the ability of households to meet the transport costs of their children for important out of school activities and transport costs can be a barrier to employment for low income families&#xa0;2.14&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; People in the lowest income quintile make three times more journeys by bus than people in the highest income quintile

[[[Transport Isolation]]]

[[[ for people with disabilities]]]

[[[ - ]]]Disabled people are more likely to mention transport as a local concern than non-disabled people, 60 per cent of disabled people have no car in the household and hey use buses around 20 per cent more frequently than non-disabled people.&#xa0;2.16&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Inaccessible transport cuts disabled people off from community and family life.

[[[ ]]]Fifty per cent say they did not see friends and family

[[[ ]]]as often as they’d like because of inaccessible transport and 20% find it difficult or impossible to get the healthcare they need because of inaccessible transport.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1&#xa0;&#xa0; The main challenge to providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities is funding. Since 2010 central Government funding for buses has been cut by 20% and funding for supported bus services has been cut by 20%.

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.2&#xa0;&#xa0; Supply and demand is an issue in isolated communities with a higher cost per passenger journey for the operators. The wider benefits to local economies must be considered when making decisions on local transport.

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.3&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Integrated Transport – ]]]Due to the nature of a privatised rail network and deregulated bus services a huge challenge is getting transport operators to work together to promote integrated transport, which in isolated communities can be vital. &#xa0;3.4&#xa0;&#xa0; Network St Albans was launched in 2009 to bring together all the organisations which have a role to play in providing/improving transport in the city of St Albans, with the aim to reduce traffic congestion. It was St Albans Local Strategic Partnership (LSP) that formed the basis for developing a public transport related partnership to come up with alternatives to single occupancy car use in St Albans.   The negative impacts imposed on the city and wider area from local traffic congestion and pollution (specifically on Pea Hen Junction), needed a strategic approach, which includes improving public transport service provision and infrastructure.&#xa0;3.5&#xa0;&#xa0; Greater integrated transport systems should also be strongly encouraged for isolated areas enabling bus and train operators to work with local authorities to promote cooperation and enabling a greater door to door journey experience from public transport. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.6&#xa0;&#xa0; A study by the Campaign for Better Transport on door to door journeys identified four key points needed for success

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1&#xa0;&#xa0; Community transport can be a lifeline in both rural and urban areas. It takes disabled people to work, children to school, sick people to healthcare and older people to the shops. It runs local bus routes and provides transport for a wide range of clubs, voluntary bodies and care homes. People shape the services they want and community transport makes it happen.

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.2&#xa0;&#xa0; Community Transport schemes serving the most remote corners of the country, or schemes working in partnership with other local services like youth clubs or care homes, can really make a huge difference to people who use them. Community Transport is part of the Transport mix in isolated communities but not the sole solution to passenger transport.

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.3&#xa0;&#xa0; Central Government and Local Authorities are unrealistic if they expect volunteer run community transport projects to fill gaps left by deep bus cuts. Research from the Community Transport Association has shown that community transport can only fill between 10 to 15 per cent of former supported transport provision.&#xa0;4.4&#xa0;&#xa0; The integration of services and pooling for budgets, at both local and national levels, can ensure that public money is made to work harder. Some local authorities have already made savings by integrating the way they contract public bus services, school buses and social services transport. Partnerships between councils, operators and big institutions like hospitals and universities have had good results. Taxi buses, NHS transport, travel schemes for post 16 students and social enterprises all have a part to play. In some cases core routes linking towns are met by demand response village services at request stops. &#xa0;4.5&#xa0;&#xa0; A ‘Total Transport’ solution for areas affected by cuts to services which would bring together all transport provision in an area such as private operators, council run services, hospital transport and social services.&#xa0;4.6&#xa0;&#xa0; Community Rail Partnerships play an important role in providing transport for isolated communities. The case for new or reopened connections is increasingly strong, with demand for rail now at its highest level since before the Second World War, despite the network being considerably smaller than then. Despite the growing case for these connections, there is no clear process in the rail industry for this to happen and many local authorities lack the capacity or skills to progress schemes themselves. Some new lines and stations have been built, however, and demand on these new lines and stations has usually been higher than forecast.

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;5.1&#xa0;&#xa0; It is difficult to say what extent passengers in isolated communities should rely upon taxis as previously described there are many different service users in these areas that all have different needs and requirements. &#xa0;5.2&#xa0;&#xa0; If taxis are used to replace public transport then they should be demand responsive. Can a replacement taxi be adequately used for people in work or education at peak times. How far would this service also booked in advance.&#xa0;5.3&#xa0;&#xa0; There are various Taxi Voucher Schemes in place across a few places in England, most notably in London but also in Surrey, Cheshire, Brighton and Hove for example. Outside London these vouchers amount to around £70 per year on the basis that users give up their National Bus Pass in exchange.&#xa0;6.1&#xa0;&#xa0; A recent Case Study by Campaign for Better Transport of an area in the North East looked at an housing estate where bus cuts had taken place and where the local council had replaced the supported bus service with a residual free bus service to the local supermarket. This study found that that some residents were forced into taking taxi’s but only those who could afford to. &#xa0;6.2&#xa0;&#xa0; Local residents were left isolated causing very serious impacts for many such as leaving the house much less to go shopping, visit friends and family. Financial impacts due to having to travel by taxis, and most seriously, health and social impacts. &#xa0;6.3&#xa0;&#xa0; “A lot of older people than me live around here and especially early morning I relied on this bus service. I can't walk very well, I have a stick so walking far is not an option unless the weather is dry.” (Female, aged 46 to 65, not working and not looking for work, no access to a car, has a disability or ill health)&#xa0;6.4&#xa0;&#xa0; Demand responsive transport can be important for residents in isolated communities. In Simon Norton’s evidence to this committee he highlights the guidelines for good demand responsive service, which include:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;7.1&#xa0;&#xa0; Funding transport services in isolated communities is getting progressively harder and harder with spending cuts across the board since 2010. There must be a greater focus on transport integration and Local Authorities working together with all transport operators. &#xa0;7.2&#xa0;&#xa0; Different modes of transport should be working together not against each other – it should not be a case of bus versus rail. &#xa0;7.3&#xa0;&#xa0; Whilst many argue for spending cuts to transport across the country, there must be a general recognition that investing in passenger transport is good for the country with wider benefits experienced economically, socially and environmentally to having a good transport system. People in isolated communities must not be left behind when budgets are cut and savings are made. &#xa0;7.4&#xa0;&#xa0; A way forward would be to create a ring fenced fund from Central Government for local buses which would pool investment in buses from the Government departments that most benefit from them – DWP, DfE, DH. This would be distributed as now through the Bus Service Operators Grant or through a new approach that supports buses in rural as well as in urban areas based on accessibility.&#xa0;August 2013&#xa0;&#xa0; Transport and Poverty: A Literature Review, Campaign for Better Transport, July 2012, http://www.bettertransport.org.uk/files/transport-and-poverty-literature-review.pdf  Transport barriers to getting a job – Evidence from Citizens Advice clients, Campaign for Better Transport, July 2012, http://www.bettertransport.org.uk/files/Transport-barriers-to-getting-a-job.pdf  Social Inclusion Value of Buses – Marchwood, Social Inclusion Value of Buses – Burbank, Campaign for Better Transport, July 2012, http://www.bettertransport.org.uk/files/social-inclusion-value-of-buses-marchwood-report.pdf and http://www.bettertransport.org.uk/files/social-inclusion-value-of-buses-burbank-report.pdf  http://www.bettertransport.org.uk/files/Crisis-of-bus-provision-in-England.pdf  National Travel Survey Department for Transport, 2009 Information about travel behaviour based on National Travel Survey, Department for Transport, 2009 (DfT) No Entry!
