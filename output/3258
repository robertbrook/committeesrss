[normal]This submission addresses the constitutional role of the judiciary within the UK
[normal] 
[normal]constitution
[normal] and the choices available to the courts – in their vindication of the rule of law – when fa
[normal]ced with ‘unconstitutional’ legislation. It 
[normal]draws on arguments and analysis published 
[normal]in

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Although in practice the system of checks and balances is akin to systems respecting a more formal separation of powers, Britain’s mixed model of government firmly subordinate
[normal]d
[normal] 
[normal]the jud
[normal]iciary
[normal] to the elected branches of government. The constitutional hierarchy, which stems from the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty
[normal],
[normal] conceive
[normal]d of
[normal] the courts as 
[normal]‘modest underworkers’ and ‘handmaids to Parliament’s will’.
[normal] 
[normal]Courts were
[normal] to interpret the tex
[normal]t and to declare the law
[normal],
[normal] and they enjoyed only limited review powers over delegated authority by Parliament to subordinate bodies.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]By adhering to
[normal] plain meaning (literalist/formalist) approaches to statutory interpretation (which 
[normal]avoid 
[normal]the 
[normal]charge 
[normal]that 
[normal]the judiciary might 
[normal]substitut
[normal]e
[normal] its 
[normal]own 
[normal]view of the law for that expressed by Parliamen
[normal]t),
[normal] 
[normal]the judiciary acknowledge that democracy and public policy (i.e. most of effective law-making) 
[normal]are
[normal] 
[normal]generally regarded as political matters to be determined in and by
[normal] the legislature
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The impact 
[normal]of 
[normal]this
[normal] 
[normal]subordination 
[normal]on the constitutional status of the courts 
[normal]has been
[normal] enormous. Between 1842 and the UK’s accession to the European Community in January 1973, not a single case reached the House of Lords on the question 
[normal]of the absence of limitations of Parliament’s ultimate law-making authority.
[normal] The period 
[normal]from World War II until the 1960s ‘marked the depths of the irrelevance of the courts in the development of the constitution
[normal].
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]B: 
[normal]The Development of Powers of 
[normal]Quasi-Constitutional Review:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Developments since the latter 
[normal]decades 
[normal]of the twentieth century have prompted a re-evaluation of the constitutional position of the judiciary as necessarily 
[normal]subservient. 
[normal]Over this period
[normal], and 
[normal]as a cumulative result of the statu
[normal]tory
[normal] 
[normal]conferral and arrogation of powers
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the apex court gradually developed a ‘pronounced public law profile’
[normal] such that the United Kingdom Supreme Court 
[normal](UKSC) 
[normal]can now be seen to 
[normal]discharge ‘some of the functions of a constitutional court’
[normal].
[normal] In the absence
[normal] of a documentary constitution, and in the light of the fact that the sovereignty of Parliament remains of fundamental importance to our understandings of the constitution, it is appropriate to classify these powers of review as quasi-constitutional. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We 
[normal]identif
[normal]y
[normal] two types of powers of quasi-constitutional review. The first type, explicit powers, derives from statute.
[normal]  
[normal]The 
[normal]UKSC
[normal] 
[normal]has been allocated powers of quasi-constitutional review under the European Communities Act 1972
[normal] (ECA)
[normal], the Human Rights Act 1998
[normal] 
[normal](HRA)
[normal], and the UK
[normal]’
[normal]s devolution legislation. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In the context of EU law, Parliament’s competence is substantively limited in two ways: first, it may not legislate contrary to EU law (s.2(4) EC
[normal]A
[normal] 1972); and second, courts enjoy power to ‘disapply’ national la
[normal]w to the extent that it is inconsistent with directly effective provisions of EU law.
[normal] It is acting in this capacity that the 
[normal]UKSC
[normal] 
[normal]most clearly discharges functions akin to
[normal] the
[normal] strong form
[normal] 
[normal]judicial review
[normal] exercised by Supreme and Constitutional Courts else
[normal]where
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]HRA
[normal] review gives rise to consequences of a slightly different order
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]permitting
[normal] courts to interpret primary legislation in order to achieve compliance with the Convention Rights so far as it is possible to do so
[normal] (s.3(1) HRA)
[normal],
[normal] or in the alternative providing for the issue of a declaration of incompatibility
[normal] (s.4 HRA)
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Though neither option permits the court to mount a direct challenge to the legality of an Act of Parliament, the 
[normal]HRA
[normal] nonetheless empowers the 
[normal]courts
[normal] 
[normal]to
[normal] test prima
[normal]ry legislation
[normal],
[normal] whenever enacted
[normal],
[normal] for compliance with human rights standards
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]courts
[normal] 
[normal]also 
[normal]exercise power
[normal] to determine legal disputes relating to ‘devolution issues’ 
[normal]arising 
[normal]out of the 
[normal]transfer of legal powers to 
[normal]devolved bodies
[normal].
[normal] The power of the 
[normal]UKSC
[normal] 
[normal]– previously exercised by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council – is something of a departure from the traditional distinction placed by the constitution on the review of executive and legislative action, in the devolved context potentially subjectin
[normal]g 
[normal]both
[normal] to judicial review. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sovereignty-respecting measures are evident in both the 
[normal]HRA 
[normal]and in the devolution legislation. The 
[normal]HRA 
[normal]stipulates that neither the interpretation of legislation under s.3(1) nor the issue of a declaration of incompatibility un
[normal]der s.4 will affect the ‘validity, continuing operation or enforcement’ of the legislative provision(s) under review. The scheme of the devolution legislation, meanwhile, subjects only devolved legislation to potential review, and contains measures designe
[normal]d to preserve the sovereignty of the Westminster Parliament.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]In addition to those powers of quasi-constitutional review allocated by statute, the expansion of the judicial review jurisdiction (and thereby of the constitutional powers of the courts exist
[normal]ent at common law) has seen the development of implied powers of quasi-constitutional review by the judges themselves.  At the most straightforward level, 
[normal]a judicial belief in the 
[normal]‘
[normal]sanctity
[normal]’
[normal] of statutory language has yielded ground to more generous and purposive techni
[normal]ques of construction
[normal].
[normal]  Rather more fundamentally, the development of ideas associated with the ‘common law constitution’
[normal] – including t
[normal]he 
[normal]incremental 
[normal]development of a body of ‘
[normal]constitutional rights’
[normal] 
[normal]and the 
[normal]acknowledge
[normal]ment of a distinction 
[normal]between constitutional
[normal] and non-constitutional
[normal] 
[normal]statutes
[normal] – 
[normal]have
[normal] 
[normal]exposed the traditional positivist and sovereignty-driven explanation of the constitution as being 
[normal]inadequate.
[normal] The effects of th
[normal]is transition, which 
[normal]saw common law standards
[normal] (as opposed to the inferred intent of Parliament) as underpinning the courts’ regulatory function
[normal],
[normal] have been described as ‘one of the most fundamental realignments of the constitutional order since the end of 
[normal]the seventeenth century’.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The high watermark of this line of 
[normal]common law 
[normal]reasoning
[normal] remains
[normal] Lord Hoffmann
[normal]’s articulation of the ‘principle of legality’
[normal] in 
[normal]R
[normal] v. 
[normal]Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Simms
[normal].
[normal]  Via the controlling mechanism of
[normal] the common law, Hoffmann addresses one of the most controversial and divisive issues in contemporary public law discourse; the tension between the legal controls imposed by the rule of law and the theoretically limitless legal power
[normal] of
[normal] Parliament.  On the
[normal] one hand,
[normal] 
[normal]Hoffmann is at pains to preserve the ability of Parliament to legislate contrary to fundamental individual rights.  On the other, 
[normal]he asserts that 
[normal]the constitutional function of the common law has 
[normal]expanded 
[normal]so as to 
[normal]subject primary legislation to 
[normal]a degree of legal control.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]We conclude 
[normal]that in certain clearly-
[normal]defined areas of law, the UKSC 
[normal]already
[normal] acts as a constitutional organ. It exercises quasi-constitutional powers in relation to the European Union and 
[normal]under 
[normal]the 
[normal]HRA
[normal] 
[normal]a
[normal]nd acts as a quasi-federal court in 
[normal]devolution cases. Hoffmann notes in 
[normal]Simms
[normal] that the apex court in the UK is empowered to ‘
[normal]apply principles of constitutionality little different from those which exist in countries where the power of the legislature is 
[normal]expressly limited by a constitutional document
[normal].’
[normal] This, however, overstates the point in relation to cases that fall outside the above areas of law.  Clear legislative 
[normal]intent remains 
[normal]of 
[normal]unquestionable 
[normal]authority
[normal]. The most the common law empowerment allows t
[normal]he judges to do is to require express or unambiguous words where Parliament wishes to override fundamental rights or the rule of law.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]C: 
[normal]The power of review in constitutional cases
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]That t
[normal]he rule of law is one of the twin fundamentals on which the consti
[normal]tution rests
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]is acknowledged by scholars
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]judges
[normal] and primary legislation
[normal] and the sense that it is the role of the court to vindicate the rule of law has animated the incremental expansion of the judicial role since the mid-twentieth century.
[normal]  Yet, as
[normal] Hoffmann’s analysis reveals, it is the supremacy of Parliament that ranks first among these supposed equals. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Any future determination of the respective constitutional role and function of the judiciary must then seek to address the tension between the s
[normal]overeignty of 
[normal]Parliament and the rule of law
[normal] by approaching them as equals
[normal].  
[normal]A further formalisation of the relationship between Parliament and courts should examine how to make good the constitutional commitment to both democratic government and the rule of law.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]We argue that the development of the constitutional function of th
[normal]e courts has rendered the 
[normal]traditional
[normal] understanding of the 
[normal]necessarily 
[normal]subordinate role of the courts obsolete. Unquestioning acceptance by the courts of legislative direction – however Draconian – may no longer be taken for granted under this new constitu
[normal]tional equilibrium
[normal]:
[normal] the ‘respect to be shown to the considered judgment of a democratic assembly’ is no longer a matter of assumption and ‘will vary according to the subject matter and the circumstances.’
[normal] Equally, however, the argument that the 
[normal]UKSC 
[normal]shoul
[normal]d extend its brief and assert the ability to strike down legislation would be a clear usurpation of the powers of the legislature.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Possible judicial responses to Parliament doing the ‘unthinkable’
[normal] 
[normal]– for instance, passing legislation that disenfranchise
[normal]d a substantial proportion of the population on arbitrary grounds
[normal] or insulated vast tranches of governmental activity from the scrutiny of the courts
[normal] – 
[normal]tend to be couched in 
[normal]abstract 
[normal]terms and are
[normal] often
[normal] countered with a straightforward re-assertion of 
[normal]th
[normal]e sovereignty of Parliament.
[normal] 
[normal]We argue that there are three legitimate judicial responses in constitutional cases, each occupying a position between uncritical, literal application of parliamentary intent and judicial enforcement of a substantive rule of l
[normal]aw.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]19.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The most robust course available to the court draws inspiration from the seminal decision in 
[normal]Anisminic
[normal] v. 
[normal]Foreign Compensation Commission
[normal].
[normal]  In the exceptional case of a clash between constitutional fundamentals, the 
[normal]Anisminic
[normal] decision might be depl
[normal]oyed in order to support the reinstatement of a jurisdiction apparently ousted by statute, or – read more broadly – prevent the attempted insulation by statute of otherwise 
[normal]ultra
[normal] 
[normal]vires
[normal] activity from judicial review.  While falling short of US-style constit
[normal]utional review, the possibility of this form of judicial disobedience to primary legislation remains the most potent weapon available to the UKSC in the event of a fundamental constitutional clash. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Sitting below outright disobedience, in legal terms at l
[normal]east, would be the judicial articulation of a ‘declaration of unconstitutionality.’  Drawing inspiration from declarations of incompatibility under the HRA 1998, David Jenkins has argued that the courts possess the inherent power to declare Acts of Parliam
[normal]ent to be unconstitutional ‘when Parliament legislates against legal norms or fundamental baselines for political behaviour deemed by courts of special significance within Britain’s unwritten constitution.’
[normal] Such declarations, Jenkins argues, would respect
[normal]ful of sovereignty in two ways.  First, they would be ‘nonbinding and not affect the legal validity’ of the statute in respect of which they were made.
[normal]  Second, ‘the declaration openly recognizes Parliament’s exercise of sovereign power within (or, one mi
[normal]ght say, against) an accepted constitutional context.’
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]21.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Judicial disobedience would pose the most obvious threat to Parliament’s authority by rendering subsequent applications of the legislation contingent on the court’s disobedient response (though legis
[normal]lative restoration, or refinement, of the disputed provision would remain a possibility). The consequences of the issue of a ‘declaration of unconstitutionality’ would not be so severe.  A legislative response to such a declaration might result from the po
[normal]litical damage caused by the interpretative authority attached to the judicial reading of the requirements of the 
[normal]constitution, but would not be an inevitability.  The impugned statute would remain operable.  The declaration of unconstitutionality would, t
[normal]herefore, better straddle the principle of judicial control and the principle of legislative supremacy, and offer greater respect to the political underpinnings of the UK constitution. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]22.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Finally, the courts may in certain constitutional cases need to softe
[normal]n the letter of the law in order to achieve fairness in individual cases
[normal] and to vindicate the judicial presumption that 
[normal]Parliament legislates ‘for a European liberal democracy’ in compliance with fundamental principles
[normal].
[normal] Like equity, which ‘mitigates the r
[normal]igour of the common law’,
[normal] the rule of law ensures that 
[normal]the formal legal doctrine of 
[normal]Parliamentary sovereignty does not lose sight of constitutional principles that are of fundamental importance in individual circumstances. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]23.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The rule of law requires court
[normal]s to interpret an Act of Parliament 
[normal]while
[normal] ensur
[normal]ing
[normal] that its application does not result in unfairness in speciﬁc cases. Attempts to reconcile parliamentary intent with the requirements of the rule of law are a less dramatic and a more realistic and workabl
[normal]e suggestion than the conferral of a general discretion on the courts to disapply unconstitutional and pernicious 
[normal]legislation
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]24.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The courts share in the task of policing the boundaries of a rights-based democracy with the legislature and executive
[normal];
[normal] 
[normal]their role is complementary to that of Parliament, and of the executive. 
[normal] 
[normal]To classify
[normal] the
[normal] quasi-
[normal]constitutional function
[normal]s
[normal] of the 
[normal]courts 
[normal]as a step towards judicial supremacism is to deny the distinctive functions of the legislative and judicial branches: ‘[c
[normal]]
[normal]ourts do not substitute Parliament in the making of policy decisions as they are limited by the principle of institutional integrity: “[t]here is a Rubicon which they may not cross.”’
[normal] It also denies the crucial constitutional role of the courts in their 
[normal]habitual recognition of Parliament as sovereign.
[normal] The constitutional functions and authority of the courts, therefore, form the embodiment of the balanced constitution in its modern incarnation.
