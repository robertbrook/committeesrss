default 
defaultThe Chairman:default Good afternoon and welcome. Thank you very much for giving the time to help us as witnesses in our study on youth unemployment. 
defaultF
defaultirst of all, the session is broadcast live. The session will last approximately 60 minutes and 
defaultm
defaultembers of the Committee with relevant interests will declare these now. 
defaultAre there a
defaultny relevant interests? No
default. T
defaulthank you. The session is on the record and is being webcast live and will be subsequently accessible via the parliamentary website. You will all receive a transcript of the session to check and correct. This will be put on the public record in printed form and on the parliamentary website. Now I would like to ask each of you if you could begin by stating for the record your names and official titles. This is for the benefit of our transcribers.
defaultNarmada Thiranagamadefault: 
defaultNarmada
default Thiranagama, Policy Officer in the Policy Unit at UNISON.
defaultJohn Wastnagedefault: John Wastnage, Head of Employment and Skills at the British Chambers of Commerce.
defaultRichard Exelldefault: Richard Exell, Senior Policy Officer at the Trades Union Congress.
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you. Would any of you or all of you like to make an opening statement?
defaultRichard Exelldefault: I have a very brief opening statement.
defaultThe Chairman:default Good.
defaultRichard Exelldefault: We are grateful to have this opportunity to give evidence to the inquiry. We think it is important to take a broader perspective on the employment issues that everyone comments about all the time. In particular, we think it is worth noting that by European standards the 
defaultUK
default’s employment performance since the recession has been about the average. It is so much better than previous recessions
default that 
defaultwe have all been rather dazzled by that fact, but that has been quite a common experience. 
defaultUK
default youth employment levels are about the EU average as well, both post and pre
default 
defaultrecession, so an inquiry that is looking at youth unemployment in a European context is well overdue.
defaultJohn Wastnagedefault: Our main experience is very focused on the 
defaultUK
default rather than the EU, but we likewise are very grateful for the opportunity to give evidence. We think that this is an important inquiry and 
defaultthat 
defaultthere are some lessons from the 
defaultUK
default labour market for other parts of the European Union, but we also take quite a humble approach to skills and employment. We recognise it is a very complex area. There are no quick fixes. There are not simple solutions. It is an area of policy that really benefits from as much dialogue and co-operation as possible.
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you for that. Of course, I understand that you are looking at the UK, but we are part of the 28 
defaultM
defaultember 
defaultS
defaulttates of the European Union. The purpose of doing this inquiry is that we will be able to 
defaulttell 
defaultour negotiators
default the results
default,
default 
defaultand 
defaultput the results into Brussels as well, 
defaultto 
defaulthelp negotiate the 
defaultD
defaultirectives that will follow and 
defaultto 
defaultbring some light
default—and hope, I hope—
defaultinto the subject. Whatever experience you have in the 
defaultUK
default is invaluable. Do not decry it.
defaultJohn Wastnagedefault: Yes.
defaultNarmadadefault Thiranagamadefault: I would just like to add to other comments by saying that 
defaultthis
default is not just about unemployment, it is also about the kind of employment young people are now entering into
default. It is 
defaulta problem shared by many other people in the workforce, 
defaultand it is 
defaultlow
default-
defaultpaid, insecure employment. 
defaultWe are 
defaultparticularly 
defaultconcerned about this 
defaultissue for young people because of the long-term impact it will have on their lives. Cycling in and out of insecure work will continue to have an effect 
defaultnot only 
defaulton their life prospects but 
defaulton 
defaultthe 
defaultUK
default’s wider economy. At UNISON, we represent young members but we also have a concern for youth unemployment. It is a double-facing issue for us. When our young members report
default that
default they have the same 
defaultworries 
defaultabout their job insecurity, increasing stress at work, the inability to have enough to live on, that is another dimension to our 
defaultviews on the 
defaultkind of work young people are getting.
defaultThe Chairman:default Can you just clarify one point for me? 
defaultAre your
default UNISON younger members in jobs
default? T
defaulthey are not unemployed?
defaultNarmadadefault Thiranagamadefault: Yes.
defaultThe Chairman:default But they still feel that they are in low-paid insecure jobs with no hope?
defaultNarmadadefault Thiranagamadefault: 
defaultT
defaulthey are very worried about their jobs. Anecdotally, 
defaultand this is 
defaultnot just 
defaultthe case 
defaultwith 
defaultthe 
defaultyoung members we work with, even when they get a foot into the labour market
default and 
defaultget decent jobs, even paid jobs, because of cutbacks, because of budget issues, they are always worrying about how long a job will last
default. There is 
defaulttemporary work
default and 
defaultshort-term opportunities only. That is something our young members say to us.
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you very much for that clarification.
defaultQ71 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Freeman:default Good afternoon. I think the Committee understands that youth unemployment is a serious aspect of the current economic problems that are faced throughout the European Union
default, but t
defaulthe Committee would like to understand what is particular and different 
defaultabout
default youth unemployment from previous recessions. In other words, is there a modal shift? Is there something specific that we should be focusing on? Perhaps you could comment, therefore, 
defaulton 
defaultwhat you are most worried about in this particular economic cycle and the effect on youth unemployment.
defaultRichard Exelldefault: We see important similarities with previous major recessions. The one thing that has changed in an important way is the way in which we need to talk about youth unemployment nowadays. Because of the large increase in participation in education and training by people over 16 and under 25 over the last 20 years, simply focusing on unemployment rates tells us less about what is happening to young people now than it did when we were talking about the 1990s recession. Our favoured measure for discussions about the problems faced by young people is not quite the NEET statistics
default; i
defaultt is the proportion who are not in employment or full-time education or training
default—
defaultthe proportion of the whole age group. If you look at that measure, the similarity to the last major recession is quite significant. What you have in a short space of time 
defaultis 
defaulta significant increase in the proportion of young people not in employment or education. The difference is what happens after that peak is reached. 
defaultIn t
defaulthe 1990s recession, we had a very 
defaults
defaultlow falling back of the proportion of young people without a job or an education place. We did not get back to p
defaultre
default-
defaultrecession levels until 1997-
default98.
defaultT
defaulthis time round, first of all the recovery from the recession started more quickly. Youth employment and the proportion who had neither a job nor an education place started recovering quickly
default. The 
defaultother labour market indicators 
defaultstarted
default deteriorating in 2010, 
defaultand 
defaultcontinued like that in 2011, but for the last couple of years we have had quite a rapid improvement. From a high point of about 20.5%—just over a fifth of young people did not have a job or an education or training place a couple of years ago—we are already down to 18.2%
default, so it 
defaultis coming down 
defaultby
default 
defaultabout 1% a year at the moment, 
defaultwhich 
defaultis pretty good.
defaultWe had some research carried out for us recently that showed that the proportion of young people in low-paid jobs, 
defaultwhich 
defaultNarmada
default was 
defaulttalking 
defaultabout just now, has increased over the last 20 years. Our research compared the situation in 1993 with the situation in 2011
default and 
defaultfound that the proportion of young workers in low-paid jobs was substantially higher than it had been then. We are also getting from our young members’ forum, from the young members in affiliates like UNISON, reports about insecurity of work. Lots and lots of union officers are reporting back to us concerns about young people in particular being affected by things like the zero-hours contracts.
defaultOur major concern about this recession as opposed to previous ones is more a matter of the quality of the jobs of the people who do get back into employment. That is a serious worry. 
defaultT
defaulthe level of unemployment
default,
default or the level of people who are not in employment or education
default,
default has been a bit bumpy
default,
default but it does seem to be improving at the moment. Sorry, that was a bit longwinded.
defaultThe Chairman:default No, that is fine.
defaultJohn Wastnagedefault: 
defaultO
defaultne of the main differences with this economic crisis or period of lower growth is its duration. One of the things that causes youth unemployment to rise faster during periods of low economic growth than among other demographics is the flow of young people into the labour market. There is a higher flow of young people than 
defaultof 
defaultother age groups because of each successive year of people leaving education and entering the labour market for the first time. Each additional year that demand is reduced in employment has a disproportionate effect on youth unemployment. That is one of the major differences.
defaultW
defaulte have also seen some quite large structural changes in how the labour market functions. Richard talked about things like increases in low-paid work and zero-hours contracts, although I would suggest that zero-hours contracts may be benefiting young people and helping them to get into the labour market. We see take-up higher among young people and older workers, and they are two groups that we know at times can find it hard to find work. Perhaps giving employers that extra flexibility can aid employment for those groups. I would be concerned about any proposals to end zero-hours contracts, although I do not think 
defaultthat 
defaultmany people are really proposing that
default. It is 
defaultmore reforming how they work.
defaultWe saw the end of the default retirement age. We do not have a problem with people working longer as lives increase, but one advantage about having a default retirement age, even if it were at an older age, is that employers are better able to plan for succession of skills. If you have just one role doing a highly skilled job, you may bring in an apprentice for two or three years to learn the skills of someone who has been with you for 30 or 40 years and to take over that role. If you do not know when that older worker is going to retire, it is much harder to plan for that. That has probably not had a major effect, but it is certainly a change.
defaultSomething we find quite interesting when we poll our members is that even during this period of high unemployment when they ought to find it fairly easy to find the right member of staff, 40% tell us that they struggle to find the right member of staff for roles when they advertise. There is obviously a disconnect between the skills and experience of those people in the labour market or how they are presenting themselves and what employers are looking for. We also polled employers about their attitudes towards different groups within the labour market. Just to illustrate one point of concern, even for graduates, employers felt more confident about recruiting gradu
defaultates than they did those with A-
defaultlevels or equivalents or those who left school without any qualifications
default,
default but only 41% of employers felt confident 
defaultabout 
defaultrecruiting graduates. That is not quite as stark as it may sound.
defaultQ72 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default Can you just clarify why it is only 41%?
defaultJohn Wastnagedefault: I think some of it is in how the question was asked. 
defaultA 
defaultgeneral question, “How confident do you feel recruiting graduates?”
default,
default is very different 
defaultfrom
default, “How confident do you feel recruiting the graduate sat in front of you with appropriate skills and experiences?”
default, but 
defaultit does illustrate that employers are not concerned primarily with qualifications per se
default; i
defaultt is that skills and experiences have to be relevant to the job and that an individual applying for work should be able to show that they can add value to the organisation.
defaultThe other thing I probably should have said in my opening statement is that when we talk about youth unemployment and concerns about employability of young people, it is very easy to tar the whole age group. That is certainly not what we hear from employers. 
defaultEmployers 
defaultare concerned about the situation at the moment because they 
defaultreally 
defaultvalue young people in their businesses and they want to recruit them. They are very aware of what young people can add to a business, and most young people have a lot of skills to offer and are very employable. Nonetheless, the minority who find themselves in a position where they are going to struggle to find work is too high.
defaultThe Chairman:default Lord Freeman, is there anything else you wanted to ask?
defaultLord Freeman:default No.
defaultNarmadadefault Thiranagamadefault: 
defaultI will, if I may, 
defaultquickly add 
defaultto that. 
defaultI think one of the reasons why it is particularly unlucky to enter the labour market when there is a recession, and it is 
defaulthas been a marked 
defaultphenomenon in 
defaultthe 
defaultresearch looking at this, is because you are then predisposed to getting certain kinds of jobs
default and to 
defaultaccepting lower wages
default and 
defaultmore insecure employment. This then predisposes you throughout your life to being stuck in that kind of work
default. T
defaulthe chance has then become higher. One of the reasons why we are concerned about the impact on young people at the moment is because of the long-term effects of this.
defaultI
defaultn terms of the skills that young people bring and employer attitudes, the UKCES 
defaultsurveyed 
defaultemployers who had hired young people and their experiences of hiring young people. Two-thirds of the employers who had recruited a young person who had only completed compulsory education and therefore 
defaultdid 
defaultnot 
defaulthave 
defaulta degree found them to be well or very well prepared for work. This was even higher for people who had more qualifications.
defaultA
default percentage
default—3.4%—of employers
default found young people ill-prepared, especially in literacy and numeracy. I was surprised to read that 
defaultit 
defaultwas such a small figure
default,
default given some of the more anecdotal evidence. I wonder whether perceptions about young people and stereotypes about them hold stronger, especially if you are not working with them or if you have not hired someone recently and found your experience of that individual to be quite different. I would say that there is a bit of a gap between what that survey found and some of the reports 
defaultthat 
defaultwe see in the public discourse about young people
default and their 
defaultliteracy
default,
default numeracy and preparedness. 
defaultActually, t
defaulthe biggest reason why employers were reluctant to hire young people was their lack of experience, which is something they cannot overcome.
defaultThe Chairman:default Yes, but how can they get experience if they are not going to be employed? It is ridiculous.
defaultQ73 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Haskel:default This is the point that I wanted to ask. It is a chicken and egg situation. Mr Wastnage was saying that there is a shortage of people
default: that 
defaultemployers are finding there is a shortage. On the other hand, they are saying that people were not experienced and skilled. Of course, that is what young people are; they are inexperienced. Surely it is up to the employer as well to make an effort to give them the experience to bring on their skills so that they become of value to the company.
defaultJohn Wastnagedefault: Just to answer the point about the UKCES survey, it is a slightly selective group in that the very nature of the fact that the employer had hired that individual means 
defaultthat 
defaultit is more likely that they would have been satisfied with them. It does not include the group who were not hired.
defaultThe Chairman:default Yes, indeed.
defaultJohn Wastnagedefault: That is something to bear in mind. Nonetheless, I think there is a perception gap
default,
default and the more employers have contact with young people the more confident they feel about recruiting them. Likewise, the more contact young people have with employers and the more experience they get
default,
default the more employable they become. Yes, we would like to see employers play a greater role. There is quite a stark divide between employers who understand the value of investing in skills and particularly young people and understand that that is crucial to the future growth and survival of their business, and businesses that perhaps just do not have time for it or are too busy running their business and they never quite get round to the strategic questions.
defaultLord Haskel:default Or rely on poaching.
defaultJohn Wastnagedefault: Or rely on poaching. 
defaultThe Chairman:default That is another point: get somebody else to train them.
defaultJohn Wastnagedefault: 
defaultThat is also a problem that we hear about. 
defaultIt can put off other employers from investing in training. We need not rely solely on employers hiring young people after they finish their education in order to give them experience of the workplace. One of the other big changes we have seen is the decline in Saturday jobs and work
default experience. This Government have
default not taken the most active approach to encouraging work experience in schools
default,
default and that is something we would like to see changed. We support some of the changes that the education sector has made: the focus on rigour in the education system, continued focus on numeracy and literacy and a continued focus on apprenticeships, but we would like to see a greater focus on contact between young people and employers through work experience placements, not necessarily the standard one or two-week placement at a certain age but perhaps mixing it up, 
defaulthaving 
defaulteven half days in a business, a couple of days a year later, and perhaps a week a year after that.
defaultRichard Exelldefault: 
defaultI
defaultt is not all bleak, Chair. We may have seen a decline in Saturday jobs, but if you think about young people’s employment experience, the biggest change over the last 20 years is the way it has become the norm for people in post-compulsory education to combine that with paid work, even with full-time paid work in some cases. 
defaultA
default surprisingly large number of young people in the labour force survey say 
defaultthat 
defaultthey are both in full-time education and in full-time employment.
defaultOne advantage of being the oldest person at this table is that I have been following this sort of debate for quite a while. For as long as I can remember, which goes back to the late 1960s, employers have been saying that they are getting young people who are not ready for the world of work, who do not understand basic English, whose maths is not good enough. This is not a sign of a situation that is getting worse. I am all for employer-centred employment policy, but sometimes employers need to take a bit of responsibility for what their responsibility
default is
default. One of their responsibilities is socialising young people into the world of work. You cannot expect someone who has never had a job to be job ready, and part of what decent businesses do is get young people ready for the demands of the world of work
default; you 
defaultare not going to be able to tell customers, “My essay is in the post”
default,
default and so on. It is an important role and we should value it, but we should not allow people to try to get out of it either.
defaultQ74 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Kakkar:default I just want to see 
defaultwhether 
defaultI have understood correctly. There is a discussion around whether the types of jobs that are being created 
defaultand 
defaultthe nature of contracts and so on 
defaultare 
defaultdetrimental to the long-term future of young people now entering the workplace. That seems to be one part of the argument. Another part of the argument is that it is very important to create jobs so that young people entering the workplace have experience of work. I am just unclear about where that balance should be and whether 
defaultthe 
defaultjobs 
defaultthat are 
defaultbeing created on such things as zero-hours contracts are really detrimental
default,
default or whether in fact they offer a real opportunity because employers feel at a time of economic crisis they can create some form of employment and work that gives young people the opportunity to enter the workplace and gain experience.
defaultRichard Exelldefault: There is a very long answer to that
default,
default so I will try to give you the brief answer, which is that it depends on whether you are talking about someone who is in a vulnerable labour market position or someone who comes to the labour market with some strengths behind them. For people who can to some extent choose the jobs that they go for, zero-hours contracts and other forms of flexibility may well provide something that is in their interest.
defaultWhen it comes to young people, especially those with low qualifications who have, as Narmada was saying, fewer job offers, the zero-hours contract 
defaultsupposedly 
defaultgives either the employer the freedom to say, “Oh, 
defaultno, I do not need you now”, 
defaultor you to say, “Oh, no, I do not feel like doing that shift now”. 
defaultBut i
defaultf you are in a position where the worry is that if you say no now you will never be offered another contract, a zero-hours contract means something completely different to you from, say, someone with high-level professional qualifications who can say, “I am going to my cousin’s wedding because I know 
defaultI will get 
defaultanother job 
defaultthat 
defaultwill be 
defaultcoming along soon”.
defaultWhat is particularly worrying—and I was really struck by what Narmada was saying just now—for people whose first experience of the labour market is being vulnerable in that sort of situation of extreme flexibility
default is that i
defaultt makes it more difficult for them to build up the experience and qualifications that put them in a position of strength. It is like starting off down the wrong road. Now we are in a situation where we have more jobs than we expected
default,
default given the depth of the recession. That has to be great, but it is still not as good as having decent jobs.
defaultQ75 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Fearn:default To what extent do you see 
defaultthat 
defaultyoung people’s difficulty in finding and keeping jobs is to do with the supply side—their skills and employability—and to what extent is it to do with the demand side, i.e. the number and types of jobs that are available?
defaultJohn Wastnagedefault: I think it is both, unfortunately, particularly at the moment. We know that there 
defaulthas been 
defaultreduced demand in the economy in recent years. There are also questions about the types of jobs that are being created
default and 
defaultthe skill levels, as my two colleagues have highlighted. 
defaultC
defaultertainly
default we
default, as the British Chambers of Commerce, are working with businesses to support them to think a bit more strategically about their business
default and 
defaultabout how they can sell value-added products and services at higher skill levels and create more highly skilled jobs. To some extent, you have to make sure that the demand is there before you start increasing the supply of high-skilled workers. I think that has got a bit out of kilter in recent years. There is certainly some work to be done on the demand side and that will continue even as economic growth increases.
defaultOn 
defaultthe supply side, I cannot have a conversation about any aspect of skills without employers coming back to concerns about too many young people 
defaultwho
default they encounter. That includes putting aside a day to interview and having none of the candidates turn up, which is something I hear fairly regularly. It is not just an extreme example, although it sounds like one.
defaultThe lack of careers education information, advice and guidance in schools is disgraceful. We rely on individuals to make decisions about their skills training based on their future opportunities, and yet do nothing to equip them with the information and data about the labour market and the opportunities they are likely to encounter to make those informed decisions about their future. We should not be surprised when there is a mismatch between the skills that people are learning and the skills that are in demand. We would like to see a much more thorough system of careers education, not just half an hour or being sat in front of a piece of computer software at age 16 but starting from a much younger age group
default,
default talking about why people work, what different types of jobs there are, what employers value, meeting different types of employers, what the local labour market looks like, what the businesses are within half a mile of the school and so on, and trying to foster some commercial thinking as well as academic thinking, helping young people who have an interest in enterprise to pursue that interest, but also making sure that employers have an influence into the types of skills and attitudes that are fostered in schools.
defaultQ76 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default That is fascinating. Can I ask you 
defaultwhether 
defaultyou do any of that? Is it always somebody else’s job? You obviously have the right focus on things that kids from the age of 11 or something would probably pick up. 
defaultH
defaultere in the House of Lords we have an outreach programme to schools 
defaulton 
defaultdemocracy and the structure of Parliament and all the rest of it
default. I am 
defaultnot suggesting 
defaultthat 
defaultany of them should join us
default—
defaultthey are far too young for that
default—
defaultbut they seem to lap it up, they really do. It just struck me now listening to you 
defaultthat 
defaultsomebody ought to be doing that. 
defaultI
defaults
default i
defaultt
default always somebody else’s job
default?
default Could the unions
default,
default or some group like that
default,
default or trade associations do it? 
defaultJohn Wastnagedefault: The British Chambers of Commerce are ideally placed
default,
default and we are very happy to work with the unions. I started with my opening statement by saying that we take quite a humble approach and we think this is an area where co-operation would be particularly useful. We have a front door in every major town and city around the country. There are 54 accredited chambers of commerce. More than half of them, in fact close to two-thirds of them, have schools, colleges
default and 
defaultuniversities as members and work actively with schools. Last year we delivered 4,000 apprenticeships across the country as training providers.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultT
defaulthat is great, so increase it, multiply.
defaultJohn Wastnagedefault: Yes, we would like to.
defaultThe Chairman:default It just suddenly struck me.
defaultLord Fearn:default What does UNISON think of that?
defaultNarmadadefault Thiranagamadefault: We agree
default,
default and I would echo 
defaultthe point about 
defaultthe importance of careers advice. Before I come on to talk about what UNISON 
defaultis 
defaultdoing 
defaultitself 
defaultfor young people, I just wanted to touch upon careers advice and say that young people who know where they are going when they leave school, i.e. to university, do not have any problems finding out information about what they should be doing nex
defaultt—
defaultThe Chairman:default That is very true.
defaultNarmadadefault Thiranagamadefault: —whereas the less you know about what you are going to do next the more complicated and difficult it is to find out where you are going. Funding for 
defaultConnexions
default and careers advice has just been drastically cut and it is now being left to schools themselves to deliver this. There are increasing concerns that
default,
default at exactly the wrong moment
default,
default instead of it being improved it is being cut back.
defaultRichard can talk more about what the TUC does, which includes talking to young people in schools about the world of work. I think there is a programme called trade unions in the classroom. We have just started a pilot as an employer ourselves with young people
default,
default in the area where our headquarters is based
default,
default 
defaulton 
defaultapprenticeships. These are apprenticeships that conform to the very best practice that the TUC and UNISON believe all apprentices should have. It is starting as a pilot but obviously, once we see how that goes, this is just the start. We also work as a union with employers to support young people and to develop good
default-
defaultquality apprenticeships. This extends from signing agreements at national level with employers to build apprenticeship programmes 
defaultto 
defaultnegotiating what we think are the best quality experiences for young people and the support that they would need. We also do it at our local branch level with individual employers.
defaultJust to give an example, we have just signed a union learning agreement with NHS Property Services. It gives a framework to identify and organise workplace learning for all staff. One of our health branches, Sefton, together with 
defaultits
default employer Aintree 
defaulth
defaultospital, has done some award-winning work due to 
defaulttheir 
defaultwork on apprenticeships together. We have also just started gathering the stories of young people who have been taken on as apprentices through UNISON working with employers. The feedback we get from our activists who have been involved in this work is that it benefits everyone. It benefits us as a union
default, i
defaultt benefits the employers
default, i
defaultt benefits the young people who had that experience.
defaultThe young apprentices also benefit from the trade union voice in many ways. Those who do become a member of the union—they do not have to—get involved with the union’s networks and thus gain other skills that are important to the world of work as well. One of them said that one of the benefits he got was the wide experience, the broader outlook and the ability to network with people his own age, which you 
defaultmight
default not always get 
defaultjust 
defaultwithin that one workplace. I will stop there. I have a lot more. I could talk about that for
default 
defaultever but I will stop there.
defaultQ77 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Clinton-Davis:default How best do you think that employers’ organisations and trade unions can influence policies, particularly in 
defaultEurope
default but also domestically? Do you think that we have any lessons to learn from others in 
defaultEurope
default as well? Finally, it is a fact, is it not, that only some 8% of young people are represented in trade unions? Regrettable 
defaultthough 
defaultI think that is, it is a fact.
defaultRichard Exelldefault: Yes. To some extent, of course, that is not a new issue. Young people have always been less likely to join a union than older workers
default, p
defaultartly because young people very often do not regard their job as permanent. If they have gripes about it, their response is going to be far more the free 
defaultmarket ideal of moving
default on to another one rather than try
defaulting
default to kick up a fuss to improve the standards in the one they are doing at the moment. It has always been the case that people who did not join a union at first become more likely to join as they get older.
defaultHowever, if I had stopped there that would be complacent. The fact is that despite that continuing reality, each new generation has been less likely to join a union than preceding generations at whatever age. We are making substantial efforts to combat that. We work jointly with the National Union of Students on issues that are going to be of interest to young people before they come into the workplace. We have
default the schools outreach programme, which 
defaultNarmada
default was talking about
default, to get
default trades unionists to talk to classrooms about why unions are there for workers. The TUC produces
default learning materials about trade
default unionism for use in schools and colleges. I spend a fair amount of my time advising students on their degree or sometimes even post-graduate essays. Indeed, we respond to requests from colleges, schools and individual teachers quite frequently.
defaultWe also think that it is important for unions to have a higher profile within the community. We do some work in community organising. One of our unions, Unite, has a community branch now, which campaigns on issues outside the workplace, and more and more of our other unions are starting to do community activities like that. We have about two dozen unemployed workers’ centres around the country. We used to have a lot more, but in the 1990s, unfortunately, a lot of the sources of funding for them died out. In particular, I would emphasise our work on learning. There are quite a few young working class people w
defaulthose first encounter with trade
default unionism is when their union helps them to get qualifications later in life.
defaultLord Clinton-Davis:default I wonder whether the position that you describe has deteriorated, not changed or is better than before.
defaultRichard Exelldefault: In some respects 
defaultit is 
defaultworse. We have fewer activists to go to schools, for instance, than we used to have. However, there are other aspects. 
defaultN
defaultow is the most exciting tim
defaulte there has ever been for trade
default unionists on the learning agenda. At Congress House, where I work, getting on for half the staff work for Unionlearn, our learning arm, which is about extending the union presence into bargaining over skills. We have trained 30,000 union learning representatives
default:
default learning shop stewards, basically. Over the last 18 months, those representatives have negotiated over 200 learning agreements with employers. That stuff is growing and getting more exciting and energetic with time. Very often, evaluations by BIS and others have found that union learning representatives are able to reach young workers without qualifications who have been failed by the education system, fellow workers who can talk to them man to man or woman to woman about the advantages of an education and how they do not need to be scared of it, how it can help you to get better pay. We are more likely to be believed by that target group than any other interlocutor. As it happens, you have asked me a question about the aspect of our work that we are 
defaultprobably 
defaultproudest of at the moment.
defaultThe Chairman:default That is a nice opportunity.
defaultQ78 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default Good afternoon. I am wondering about the extent to which the structures
default 
defaultwithin the unions
default—and I am speaking here particularly to the union representatives—are built in a way that the views of young people can be articulated
default,
default in the sense that you are getting to the depth of the young person’s view rather than perhaps picking up on the representative. Do you, for example, engage to a degree in doing survey work among young members as distinct from your standard membership survey work? I would be interested to hear whether we do that in the 
defaultUK
default or whether you think it is being done effectively elsewhere in 
defaultEurope
default and, if so, to whom we might turn our attention if we wanted a bit more information on that.
defaultMy s
defaultecond
default question
default, and I know this is a difficult area, 
defaultis about 
defaultthe reviews. The work 
defaultthat 
defaultwe are doing is primarily about unemployment, not about people who are in employment with all the difficulties they may 
defaultbe 
defaultencountering. Here we have close on a million NEETs. We are looking for ways in which we could try to see how they are communicated with either by representative organisations like yours or employers and the union side, 
defaultand 
defaultwhether the Government 
defaultare 
defaultdoing enough to be in touch with those people
default,
default or whether you have any ideas for us to consider 
defaultabout how 
defaulta gap needs to be filled in getting to the views of those people, not just to hear about the problems but how they can be helped better than they are at the moment.
defaultJohn Wastnagedefault: I think we can improve the tra
defaultcking, particularly of 16 to 19 
defaultyear-olds, of what happens when they leave education. The data 
defaultare 
defaultnot very good at the moment
default,
default so the truth is 
defaultthat 
defaultwe do not know what happens to a lot of people
default and 
defaultwhat their de
defaultstination is. The Government have
default also introduced this idea of destination measures for schools, 12 months after they leave I think. We would like to see that extended a bit further. At the moment, it is a good incentive for schools to make sure that their students go on to do something but not necessarily the right thing. We think 
defaultthat 
defaulta longer term measure would be a stronger incentive to make sure that it was the right destination.
defaultJust to pick up on what was said earlier, all membership organisations face a challenge at the moment. Younger generations are less likely to become members of membership organisations than older generations, not just because they are younger at the moment
default. It
default is a generational shift
default,
default and that trend will continue as they get older. It is upon all of us to adapt and make ourselves relevant to them. I was speaking to someone from the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry just last week
default,
default 
defaultwhich is 
defaultlaunching something called Digital Chamber, which is designed to try to appeal to businesses that are focused on digital industries. That is one example of how we are trying to evolve to change with the times.
defaultThe Chairman:default Do you have any ideas? I bet you have.
defaultNarmadadefault Thiranagamadefault: 
defaultW
defaulte have a young members’ network, so we give them the ability to meet and talk to each other. We try not 
defaultto 
defaulthave the same kinds of bureaucracy for them that we 
defaulthave 
defaultin other parts of our trade union movement. We try to make it as informal as possible, giv
defaulting
default them the ability to talk to other young people
default and 
defaultto come up with ideas about how to talk to other young people about what is of concern to them. We represent about 68,000 young people at the moment. One of the surprising things is that we have a general recruitment campaign. It is not targeted at young people; it is targeted at our wider membership. It is based around issues 
defaultsuch as 
defaultinsecure employment
default and 
defaultworries about coping in the current economic climate, but it is recruiting young people. That is one of the things I was surprised by. It is as relevant to young members as it is to any of our other members. We are recruiting more young members now than we did a couple of years ago. 
defaultThat is one of the things where new experiences can change our relevance to young people
default,
default and we are always trying to find ways of communicating to all different parts of our members, not just young people. There are other members, our low-paid members, who do not have access to the internet or to computers or who may work in different locations. These are all challenges 
defaultthat 
defaultwe are always trying to think about. We do targeted surveys of our members. With young members, using computers and internet surveys is much easier than 
defaultit is 
defaultfor other members who do not have access to computers or who are low paid. We are always trying to learn from other people and learn from our members about how to better do this work.
defaultRichard Exelldefault: I was just going to take up one of Lord Brooke’s points.
default 
defaultI will j
defaultust say that of course both employers, because their primary relationship is with workers, and unions, because they are organisations of workers, face difficulties in relating to people who are not in work. We are aware of that and we try to deal with it through things like working with the National Union of Students so that we are working with their representatives before they are in work. We have schemes to open up union membership to people who are not in the workplace yet. Unions often offer preferential terms to unemployed or non-employed people to join or stay in the union. This is one of the main reasons why we set up our network of unemployed workers’ centres to get over this point.
defaultI should say that one of the things that other countries in 
defaultEurope
default, particularly in the Germanic tradition, do very well is 
defaultuse g
defaultovernment funds through the social partners to achieve social objectives. 
defaultIn
default 
defaultAustria
default, 
defaultfor instance, 
defaultboth the employers and the unions have networks of careers guidance centres run by employers and unions. Of course, 
defaultthat relies 
defaulton 
defaultg
defaultovernment funding. Obviously, we would like 
defaultto see that, but unfortunately we have never quite succeeded in persuading any Government to give us that money.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultL
defaultet us not forget that the European Union has allocated €8 billion to this.
defaultRichard Exelldefault: If you could persuade the Government t
defaulto give us some of it, we would be delighted.
defaultQ79 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default We 
defaultwould
defaulthave to make a jolly good case. Do not forget
default that 
defaultin a lot of it you are competing with people putting their cases in. It just seems to me that we rely on the young people for our pensions if nothing else, but the young people today are inquiring and are quite confident by comparison 
defaultwith 
defaultwhen I was a youngster. All they need is for people to be interested in them. The sort of things you are talking about
default—
defaultthis Germanic model and the way you combine the unions and employers
default—
defaultif you know about 
defaultthem,
default why are you not doing 
defaultthem
default?
defaultRichard Exelldefault: We have been arguing for that for quite some time. I am trying not to be overly partisan about this, but we have been more enthusiastic on that agenda than the other people who would need to be involved.
defaultThe Chairman:default Okay. All I can say is
default that
default I will leave you with this: it is something that needs to be done.
defaultJohn Wastnagedefault: I would be very happy to sit down.
defaultThe Chairman:default If all of us feel really supportive of the fact that we must get our young people to be positive about the future and to think that work is enjoyable and necessary and build
defaults
default growth and so on, it just needs everybody who has been through it to put their minds to it and say, “What can we do?”
default.
default Anyway, thank you.
defaultNow, particularly to the British Chambers of Commerce representative, do you think 
defaultthat 
defaultemployers should be expected to do more to meet the skills and employability gaps
default, such as 
defaultthe breakfast club 
defaultfor children 
defaultor something like that
default?
default I am not suggesting 
defaultthis
default, but some churches, in the area where I live
default,
default target some young people who are pretty well no-hopers and encourage them to be more confident and develop and teach them social skills in dealing with customers
default,
default and 
defaultothers
default. Are you doing that?
defaultJohn Wastnagedefault: It is quite a varied picture among employers
default,
default but lots of employers work with their local schools or local community groups. It tends to be that the management has a particular interest in that rather than it being a general business culture in this country. Chambers of commerce do work with schools. I was just talking to St Helens Chamber yesterday. 
defaultIt
default work
defaults
default with about 30 primary schools in 
defaultits 
defaultarea 
defaultto run 
defaultenterprise schemes. 
defaultIt 
defaultalso work
defaults
default with NEETs who have left the education system.
defaultThe Chairman:default Who 
defaultare still looking for work, yes?
defaultJohn Wastnagedefault: 
defaultIts case study was one of those
default used in the Government’s traineeship discussion paper. 
defaultIt 
defaultalready ran a scheme for those NEETs 
defaultthat 
defaultfocused on employability skills and then co-ordinat
defaulted
default work experience. One of the problems for employers and educational institutions is that there are no bodies funded to co-ordinate between the two of them. Chambers of commerce, as with trade unions, would love to do lots of additional work in their communities but 
defaultthey 
defaultsimply cannot afford to do it.
defaultThe Chairman:default You are aware of the employability gaps and the skills required. Do you ever make statements about that to encourage other people to think, “Gosh, perhaps we ought to get more funding for it
default.
default”?
defaultJohn Wastnagedefault: Like all the business groups, we have made a lot of statements 
defaultin the past 
defaultabout employability skills
default,
default soft skills
default,
default functional skills, literacy
default,
default numeracy and so on. Going back to what you said earlier, we are keen to focus more on rolling up our shirt sleeves at a local level. I would be very happy to sit down with Richard and his colleagues at Unionlearn—I already have good conversations with Unionlearn—about how we can work locally while continuing to lobby about policy changes at a national level
default,
default but focus on the relationships at a local level
default,
default and 
defaulton 
defaulthow we can deliver more sustainable change in local communities.
defaultThe Chairman:default By the answers to the questions to you, Ms—
defaultNarmadadefault Thiranagamadefault: Thiranagama. It is a long name.
defaultThe Chairman:default —I understand that you would feel intrinsically supportive of that, but you are probably doing it already, are you?
defaultNarmadadefault Thiranagamadefault: I would say in addition to what has been said that in the other models we are talking about where this is embedded into the system, hundreds of years of history have gone into creating those models. While we can admire it and try to do it, at the moment without the history of it we would just be taking bits of it and bringing it over.
defaultThe Chairman:default Yes. You need the whole thing to come together.
defaultNarmadadefault Thiranagamadefault: We need to work to create the supportive culture of allowing that to happen in a more systematic way rather than the efforts we are making as unions
default and 
defaultas employers, which 
defaultare 
defaultnot co-ordinated or brought together in a way that would make a much more dramatic impact.
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you very much. Lord Haskel, it is your question.
defaultQ80 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Haskel:default I wonder 
defaultwhether 
defaultwe could come back to the European aspect
default,
default because we are a European 
defaultC
defaultommittee. The European Trade Union Confederation talks a lot about the importance of the social dialogue—we were just discussing that before—between unions and employers as a means to agree and deliver effective response to problems like youth unemployment. Do you agree with this? Is it working here?
defaultThe Chairman:default I have three important questions
default. T
defaulthis is the first one. Can we be brief, please? You could always write to us.
defaultRichard Exelldefault: Okay. Social partnership is much more developed on the continent than it is in this country. The assumption that 
defaultg
defaultovernment looks to employers and unions as partners for achieving social objectives is startling in the 
defaultUK
default context. No, we are not as well developed here as they are on the continent.
defaultOn the continent, we work with BUSINESSEUROPE and the other employer organisations. For instance, I helped negotiate a joint statement on inclusive labour markets, making the case for labour markets adapted to recruit disadvantaged groups, including young people. 
defaultThe 
defaultCBI, the Local Government Association and the TUC have just published a UK-level version of that document 
defaultthat is 
defaultmade up of good practice case studies to show that that is possible in this country. I will send the clerk the web address for that.
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you very much indeed.
defaultJohn Wastnagedefault: I would echo Richard’s comments. It is clearly less developed in the 
defaultUK
default than in other European countries.
defaultThe Chairman:default All right, thank you. Do you have any information that is in addition to your two colleagues?
defaultNarmada Thiranagamadefault: Just to say 
defaultquickly 
defaultthat it 
defaultbasically 
defaultenables 
defaultnegotiation for there to be more general skills 
defaultin 
defaultEurope
default and 
defaultbetter quality apprenticeships and vocational qualifications. It allows people to look at the longer term future of the young people involved. That is why it is important.
defaultQ81 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultEarl of defaultLiverpooldefault:default Good afternoon. I wonder 
defaultwhether 
defaultyou could tell us your views on the measures currently being taken in the 
defaultUK
default to combat youth unemployment
default, 
defaultfor example the youth contract and more promotion of apprenticeships and work experience. We have talked about that earlier. What more or different things, though, do you think should or could be done?
defaultRichard Exelldefault: Perhaps I could kick off on that one
default,
default and I will try to be brief, Chair. 
defaultThe y
defaultouth contract is sometimes described as the current Government’s answer to the 
defaultFuture Jobs Fund
default. It is much more like an answer to the new deal for young people. It has the same mix of work experience, subsidised job and a strong-arm element for people who refuse to engage with the other parts of it. If you look at the performance so far, first of all, the main characteristic of it, if you compared it with the new deal, is that it is substantially cheaper. Even in cash terms, the subsidy is lower than the new deal for young people offered. If you take inflation 
defaultinto account, 
defaultit is much less generous. There is nothing wrong with it. We support job subsidy programmes. We always thought the Government 
defaultwere 
defaultinsanely ambitious in saying they would get 160,000 subsidised job places in three years. So far it has been something like 4,000 after a year and a half
default,
default and that is more in line with what we expected, but we do think it will perk up in its final year and a half.
defaultWhat would 
defaultwe 
defaultlike? We liked the 
defaultFuture Jobs Fund
default. The 
defaultFuture Jobs Fund 
defaultwas the sort of programme we 
defaulthave
default been calling for for the last 30 years. The difference between the 
defaultFuture Jobs Fund
default and failed work experience programmes is that the 
defaultFuture Jobs Fund 
defaultoffered real jobs paid at least the minimum wage. We do not have any problem with requiring people to engage in work experience so long as they are paid decently for the work that they do. The evaluation of the 
defaultFuture Jobs Fund 
defaultwas extremely positive. You have a policy analyst, a clerk and an adviser here. They probably have access to all the data on that so they will know the studies I am referring to.
defaultJohn Wastnagedefault: Likewise, we were supportive of the youth contract. We thought it was possibly a bit ambitious given the economic conditions, although the projections were not as bad as they have turned out 
defaultto be
default. One of the main failings of the Government is that they have not promoted it enough. We send regular messages
default 
defaultabout the youth contract
default, not so much now but we have done 
defaultso 
defaultover the last 18 months, and still when we ask our members the message just is not getting through to them. Even if they have heard of the youth contract
default,
default they do not know what it involves. Even if they know what it involves, when they start going down the route of trying to access it, certainly in the initial six months, they find it incredibly difficult to do so. We as an organisation tried to hire someone using the youth contract and highlighted to the Secretary of State the fact that we could only get through to voicemail 
defaultwhen 
defaultphoning the phone numbers that were advertised.
defaultThe Chairman:default Oh, dear. I do not think we will put that in our report
default,
default but we might mention it in the corridors.
defaultJohn Wastnagedefault: He addressed it. They introduced a secret shopper approach where they checked out all the providers. I understand why the Government ha
defaultve
default frozen 
defaulttheir 
defaultmarketing budgets generally, but certain programmes merit greater promotion. I think that was one of them. 
defaultWe think that 
defaultwork experience in general is of value to individuals. Whether it needs to be paid or not is something to be debated. It depends on the length of the duration.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultOn the c
defaultircumstances, yes. Ms
default—I am determined to get it right this time
default—Thiranagama
default.
defaultNarmadadefault Thiranagamadefault: That is very good. I would just quickly add that in evidence to a House of Commons 
defaultS
defaultelect 
defaultC
defaultommittee, 
defaultFuture Jobs Fund 
defaultproviders highlighted one of the benefits of the 
defaultFuture Jobs Fund
default, in addition to the other positive evaluations, 
defaultwhich 
defaultis that it made them feel like they were doing a real job. They felt they were independent and a full member of society. Simply having th
defaulte
default kind of work that was not seen as punitive 
defaultor 
defaulta scheme, they felt like they were properly doing a job. That gave those young people a real sense of self-esteem about themselves in the world of work.
defaultThe Chairman:default That is very important.
defaultNarmadadefault Thiranagamadefault: Yes, I think it is.
defaultQ82 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default Can I take Lord Liverpool’s question and put it into a European context as a whole
default,
default and do it in two parts? 
defaultPart o
defaultne is: what do you think of the various European schemes? You will know them all well
default:
default the youth guarantee, 
defaultthe 
defaultoffer of a job within a set period of time, and extra money to areas of particularly high unemployment. What do you think
default of those pan-European measures
default?
defaultPart two,
default flipping over what Mr Wastnage said about there 
defaultbeing
default things that we do that other European countries can learn from, what is being done in other European countries that we can learn from? So, 
defaultan answer 
defaultin two parts, please.
defaultRichard Exelldefault: First of all
default,
default on the youth guarantee, obviously we suppo
defaultrt it. It bears remarkable family resemblance to the 
defaultFuture Jobs Fund
default. We have two problems 
defaultwith 
defaultit
default. O
defaultne is that the €194 billion allocated for it was not as much as we were hoping for. I am really trying hard not to be partisan over this, but the 
defaultUK
default is the only country out of 28 that has said it will not have a youth guarantee implementation plan. Every other country eligible for youth employment initiative funding is either in the process of submitting its implementation plan or has already done so. The o
defaultnly explanation I have seen for that is the fact that it was not invented here. That is a very depressing reason for not going ahead with this.
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default Sorry, did I catch you right? You said it was very like our scheme?
defaultRichard Exelldefault: Yes, it was very like the 
defaultFuture Jobs Fund
default.
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default So
default it was 
defaultpart invented.
defaultRichard Exelldefault: Undoubtedly, the Commission learn
defaultt
default important lessons from that. I should say 
defaultthat 
defaultI know you are trying to get European TUC to come here and give evidence as well. The ETUC was very disappointed that the youth guarantee is only a recommendation rather than a requirement for getting funding. We lobb
defaultied
default very hard to have something stronger than a recommendation on this, but unfortunately back in July Mark Hoban boasted to a Commons 
defaultS
defaultelect 
defaultC
defaultommittee that he had succeeded in writing the youth guarantee out of the requirements for funding.
defaultQ83 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultWell, that is one Member. Mr Wastnage, d
defaulto you have anything to add on that one?
defaultJohn Wastnagedefault: Yes. We are supportive of the idea of certainly guaranteeing access to training or work experience. We have not polled our members about the youth guarantee, the actual guaranteeing a job aspect, if that were introduced. My concern is that it would have to go hand in hand with a stronger approach on the supply side to improving skills. We think that is a better approach
default:
default trying to address in the medium to long term employability skills, contact with employers, work experience and so on, so that young people are able to compete better for the jobs that are available rather than having jobs assigned to them.
defaultI would just like also to highlight the Erasmus+ scheme, which is coming. It is the replacement for Erasmus, as you probably know. In the 
defaultUK
default, we have quite a low take-up, probably because of our lack of language skills. In some senses, we have to start thinking about operating in a European labour market rather than a national labour market. We have flows of European workers coming here. Mobility is helpful to the European labour market in general and we are doing a disservice to our young people if they are not able to access jobs in other countries when jobs are not available here. It gives them more opportunities and perhaps even more exciting opportunities.
defaultThe Chairman:default Skills opportunity
default to increase their skills and experience, of course.
defaultJohn Wastnagedefault: We also know from surveying our own members that businesses where senior managers have had experience of living in other countries are much more likely to export and to export to those markets.
defaultThe Chairman:default Yes, because they are comfortable.
defaultJohn Wastnagedefault: It makes common sense
default,
default but it 
defaultis borne 
defaultout in the statistics as well.
defaultNarmadadefault Thiranagamadefault: I do not have much to add to what has been said already. I just want to highlight one thing that I do not think we have covered, which is the huge impact that where you are living has on 
defaultyour
default job opportunities, especially for young people who might have transport difficulties. There are areas of this country that have not really recovered from previous recessions. Each one has left its mark. It has left some deep-seated problems that 
defaultare 
defaultvery much being experienced by people, particularly young people.
defaultI would also add that a lot of information about skills, or job opportunities even, is through informal networks and informal hiring practices. That is another thing that disadvantages young people
default,
default especially because they have had even 
defaultfewer
default opportunities to acquire those
default,
default or if they have them it is through their families.
defaultThe Chairman:default Pushy parents, as I call them, yes.
defaultJohn Wastnagedefault: That is why careers education is so important because it rebalances.
defaultThe Chairman:default Yes, 
defaultthat is 
defaultabsolutely right.
defaultRichard Exelldefault: Could I just take the opportunity to put in face
default 
defaultto
default 
defaultface careers guidance? We are particularly
default worried about the loss of face 
defaultto
default 
defaultface careers guidance at the moment.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultT
defaulthank you. That has been great. Any more questions from any Members? No. 
defaultI
defaultt has been a wonderful session
default,
default so thank you very much. 
defaultC
defaultould you please write to us with the statistics and the reports that you have cited
default,
default because we have not necessarily taken them all down? 
defaultI
defaultf you have examples of employers and unions working together on skills and youth employment, that would 
defaultalso 
defaultbe very useful. It would round it all off. Again, on behalf of the Committee, thank you very much indeed.
default&#xa0;
default
