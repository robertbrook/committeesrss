default&#xa0;
default12)
default              
defaultSome technical debate and much possible untrained 
defaultpolicy-maker confusion may though arise from the IPCC's conclusions as they move into forecast scenarios
default…
default&#xa0;
defaultGlobal surface temperature change for the end of the 21st century is
default 
defaultlikely
default 
defaultto exceed 1.5°C relative to 1850 to 1900 for all RCP scenarios except RCP
default2.6. It is 
defaultlikely
default 
defaultto exceed 2°C for RCP6.0 and RCP8.5, and 
defaultmore likely than not 
defaultto exceed 2°C for RCP4.5. Warming will continue beyond 2100 under all RCP scenarios except RCP2.6. Warming will continue to exhibit 
defaultinterannual
default-to-decadal variability and will 
defaultnot be regionally uniform
default&#xa0;
default13)
default              
defaultFirst, there is no reason why our global society might strictly adhere to any particular IPCC Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP).  These have been created for illustrative purposes
default and as such the 
defaultforecasts are
default not de
defaultfinitive but
default 
defaultare
default useful
defaultly illustrative
default and important: 
defaultthe 
default2°C warming above pre-industrial
default the IPCC refer to above
default is the limit that some have considered as safe (though some argue that the safe limit is lower than this)
default.  
defaultI
defaultt does seem that we are on a 
defaulttrack similar to 'business-as-usual' (to use IPCC 1990 parlance).  Second, much depends on 'climate sensitivity' to greenhouse gas additions.  However in this regard the IPCC have increased their margin since AR4.
default AR5 says "
defaultEquilibrium climate sensitivity 
defaultis 
defaultlikely 
defaultin the range 1.5°C to 4.5°C (
defaulthigh confidence
default)"
default. This is broader than 2 - 4.5°C in AR4 and it might be that the IPCC is hedging its bets due to the current pause in warming.
default&#xa0;
default14)
default              
default"
defaultChanges in the global water cycle in response to the warming over t
defaulthe 21st century will not be uniform. The contrast in precipitation between wet and dry regions and between wet and dry seasons will increase, although there may be regional exceptions
default"
default&#xa0;
default15)
default              
defaultThis conclusion firms up what has 
defaultpreviously 
defaultbeen expected.
default  As ha
defaults…
default&#xa0;
default"
defaultThe global ocean will continue to warm during the 21st century. Heat will penetrate from the surface to the deep ocean and affect ocean circulation.

defaultThis is being observed in places though we have a far from complete monitoring of deep and abyss
defaultal waters.
default&#xa0;
default17)
default              
default"
defaultIt is 
defaultvery likely
default 
defaultthat the Arctic sea ice cover will continue to shrink and thin and that Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover will decrease during the 21st century as global mean surface temperature rises. Global glacier volume will 
defaultfurther decrease.

default              
defaultT
defaulthis is now clear and nations are positioning themselves for development of the Arctic.
default&#xa0;
default19)
default 
default              
default"
defaultGlobal mean sea level will continue to rise during the 21st century. Under all RCP scenarios the rate of sea level rise will 
defaultvery likely 
defaultexceed that observed during 1971–2010 due to increased ocean warming and increased loss of mass from glaciers and ice sheets.
default"
default&#xa0;
default20)
default              
defaultThis also is clear.  However what we cannot say with much certainty is
default broadly
default how much sea level will rise by the end of th
defaulte century
default though it will certainly rise
default.
default Sea level rise is far more a source of debate among the climate change science community.

defaultClimate change will affect carbon cycle processes in a way that will exacerbate the increase of CO

defaultin the atmosphere (

default"
default&#xa0;
default22)
default              
defaultThe IPCC say this with 'high confidence' and I concur
default (I come to
default the climate science table through the life and environmental sciences)
default.  What is uncertain is 
defaultthe degree of this positive feedback effect which could be more serious than the three lines of this conclusion suggest.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultSelect Committee question:default 
defaultTo what extent does AR5 reflect the range of views among climate scientists?
default&#xa0;
default23
default) 
default              
defaultViews vary largely due 
defaultto detail and nuance and not the overall IPCC thrust
default              
defaultIf you want a proper answer to this 
defaultquestion 
defaultthen a survey needs to be commissioned.  
defaultI do meet climate change science researchers in committees and at symposia.  
defaultMy own 
default(personal and unscientific) 
defaulttake
default with the ecological, Earth system scientists and others involved in c
defaultlimate change research (who
default may not consider themselves to be '
defaultclimatologists
default' 
default('climate scientists') 
defaultas 
defaultper
default the subject of the Committee's question) is that there is little that is very
default new in the AR5 report and nothing that necessitates a marked change to current research programmes.  There is therefore little merit to question the 
defaultAR5 
defaultconclusions 
defaultand the climate community views 
defaultbeyond those previously asked of the AR4 assessment
default.
default  
defaultHowe
defaultver,
default my impression is that the IPCC Assessments are consensus views 
defaultassembled from experts whose own views 
defaultvary from individual 
defaultto individual
default only in nuance and detail, and not 
defaultwith regard to
default the 
defaultbroad, 
defaultoverall IPCC conclusions.
default (I have not discerned a sma
defaultll minority whose views markedly differ from the IPCC's overall conclusions but given that I have not 
defaultpersonally 
defaultmet many IPCC principal authors it could be I missed them.
default Having said that, I do read the primary literature widely
default and meet a number of scien
defaulttists whose work feeds in to the IPCC process
default.
default)
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultSelect Committee question:default 
defaultHow robust are the conclusions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis report? Have the IPCC adequately addressed criticisms of previous reports? How much scope is there to question of
default the report’s conclusions?
default&#xa0;
default24
default)
default              
defaultMost AR4 criticisms relate to WG II and III
default              
defaultI have an
defaultswered most of this above.  
defaultHowever,
default with regards to 
defaultaddressing criticisms of AR4 it should be noted that most of AR4's criticisms (such as the Himalaya glacier 
defaultstatement) do not relate to the IPCC WG I which focuses on the science, but W
defaultGs II and III.  (Remember, WG I-related 
defaultconcerns over things like the Mann hockey-stic
defaultk graph were raised prior to AR5
default and were
default mainly
default addressed in the AR4 2007 assessment
default's WG I
default.
default)  
default&#xa0;
default25)
default              
defaultSea level rise has long been more debatable
default              
defaultSea level rise has long been more debatable compared to temperature rise and the IPCC is rightly less specific here (indeed some might say overly cautious)
default but a reading of the academic literature does not (yet) provide a clear picture
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultSelect Committee question:default 
defaultHow effective is AR5 and the summary for policymakers in conveying what is meant by 
defaultuncertainty in scientific terms
default? Would a focus on risk rathe
defaultr than uncertainty be useful?
default&#xa0;
default26)
default              
defaultR
defaultisk is more the province of WG II and III
default              
defaultUncertainty
default has always been difficult to convey outside of science and statisticians.  The IPCC has come up with a system that conveys uncertainty as well as might
default for policy-ma
defaultkers
default. A focus on 'risk' would be decidedly out of place in WG
default 
defaultI.  
default'
defaultRisk
default'
default implies that there is something being risked and hence that there are 
default'
defaultstakes
default'
default and 'hazard'
default.  This takes us into the realm of degree of 
default'
defaultimpacts
default'
default and 
default'
defaultlikelihood thereof
default'
default,
default and this is firmly the province of WG II.
default  There is a difference between 'certainty' (or 'probability'), 'risk' and hazard'.  (I am likely to be able to walk ten feet along a joined twin line of bricks laid on the ground without much problem.  However if 
defaultthis two line of bricks was part of a tall
default, two-brick wide,
default wall then though (psychology aside) I may still be able to walk it with the same 
default'
defaultcertainty
default'
default, the 
default'
defaulthazard
default'
default if I came off would be much greater.)
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultSelect Committee question: 
defaultCan any of the areas o
defaultf the science now be considered settled as a result of AR5’s publication, if so which? 
default&#xa0;
default27)
default              
defaultAreas settled
default              
defaultThe IPCC's assessments as a whole (1990-2013) portray a clear picture that:
default-
defaulti
default)    The Earth is currently warming
defaultii)   The Earth's climate has chan
defaultged in the past
defaultiii)  Climate change has a major impact on natural systems (on which we depend) 
defaultiv) Current warming is largely due to human activity and the trajectory is unprecedented in human history leading to more
default intense extreme weather events
default&#xa0;
defaultPolic
defaulty-makers should consider t
defaulthese matters 
defaultsettled
default.
default  It is therefore worrying that a still few members of either side of both Houses
default in 
defaultWestminster
default do not accept 
defaultthe policy-maker (UN) created scientific consensus (IPCC) view.  If these policy-makers will not 
defaultaccept this view, on what authority are they basing their decisions?
default&#xa0;
default28)
default              
defaultGood to see long-term business-as-usual forecasts beginning to be considered
default              
defaultThere are a number of new areas of science in the main body of the IPCC text yet to be approved.  I was 
defaultpleased to see
default (in the draft of chapter 12)
default consideration of RCP 
default8.5 which is 
defaulteffectively continued 
defaultlong-term 
defaultreliance on fossil fuel
defaults (
defaultincluding more expensive fossil fuels such as tar sand
defaults) beyond the 21st century, as this is the trajectory we are curre
defaultntly on (we have yet to begin to stabilise greenhouse emissions and these are still increasing) and policy-makers do need to know where we
default are heading
default if we fail to 
defaultact 
defaultdecisively. This long-term projection depicts a median temperature rise of around 8°C b
defaulty 2150 (and I am not sure if this includes permafrost and methane 
defaultclathrate
default positive feedback
defaults
default, if not then this warming will be more 
defaultsevere, and if it does
default 
defaultinclude
default feedbacks
default this
default 8°C
default is more than severe enough to completely disrupt
default the
default current 
defaultpattern of 
defaultagricultural systems globally).  The IPCC has to date been reluctant to look at such a long-term, business-as-usual type scenario.  This I suspect has been because it has not wanted to be overly alarmist and back in 1990 (its first assessment) it 
defaultpossibly 
defaultdid not consider that a quarter of a century on we would still be on its (1990) business-as-usual trajectory.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultSelect Committee question:default 
defaultWhat areas need further effort to reduce the levels of uncertainty?
default&#xa0;
default29)
default              
defaultW
defaulteather and climate hence computers and 
defaultEarth system modelling need continued effort
default              
defaultThe exact degree of warming and the nature of weather and weather patterns in a warmer world needs further elucidation.  This requires better modelling, both 
defaultvia
default understanding of the Earth system and model exec
defaultution which require
defaults
default improved computer technology.  The models themselves require increased resolution and improved biological components (including bio-geological components such as soil an
defaultd marine carbon biosphere res
defaultervoirs
default).
default 
default 
defaultCurrently the race to impr
defaultove computer technology and climate models is more or less neck and neck and is likely to continue with
default research
default investment as is.
default  This is a long-term venture and polic
defaulty-makers need to realise that w
defaultith this research we are likely in for the long-haul wit
defaulth incremental progress continually being made
default over the years
default.
default&#xa0;
default30)
default              
defaultSolar monitoring
default              
defaultOf lesser concern, solar monitoring is also required and here much is already
default being done or research
default 
defaultis 
defaultin train.  However here it will be a while before we have a suffici
defaultently long record before 
defaultmajor 
defaultsolar uncertainties 
defaultcan be reasonably 
defaultassessed
default.
default  Having said that (and I should say that here I am looking outside my own area of interest and over the shoulders of others), it is unlikely that solar influence will hugely aff
defaultect the broad warming trajectory in the long-term 
defaultwe currently foresee, 
defaultbut it might affect decadal warming
default adding a ripple to the longer-term warming trend
default.
default&#xa0;
default31)
default              
defaultEarth system science and crossing critical transitions needs more attention
default              
defaultWhat is importan
defaultt is Earth system (biosphere science) research. 
defaultEarth system understanding in turn requires continued long-term monitoring and, importantly, improved 
defaultthermal 
defaultmonitoring of deep seas and abyssal depths.  It also requires better 
defaultund
defaulterstanding of 
defaultpalaeoclimat
defaultes
default.  Here t
defaulthe probability of flipping to a new climate state also needs to be considered
default should the Earth
default system
default go through a 'critical transition'
default and cross a climate threshold
default.  
defaultWith this in mind, 
defaultAR4 
default(WG I, 2007, pp442-3, in chapter 8, 
defaultPalaeoclimate
default, section 6.3.3) 
defaultdrew attention to the similarities of what we are doing now with what are known as carbon isotope excursion events especially that of the early Eocene 55 million years ago
default (known as the IETM
default or PETM)
default.
default 
defaultBack then
default it seems as if 
defaultvulcanic
default greenhouse gas warmed the Earth so inducing the release of organic carbon 
default(12-carbon rich) 
defaultfrom biosphere reservoirs which enhanced the warming further 
defaultvia
default a positive feedback loop.
default This warming event was 
defaultinitia
defaultted within a few centuries, and saw temperature
default rise
default, sea level rise, ocean acidification and marked biome (ecosystem assemblages) shift
default 
defaultpol
defaulte
defaultwards
default, for around 100,000 years.  Furthermore, we know from carbon isotope (13C/12C) analysis 
defaultbroadly
default the amount of
default 12-carbon isotope rich greenhouse gas involved
default,
default and as AR4 noted this was 
defaultof a
default similar 
defaultorder of magnitude 
defaultto the amount of carbon we will have likely emitted since the industrial revolution and the end of this century unless radical actions are taken to c
defaulturb greenhouse gas emissions.
default  It is therefore a shame that the ambition laid out in 
defaultAgreed Reference Material For The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report
default (2009) that AR5 would see ' [
defaultPalaeoclimate
default] Abrupt climate changes and their regional expression'
default,
default as well a
defaults '
defaultPalaeoclimate
default perspective on irreversibility in the climate system'
default,
default was not realised.  Had it been realised AR5 would have most likely seen a further assessment of the PETM / IETM literature as well as that on critical transitions
default and climate threshold
defaults
default.
default&#xa0;
default32)
default              
defaultThere is a possible policy gap between DECC and DEFRA policy-driven research, an example being managing species shift for both biological conservation and carbon management purposes
default              
defaultA little beyond the scope of this consultation, but nonetheless r
defaultelated, is the question of ecological shift.  Given global warming will be inevitable in the absence of major cuts in emissions
default as the WG I 
defaultSummary for Policymakers 
defaultmakes clear,
default, species' range
defaults
default will shift.  Yet with some ecosystems (such as woodland) taking many decades to establish, there is a very strong case for species transloca
defaulttion along climate gradients.  Yet c
defaulturrently there are no formally agreed protocols for such translocation.  Nor ar
defaulte their formal networks of dialogue between nature reserves along climate gradients nationally and internationally 
defaultto
default manage species and ecosystem migration
default,
default as well as
default maintaining
default carbon-related ecosystem function
default in addition to biological conservation
default.  
defaultI mention this now as there is concern that some research and policy discussion may fall between DECC and DEFRA stools.  As climate-chang
defaulte
default-driven species translocation is climate change, and carbon, related it could be argued as to fall under DECC's purvie
defaultw. 
defaultConversely,
default as 
defaultthese are
default to do with environmental conservation it could be seen as the responsibility of DEFRA.  
defaultConsequently,
default I flag this issue now for your attention.
default&#xa0;
default33)
default              
defaultFuture IPCC forecast portrayals need to be standardised and compared with past 
defaultB-a-U forecasts
default              
defaultEach IPCC Assessment has a graph of warming projections over the 21st century.  Here the date the projections commence vary from assessment to assessment and there is no sense given as to how these compare with previous Assessment projecti
defaultons. 
defaultWhat I would like to see
default 
defaultin the next IPCC Assessment WG I report (AR6) is for the warming projections to commence from 1990 as that is a key policy date. I would also like to see
default additionally
default a graph of all the IPCC business-as-usual scenarios and the
defaultir SRES and RCP analogues from the various Assessments 
default(1990-2013 
defaultetc
default) 
defaultall on the same graph.  I have actually done this for the assessments up to and including AR4 (2007) and they all fall within the upper and lower estimates for the IPCC 1990 business-as
default-usual scenario: they are (un)surprisingly similar and should lend confidence as to the continuation of message.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default              defaultSelect Committee question:default 
defaultHas AR5 sufficiently explained the reasons behind the widely reported hiatus in the global surface temperature 
defaultrecord?
default&#xa0;
default34)
default              
defaultPause not yet satisfactorily explained
default              
defaultI have not (yet) come across a detailed examination of this question in AR5 (but this may be because I have not read the whole 
defaultdraft 
defaultWG I 
defaultvolume 
defaultthoroughly
default)
default.  
defaultSpeaking personally, i
defaultt should be said that we cannot say exactly why the global surface record has 
defaultceased to show an overall warming trend the past one-and-a-half decades since near the end of the 20th century.  Having said that
default,
default this 'pause' is not that particularly unexpecte
defaultd and th
defaultere a
defaultre a number of possible explanations
default for it
default.  It is 'not unexpected' because we have had pauses before. The period from 1940 – 1980 was a previous pause.  
defaultYet
default, because there is now more anthropogenic greenhouse gas in the atmosphere today comp
defaultared to back then, and 
defaultbecause
default atmospheric greenhouse concentrations are continuing to rise, we might expect this current pause to be shorter.
default&#xa0;
default35)
default              
defaultThe long pause was predicted
default              
defaultFurthermore, this pause is not only 
default'
defaultnot unusual
default'
default it was actually predicted by
default at least one team half a decade ago that the then short warming pause would continue (Yu 
defaultKosaka
default &amp; Shang-Ping 
defaultXie
default, 2008, 
defaultNature
default 
default501,default 403-7). They predicted that the N. Atlantic would cool as would the Pacific. 
default(Their reasons 
defaulthypothesised 
defaultwere 
defaultweather/clima
defaultte
default cycle and 
defaultBroecker
default global 
defaultthermohaline
default circulation related.)
default 
defaultThey said
default that such cooling may be so great as to impede the current warming trend.  They.. 
default"
defaultconclude that the recent cooling of the tropical Pacific and hence the current hiatus are probably 
defaultdue to natural internal variability rather than a forced response. If so, the hiatus is temporary, and global warming will return when the tropical Pacific swings back to a warm state. Similar hiatus events may occur in the future..
default."  
default&#xa0;
default36)
default              
defaultThe question 
defaultof importance is where has the heat gone?
default              
defaultMore recently other work points to the El Niño cycle (again the Pacific
default related
default)
default as the cause of the pause
default.  There are other 
defaultexplanations that
default may or may not have a significant bearing on the problem and these inc
defaultlude our lack of 
defaulta spatially 
defaultdetailed long-term Arctic record.  Irrespectively, the hiatus in the global surface temperature record does not undermine the IPCC consensus view.

default              
defaultAt thi
defaults point I would like to take leave of the IPCC and draw the Committee
default'
defaults attention to the implications of the world continuing its addiction to fossil carbon.  Irrespective of climate change concerns, fossil fuel consumption is increasing.  Yet we all know too well that fossil fuels are finite.  The cheap fossil fuel 
defaultreserves
default go
default first
default leaving more expensive reserves
default for later use
default.  This drives up prices.  World population is
default also
default growing and so demand for fossil fuel rises. This too drives up prices.  
defaultThese 
defaultdifferent

defaultThe long-t

defaultinevitably 
defaultset to increase.  It is therefore in nations' interests to switch to non-fossil fuel energy

default              
defaultThere is more than a little

default about this question.  Let us be clear, policy-makers (those concerned with political commitment) through the United Nations (UN) called for

default an assessment of climate change science, and

default called 
defaultupon
default two of its agencies (the UN Environment Programme and World Meteorological
default Organiz
defaultation
default) to establish the IPCC and this they did in 1988.  That the IPCC has provided a sufficiently clear picture
default,
default that demonstrates that political commitment is 
defaultwarranted
default,
default is neither a failing of the IPCC nor an indication that there is some sort of bias.  Climate change has been an issue on 
defaultthe formal agenda of the World's political leaders at least since 1972 and the UN Conference on the Human Environment that y

defaultUN
default member states.  The IPCC itself does not define what political action should be taken: it
default simply
default provides information.  That climate change is an issue of political concern precedes the IPCC and was the reason for it
