[normal]Summary[bold]              
[normal]There is little that is markedly new in AR5
[normal] WGI 
[normal]Summary for Policy Makers
[normal] (other than the IPCC is at last beginning to consider long
[normal]er
[normal]-term business-as-usual scenarios
[normal] in the main body of the text
[normal]).  AR5 largely affirms (and in this sense strengthens) AR4
[normal]'s conclusions
[normal]. 
[normal]AR5 is a staging post in charting the on-going progress of
[normal] climate change science.
[normal] There are areas of future concern that do deserve further attention
[normal] such as the possibility of crossing a climate threshold (critical transition)
[normal].  There is also a presentational issue of comparing forecasts across the sweep of IPC
[normal]C Assessments.
[normal]  Separately, t
[normal]here is a policy-driven research issue that might fall between DECC and DEFRA stools
[normal]: that of the need for species translocation protocols to manage carbon and biological conservation due to climate change driven biome shift
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]Caveat[bold]2)
[normal]              
[normal]Only a draft of AR5 WG
[normal] 
[normal]I has been released
[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]Other than the 
[normal]Summary for Policymakers
[normal], i
[normal]t should be noted that the
[normal] Inter Governmental Panel on Climate Change
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]IPCC
[normal])
[normal] have only released the draft of 
[normal]its Assessment Report 5 
[normal](AR5) W
[normal]orking Group I
[normal] (WG
[normal] 
[normal]I)
[normal] report, 
[normal]The 
[normal]Physical Science Basis
[normal],
[normal] in 'approved' form' and that this is on condition that it is 
[normal]not
[normal] quoted.  
[normal]Indeed, other than the
[normal] Summary for Policymakers
[normal],
[normal] the text released 
[normal]has not been finalised
[normal] not finalised
[normal],
[normal] and nor is it in the most readable format as the figures have yet to be embedded in the text (they currently appear separately at the end of 
[normal]each chapter's
[normal] text
[normal]s
[normal]).  Given this, and that the text of the WG
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal] is nigh on 1,000 pages
[normal],
[normal] I have not 
[normal]yet given it 
[normal]my full attention. 
[normal] I have though read the 
[normal]Summary for Policymakers
[normal] and the 
[normal]Technical Summary
[normal] 
[normal]as well as
[normal] skimmed a few of the chapters of personal interest.  (I would be genuinely surprised if anyone outside of the IPCC authorial team will have read all of
[normal] AR5's WGI report.)  (The WG II and WG III reports have yet to be released even in approved draft form.)  Given that the IPCC asks us not to quote their text
[normal] outside of the
[normal] Summary for Policymakers
[normal],
[normal] I will 
[normal]only quote from the 
[normal]Summary for Policymakers
[normal].  Hav
[normal]ing said that I may refer in general to some of the rest of the
[normal] WG I
[normal] report.

[normal]The conclusions are sound given

[normal]sound and 
[normal]based on verifiable observation

[normal] as broadly good guidance (such as the warming we will most likely experience given a certain, hypothetical future emissions path)

[normal]Warming of the climate system 
[normal]is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, and the concentrations of greenhouse gase

[normal]"
[normal]Human influence on the climate system is clear. This is evident from the increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, positive 
[normal]radiative
[normal] forcing, observed warming, and
[normal] understanding of the climate system.

[normal]"
[normal]Human influence has been detected in warming of the atmosphere and the ocean, in changes in 
[normal]the global water cycle, in reductions in snow and ice, in global mean sea level rise, and in changes in some climate extremes. This evidence for human influence has grown since AR4. It is 
[normal]extremely likely 
[normal]that human influence has been the dominant cause of
[normal] the observed warming since the mid-20th century.

[normal]the following
[normal]…
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]"
[normal]Continued emissions of 
[normal]greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system. Limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.
[normal]"
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12)
[normal]              
[normal]Some technical debate and much possible untrained 
[normal]policy-maker confusion may though arise from the IPCC's conclusions as they move into forecast scenarios
[normal]…
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Global surface temperature change for the end of the 21st century is
[normal] 
[normal]likely
[normal] 
[normal]to exceed 1.5°C relative to 1850 to 1900 for all RCP scenarios except RCP
[normal]2.6. It is 
[normal]likely
[normal] 
[normal]to exceed 2°C for RCP6.0 and RCP8.5, and 
[normal]more likely than not 
[normal]to exceed 2°C for RCP4.5. Warming will continue beyond 2100 under all RCP scenarios except RCP2.6. Warming will continue to exhibit 
[normal]interannual
[normal]-to-decadal variability and will 
[normal]not be regionally uniform
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13)
[normal]              
[normal]First, there is no reason why our global society might strictly adhere to any particular IPCC Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP).  These have been created for illustrative purposes
[normal] and as such the 
[normal]forecasts are
[normal] not de
[normal]finitive but
[normal] 
[normal]are
[normal] useful
[normal]ly illustrative
[normal] and important: 
[normal]the 
[normal]2°C warming above pre-industrial
[normal] the IPCC refer to above
[normal] is the limit that some have considered as safe (though some argue that the safe limit is lower than this)
[normal].  
[normal]I
[normal]t does seem that we are on a 
[normal]track similar to 'business-as-usual' (to use IPCC 1990 parlance).  Second, much depends on 'climate sensitivity' to greenhouse gas additions.  However in this regard the IPCC have increased their margin since AR4.
[normal] AR5 says "
[normal]Equilibrium climate sensitivity 
[normal]is 
[normal]likely 
[normal]in the range 1.5°C to 4.5°C (
[normal]high confidence
[normal])"
[normal]. This is broader than 2 - 4.5°C in AR4 and it might be that the IPCC is hedging its bets due to the current pause in warming.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14)
[normal]              
[normal]"
[normal]Changes in the global water cycle in response to the warming over t
[normal]he 21st century will not be uniform. The contrast in precipitation between wet and dry regions and between wet and dry seasons will increase, although there may be regional exceptions
[normal]"
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15)
[normal]              
[normal]This conclusion firms up what has 
[normal]previously 
[normal]been expected.
[normal]  As ha
[normal]s…
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]"
[normal]The global ocean will continue to warm during the 21st century. Heat will penetrate from the surface to the deep ocean and affect ocean circulation.
[normal]"
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16)
[normal]              
[normal]This is being observed in places though we have a far from complete monitoring of deep and abyss
[normal]al waters.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17)
[normal]              
[normal]"
[normal]It is 
[normal]very likely
[normal] 
[normal]that the Arctic sea ice cover will continue to shrink and thin and that Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover will decrease during the 21st century as global mean surface temperature rises. Global glacier volume will 
[normal]further decrease.
[normal]"
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18)
[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]his is now clear and nations are positioning themselves for development of the Arctic.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]19)
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]"
[normal]Global mean sea level will continue to rise during the 21st century. Under all RCP scenarios the rate of sea level rise will 
[normal]very likely 
[normal]exceed that observed during 1971–2010 due to increased ocean warming and increased loss of mass from glaciers and ice sheets.
[normal]"
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20)
[normal]              
[normal]This also is clear.  However what we cannot say with much certainty is
[normal] broadly
[normal] how much sea level will rise by the end of th
[normal]e century
[normal] though it will certainly rise
[normal].
[normal] Sea level rise is far more a source of debate among the climate change science community.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]21)
[normal]              
[normal]"
[normal]Climate change will affect carbon cycle processes in a way that will exacerbate the increase of CO
[normal]2 
[normal]in the atmosphere (
[normal]high confidence
[normal]). Further uptake of carbon by the ocean will increase ocean acidification.
[normal]"
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]22)
[normal]              
[normal]The IPCC say this with 'high confidence' and I concur
[normal] (I come to
[normal] the climate science table through the life and environmental sciences)
[normal].  What is uncertain is 
[normal]the degree of this positive feedback effect which could be more serious than the three lines of this conclusion suggest.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Select Committee question:[bold] 
[normal]To what extent does AR5 reflect the range of views among climate scientists?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]23
[normal]) 
[normal]              
[normal]Views vary largely due 
[normal]to detail and nuance and not the overall IPCC thrust
[normal]              
[normal]If you want a proper answer to this 
[normal]question 
[normal]then a survey needs to be commissioned.  
[normal]I do meet climate change science researchers in committees and at symposia.  
[normal]My own 
[normal](personal and unscientific) 
[normal]take
[normal] with the ecological, Earth system scientists and others involved in c
[normal]limate change research (who
[normal] may not consider themselves to be '
[normal]climatologists
[normal]' 
[normal]('climate scientists') 
[normal]as 
[normal]per
[normal] the subject of the Committee's question) is that there is little that is very
[normal] new in the AR5 report and nothing that necessitates a marked change to current research programmes.  There is therefore little merit to question the 
[normal]AR5 
[normal]conclusions 
[normal]and the climate community views 
[normal]beyond those previously asked of the AR4 assessment
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]Howe
[normal]ver,
[normal] my impression is that the IPCC Assessments are consensus views 
[normal]assembled from experts whose own views 
[normal]vary from individual 
[normal]to individual
[normal] only in nuance and detail, and not 
[normal]with regard to
[normal] the 
[normal]broad, 
[normal]overall IPCC conclusions.
[normal] (I have not discerned a sma
[normal]ll minority whose views markedly differ from the IPCC's overall conclusions but given that I have not 
[normal]personally 
[normal]met many IPCC principal authors it could be I missed them.
[normal] Having said that, I do read the primary literature widely
[normal] and meet a number of scien
[normal]tists whose work feeds in to the IPCC process
[normal].
[normal])
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]Select Committee question:[bold] 
[normal]How robust are the conclusions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis report? Have the IPCC adequately addressed criticisms of previous reports? How much scope is there to question of
[normal] the report’s conclusions?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]24
[normal])
[normal]              
[normal]Most AR4 criticisms relate to WG II and III
[normal]              
[normal]I have an
[normal]swered most of this above.  
[normal]However,
[normal] with regards to 
[normal]addressing criticisms of AR4 it should be noted that most of AR4's criticisms (such as the Himalaya glacier 
[normal]statement) do not relate to the IPCC WG I which focuses on the science, but W
[normal]Gs II and III.  (Remember, WG I-related 
[normal]concerns over things like the Mann hockey-stic
[normal]k graph were raised prior to AR5
[normal] and were
[normal] mainly
[normal] addressed in the AR4 2007 assessment
[normal]'s WG I
[normal].
[normal])  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]25)
[normal]              
[normal]Sea level rise has long been more debatable
[normal]              
[normal]Sea level rise has long been more debatable compared to temperature rise and the IPCC is rightly less specific here (indeed some might say overly cautious)
[normal] but a reading of the academic literature does not (yet) provide a clear picture
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]Select Committee question:[bold] 
[normal]How effective is AR5 and the summary for policymakers in conveying what is meant by 
[normal]uncertainty in scientific terms
[normal]? Would a focus on risk rathe
[normal]r than uncertainty be useful?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]26)
[normal]              
[normal]R
[normal]isk is more the province of WG II and III
[normal]              
[normal]Uncertainty
[normal] has always been difficult to convey outside of science and statisticians.  The IPCC has come up with a system that conveys uncertainty as well as might
[normal] for policy-ma
[normal]kers
[normal]. A focus on 'risk' would be decidedly out of place in WG
[normal] 
[normal]I.  
[normal]'
[normal]Risk
[normal]'
[normal] implies that there is something being risked and hence that there are 
[normal]'
[normal]stakes
[normal]'
[normal] and 'hazard'
[normal].  This takes us into the realm of degree of 
[normal]'
[normal]impacts
[normal]'
[normal] and 
[normal]'
[normal]likelihood thereof
[normal]'
[normal],
[normal] and this is firmly the province of WG II.
[normal]  There is a difference between 'certainty' (or 'probability'), 'risk' and hazard'.  (I am likely to be able to walk ten feet along a joined twin line of bricks laid on the ground without much problem.  However if 
[normal]this two line of bricks was part of a tall
[normal], two-brick wide,
[normal] wall then though (psychology aside) I may still be able to walk it with the same 
[normal]'
[normal]certainty
[normal]'
[normal], the 
[normal]'
[normal]hazard
[normal]'
[normal] if I came off would be much greater.)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Select Committee question: 
[normal]Can any of the areas o
[normal]f the science now be considered settled as a result of AR5’s publication, if so which? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]27)
[normal]              
[normal]Areas settled
[normal]              
[normal]The IPCC's assessments as a whole (1990-2013) portray a clear picture that:
[normal]-
[normal]i
[normal])    The Earth is currently warming
[normal]ii)   The Earth's climate has chan
[normal]ged in the past
[normal]iii)  Climate change has a major impact on natural systems (on which we depend) 
[normal]iv) Current warming is largely due to human activity and the trajectory is unprecedented in human history leading to more
[normal] intense extreme weather events
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Polic
[normal]y-makers should consider t
[normal]hese matters 
[normal]settled
[normal].
[normal]  It is therefore worrying that a still few members of either side of both Houses
[normal] in 
[normal]Westminster
[normal] do not accept 
[normal]the policy-maker (UN) created scientific consensus (IPCC) view.  If these policy-makers will not 
[normal]accept this view, on what authority are they basing their decisions?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]28)
[normal]              
[normal]Good to see long-term business-as-usual forecasts beginning to be considered
[normal]              
[normal]There are a number of new areas of science in the main body of the IPCC text yet to be approved.  I was 
[normal]pleased to see
[normal] (in the draft of chapter 12)
[normal] consideration of RCP 
[normal]8.5 which is 
[normal]effectively continued 
[normal]long-term 
[normal]reliance on fossil fuel
[normal]s (
[normal]including more expensive fossil fuels such as tar sand
[normal]s) beyond the 21st century, as this is the trajectory we are curre
[normal]ntly on (we have yet to begin to stabilise greenhouse emissions and these are still increasing) and policy-makers do need to know where we
[normal] are heading
[normal] if we fail to 
[normal]act 
[normal]decisively. This long-term projection depicts a median temperature rise of around 8°C b
[normal]y 2150 (and I am not sure if this includes permafrost and methane 
[normal]clathrate
[normal] positive feedback
[normal]s
[normal], if not then this warming will be more 
[normal]severe, and if it does
[normal] 
[normal]include
[normal] feedbacks
[normal] this
[normal] 8°C
[normal] is more than severe enough to completely disrupt
[normal] the
[normal] current 
[normal]pattern of 
[normal]agricultural systems globally).  The IPCC has to date been reluctant to look at such a long-term, business-as-usual type scenario.  This I suspect has been because it has not wanted to be overly alarmist and back in 1990 (its first assessment) it 
[normal]possibly 
[normal]did not consider that a quarter of a century on we would still be on its (1990) business-as-usual trajectory.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Select Committee question:[bold] 
[normal]What areas need further effort to reduce the levels of uncertainty?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]29)
[normal]              
[normal]W
[normal]eather and climate hence computers and 
[normal]Earth system modelling need continued effort
[normal]              
[normal]The exact degree of warming and the nature of weather and weather patterns in a warmer world needs further elucidation.  This requires better modelling, both 
[normal]via
[normal] understanding of the Earth system and model exec
[normal]ution which require
[normal]s
[normal] improved computer technology.  The models themselves require increased resolution and improved biological components (including bio-geological components such as soil an
[normal]d marine carbon biosphere res
[normal]ervoirs
[normal]).
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]Currently the race to impr
[normal]ove computer technology and climate models is more or less neck and neck and is likely to continue with
[normal] research
[normal] investment as is.
[normal]  This is a long-term venture and polic
[normal]y-makers need to realise that w
[normal]ith this research we are likely in for the long-haul wit
[normal]h incremental progress continually being made
[normal] over the years
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]30)
[normal]              
[normal]Solar monitoring
[normal]              
[normal]Of lesser concern, solar monitoring is also required and here much is already
[normal] being done or research
[normal] 
[normal]is 
[normal]in train.  However here it will be a while before we have a suffici
[normal]ently long record before 
[normal]major 
[normal]solar uncertainties 
[normal]can be reasonably 
[normal]assessed
[normal].
[normal]  Having said that (and I should say that here I am looking outside my own area of interest and over the shoulders of others), it is unlikely that solar influence will hugely aff
[normal]ect the broad warming trajectory in the long-term 
[normal]we currently foresee, 
[normal]but it might affect decadal warming
[normal] adding a ripple to the longer-term warming trend
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]31)
[normal]              
[normal]Earth system science and crossing critical transitions needs more attention
[normal]              
[normal]What is importan
[normal]t is Earth system (biosphere science) research. 
[normal]Earth system understanding in turn requires continued long-term monitoring and, importantly, improved 
[normal]thermal 
[normal]monitoring of deep seas and abyssal depths.  It also requires better 
[normal]und
[normal]erstanding of 
[normal]palaeoclimat
[normal]es
[normal].  Here t
[normal]he probability of flipping to a new climate state also needs to be considered
[normal] should the Earth
[normal] system
[normal] go through a 'critical transition'
[normal] and cross a climate threshold
[normal].  
[normal]With this in mind, 
[normal]AR4 
[normal](WG I, 2007, pp442-3, in chapter 8, 
[normal]Palaeoclimate
[normal], section 6.3.3) 
[normal]drew attention to the similarities of what we are doing now with what are known as carbon isotope excursion events especially that of the early Eocene 55 million years ago
[normal] (known as the IETM
[normal] or PETM)
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Back then
[normal] it seems as if 
[normal]vulcanic
[normal] greenhouse gas warmed the Earth so inducing the release of organic carbon 
[normal](12-carbon rich) 
[normal]from biosphere reservoirs which enhanced the warming further 
[normal]via
[normal] a positive feedback loop.
[normal] This warming event was 
[normal]initia
[normal]ted within a few centuries, and saw temperature
[normal] rise
[normal], sea level rise, ocean acidification and marked biome (ecosystem assemblages) shift
[normal] 
[normal]pol
[normal]e
[normal]wards
[normal], for around 100,000 years.  Furthermore, we know from carbon isotope (13C/12C) analysis 
[normal]broadly
[normal] the amount of
[normal] 12-carbon isotope rich greenhouse gas involved
[normal],
[normal] and as AR4 noted this was 
[normal]of a
[normal] similar 
[normal]order of magnitude 
[normal]to the amount of carbon we will have likely emitted since the industrial revolution and the end of this century unless radical actions are taken to c
[normal]urb greenhouse gas emissions.
[normal]  It is therefore a shame that the ambition laid out in 
[normal]Agreed Reference Material For The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report
[normal] (2009) that AR5 would see ' [
[normal]Palaeoclimate
[normal]] Abrupt climate changes and their regional expression'
[normal],
[normal] as well a
[normal]s '
[normal]Palaeoclimate
[normal] perspective on irreversibility in the climate system'
[normal],
[normal] was not realised.  Had it been realised AR5 would have most likely seen a further assessment of the PETM / IETM literature as well as that on critical transitions
[normal] and climate threshold
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]32)
[normal]              
[normal]There is a possible policy gap between DECC and DEFRA policy-driven research, an example being managing species shift for both biological conservation and carbon management purposes
[normal]              
[normal]A little beyond the scope of this consultation, but nonetheless r
[normal]elated, is the question of ecological shift.  Given global warming will be inevitable in the absence of major cuts in emissions
[normal] as the WG I 
[normal]Summary for Policymakers 
[normal]makes clear,
[normal], species' range
[normal]s
[normal] will shift.  Yet with some ecosystems (such as woodland) taking many decades to establish, there is a very strong case for species transloca
[normal]tion along climate gradients.  Yet c
[normal]urrently there are no formally agreed protocols for such translocation.  Nor ar
[normal]e their formal networks of dialogue between nature reserves along climate gradients nationally and internationally 
[normal]to
[normal] manage species and ecosystem migration
[normal],
[normal] as well as
[normal] maintaining
[normal] carbon-related ecosystem function
[normal] in addition to biological conservation
[normal].  
[normal]I mention this now as there is concern that some research and policy discussion may fall between DECC and DEFRA stools.  As climate-chang
[normal]e
[normal]-driven species translocation is climate change, and carbon, related it could be argued as to fall under DECC's purvie
[normal]w. 
[normal]Conversely,
[normal] as 
[normal]these are
[normal] to do with environmental conservation it could be seen as the responsibility of DEFRA.  
[normal]Consequently,
[normal] I flag this issue now for your attention.

[normal]Future IPCC forecast portrayals need to be standardised and compared with past 
[normal]B-a-U forecasts
[normal]              
[normal]Each IPCC Assessment has a graph of warming projections over the 21st century.  Here the date the projections commence vary from assessment to assessment and there is no sense given as to how these compare with previous Assessment projecti
[normal]ons. 
[normal]What I would like to see
[normal] 
[normal]in the next IPCC Assessment WG I report (AR6) is for the warming projections to commence from 1990 as that is a key policy date. I would also like to see
[normal] additionally
[normal] a graph of all the IPCC business-as-usual scenarios and the
[normal]ir SRES and RCP analogues from the various Assessments 
[normal](1990-2013 
[normal]etc
[normal]) 
[normal]all on the same graph.  I have actually done this for the assessments up to and including AR4 (2007) and they all fall within the upper and lower estimates for the IPCC 1990 business-as
[normal]-usual scenario: they are (un)surprisingly similar and should lend confidence as to the continuation of message.

[normal]              [bold]Select Committee question:[bold] 
[normal]Has AR5 sufficiently explained the reasons behind the widely reported hiatus in the global surface temperature 
[normal]record?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]34)
[normal]              
[normal]Pause not yet satisfactorily explained
[normal]              
[normal]I have not (yet) come across a detailed examination of this question in AR5 (but this may be because I have not read the whole 
[normal]draft 
[normal]WG I 
[normal]volume 
[normal]thoroughly
[normal])
[normal].  
[normal]Speaking personally, i
[normal]t should be said that we cannot say exactly why the global surface record has 
[normal]ceased to show an overall warming trend the past one-and-a-half decades since near the end of the 20th century.  Having said that
[normal],
[normal] this 'pause' is not that particularly unexpecte
[normal]d and th
[normal]ere a
[normal]re a number of possible explanations
[normal] for it
[normal].  It is 'not unexpected' because we have had pauses before. The period from 1940 – 1980 was a previous pause.  
[normal]Yet
[normal], because there is now more anthropogenic greenhouse gas in the atmosphere today comp
[normal]ared to back then, and 
[normal]because
[normal] atmospheric greenhouse concentrations are continuing to rise, we might expect this current pause to be shorter.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]35)
[normal]              
[normal]The long pause was predicted
[normal]              
[normal]Furthermore, this pause is not only 
[normal]'
[normal]not unusual
[normal]'
[normal] it was actually predicted by
[normal] at least one team half a decade ago that the then short warming pause would continue (Yu 
[normal]Kosaka
[normal] &amp; Shang-Ping 
[normal]Xie
[normal], 2008, 
[normal]Nature
[normal] 
[normal]501,[bold] 403-7). They predicted that the N. Atlantic would cool as would the Pacific. 
[normal](Their reasons 
[normal]hypothesised 
[normal]were 
[normal]weather/clima
[normal]te
[normal] cycle and 
[normal]Broecker
[normal] global 
[normal]thermohaline
[normal] circulation related.)
[normal] 
[normal]They said
[normal] that such cooling may be so great as to impede the current warming trend.  They.. 
[normal]"
[normal]conclude that the recent cooling of the tropical Pacific and hence the current hiatus are probably 
[normal]due to natural internal variability rather than a forced response. If so, the hiatus is temporary, and global warming will return when the tropical Pacific swings back to a warm state. Similar hiatus events may occur in the future..
[normal]."  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]36)
[normal]              
[normal]The question 
[normal]of importance is where has the heat gone?
[normal]              
[normal]More recently other work points to the El Niño cycle (again the Pacific
[normal] related
[normal])
[normal] as the cause of the pause
[normal].  There are other 
[normal]explanations that
[normal] may or may not have a significant bearing on the problem and these inc
[normal]lude our lack of 
[normal]a spatially 
[normal]detailed long-term Arctic record.  Irrespectively, the hiatus in the global surface temperature record does not undermine the IPCC consensus view.
[normal]  Here t
[normal]he 
[normal]real 
[normal]issue of concern is what has happened to the 'missing' heat?  The
[normal] obvious suggestion is that this has gone into the oceans and this is worrying as 
[normal]that
[normal] will eventually lead to marine methane 
[normal]clathrate
[normal] destabilization
[normal] with the release of methane and additional warming above and beyond that incurred by direct human emissi
[normal]ons
[normal].

[normal]Select Committee question: 
[normal]Do the AR5 Physical Science Basis report’s conclusions strengthen or weaken the economic case for action to prevent dangerous climate change?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]37)
[normal]              
[normal]They affirm
[normal] the case
[normal]              
[normal]They affirm
[normal] the case already made.  
[normal]AR5 I
[normal] contains nothing I can see
[normal],
[normal] from my reading
[normal] of the rest of the WG I report 
[normal]so far
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]that 
[normal]in any way undermine
[normal]s
[normal] the case previously made
[normal] by earlier IPCC Assessments

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Select Committee question:[bold] 
[normal]What implications do the IPCC’s conclusions in the AR5 Physica
[normal]l Science Basis report have for policy making both nationally and internationally? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]38)
[normal]              
[normal]AR5 affirms previous assessments' policy relevance
[normal]              
[normal]The implications are that since AR4 (2007) new science affirms previous understanding, that current unaltered 
[normal]emission trends remain on an unfavourable trajectory
[normal], and that we may well exceed the 2°
[normal]C so-called 'safe' warming limit
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]39)
[normal]              
[normal]Irrespective of climate change, medium-to-log-term finite fossil fuel economics necessitate weaning off of fossil carbon.
[normal]              
[normal]At thi
[normal]s point I would like to take leave of the IPCC and draw the Committee
[normal]'
[normal]s attention to the implications of the world continuing its addiction to fossil carbon.  Irrespective of climate change concerns, fossil fuel consumption is increasing.  Yet we all know too well that fossil fuels are finite.  The cheap fossil fuel 
[normal]reserves
[normal] go
[normal] first
[normal] leaving more expensive reserves
[normal] for later use
[normal].  This drives up prices.  World population is
[normal] also
[normal] growing and so demand for fossil fuel rises. This too drives up prices.  
[normal]These 
[normal]different 
[normal]increased pressures on price act synergistically. 
[normal]The long-t
[normal]erm, real-term cost of fossil fuel is 
[normal]inevitably 
[normal]set to increase.  It is therefore in nations' interests to switch to non-fossil fuel energy
[normal] irrespective of climate change arguments
[normal]. 
[normal](This 
[normal]case
[normal] 
[normal]was
[normal] at the heart of 
[normal]Climate and Human Change: Disaster or Oppo
[normal]rtunity?

[normal])
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]Only short-termism gives any grounds for not cold-
[normal]Turkeying
[normal] from fossil fuel.
[normal]  Delaying
[normal] 
[normal]matters by kicking the issue into the long grass simply makes things worse for future g
[normal]enerations.
[normal]  Add back in IPCC climate concerns and it really is inexcusable
[normal] (arguably 
[normal]a wanton dereliction of duty
[normal])
[normal] in terms of both national and global interest
[normal] for policy-makers
[normal] to
[normal] avoid

[normal]              
[normal]Select Committee question: [bold]Is the IPCC process an effective mechanism for assessing scientific knowledge? Or has it focussed on providing a justification for political commitment?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]41)
[normal]              
[normal]There is more than a little 
[normal]post hoc ergo propter hoc
[normal] about this question.  Let us be clear, policy-makers (those concerned with political commitment) through the United Nations (UN) called for 
[normal] 
[normal]i
[normal].
[normal] an assessment of climate change science, and
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]ii
[normal]. formulation of realistic response strategies.  The UN in turn
[normal] called 
[normal]upon
[normal] two of its agencies (the UN Environment Programme and World Meteorological
[normal] Organiz
[normal]ation
[normal]) to establish the IPCC and this they did in 1988.  That the IPCC has provided a sufficiently clear picture
[normal],
[normal] that demonstrates that political commitment is 
[normal]warranted
[normal],
[normal] is neither a failing of the IPCC nor an indication that there is some sort of bias.  Climate change has been an issue on 
[normal]the formal agenda of the World's political leaders at least since 1972 and the UN Conference on the Human Environment that y
[normal]ear.  Since then climate change has formally been on the political agenda at the UN level as well as to varying degrees on the national-level agenda of a number of 
[normal]UN
[normal] member states.  The IPCC itself does not define what political action should be taken: it
[normal] simply
[normal] provides information.  That climate change is an issue of political concern precedes the IPCC and was the reason for it
[normal]s formation
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]              
[normal]Try replacing 'the IPCC process' and 'it' in the question with 'evidence gathering' and it is clear that the qu

[normal]Select Committee question: [bold]Is the rate at which the UK Government intends to cut CO2 emissions appropriate in light of the findings of the IPCC AR5 Physical Science Basis report?

[normal]46
[normal])
[normal]              
[normal]Cuts policy about right
[normal]              
[normal]Given global emissions, the rate of cuts needs to be increased so as to attempt to avoid serious warming.  However both pragmatically, and in actuality (as the UK is only responsible for a small proportion of global emissions), this is not possible.  Curre
[normal]nt 
[normal]UK 
[normal]policies are therefore probably about right.

[normal]              
[normal]I am pleased to respond as an independent scientist who has over the years reviewed the academic literature for university-level texts of climate change as well as engaged/organised a number of climate and energy-related ventures for learned societies.  I 
[normal]have never received research grants or in the past three decades been employed by a research institute or energy sector employer.  My most recent climate-change-related work of substance was 
[normal]Climate Change: Biological and Human Aspects
[normal] (2013) from Cambridg
[normal]e U. Press.  My views are therefore not 
[normal]prejudiced
[normal] by monetary concerns from industry or academia, other than indirectly in the form of book royalties should any from those sectors purchase my texts.
