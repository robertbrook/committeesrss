"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence by Germains Seed Technology&#xa0;\nIntroduction to Germains Seed Technology&#xa0;\nGermains Seed Technology is a wholly owned subsidiary of Associated British Foods plc (ABF), a diversified food, ingredients and retail group with 2013 sales of £13.3 billion and 113,000 employees in 47 countries.  ABF has a primary relationship with the UK Government through the Strategic Relationship Management (SRM) initiative, for which its sponsor departments are DEFRA, BIS, and UKTI.\n&#xa0;\nGermains Seed Technology has world-leading expertise in seed technology and provides technology driven services which enable growers to maximise the benefits of precision farming.  Germains’ enabling technologies include seed priming, pelleting, treatment and health.    Although its headquarters are in the UK, in the key agricultural area of East Anglia, Germains has a global presence with facilities in Europe and the USA, employing 200 people in total, of whom 90 are located in the UK.  Its crop species focus is sugar beet and horticulture.\n&#xa0;\nGermains Seed Technology responseAs requested, we have addressed our comments to the questions posed in the inquiry paper. As not all questions were relevant to us, our responses below cover questions 1, 3 and 4. \nQuestion 1: How best to improve UK (and EU) food security, including using resources more efficiently? \n \n2\nFood security is a global challenge which affects all areas of agriculture and rural development. Focusing on the UK (and the EU), demand for quality, affordable food is increasing from a rapidly increasing population.  Conversely, land availability is limited, if not dwindling, for extensive agricultural use (low productivity model).  Producing more from \nthe \navailable resource\ns\n is critical to maintain regular food supply: This will meet consumer demand for the right quality and price point and will limit the \nneed for\n often unreliable and price disruptive practices of emergency imports.\nIntensive agriculture models focus on high productivity (yield per hectare/acre) leading to more profitability for farming enterprises, which become more attuned to preserving biodiversity and ecological habitat\ns\n.  Indeed, by increasing the land availability for non-food production, ecosystems and natural habitats can be restored and will thrive. It is therefore strategically important to limit land expansion for agricultural use and this can only be achieved by maximising output per land area. Conversely, low productivity models (extensive systems) require more land and water, producing lower yields, which are less profitable and are contributing to an increased agriculture footprint for GHG emissions, as well as reducing the availability of natural habitats.\n2 \nThe UK has been a long time leader in efficiency and innovation in agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry and food production.  The UK has some of the largest consolidated land areas under farm management, which enable productivity initiatives on a large and efficient scale.  Profitable farming enables non-crop initiatives which can, in turn benefit the ecosystems and countryside habitats for natural flora and fauna. For the UK, the sustainable model for food security and increased resource efficiency is:\nIn 1995, Germains Seed Technology introduced the first high performance seed priming technology on sugar beet seed.  Seed priming is a non-chemical process which improves the germination and field emergence characteristics of seed as follows:\nSuccessive, improved priming technologies developed by Germains have brought in total a 12% increase in sugar beet yield over the past 18 years, as demonstrated in multiyear independent trials carried out in the UK, the EU and the USA.   Improvements such as these, as well as improved seed varieties and targeted crop protection have contributed to an increase in sugar beet yield of 40% over the past 20 years, therefore reducing inputs and costs, whilst increasing unit output profitability and reducing GHG emission footprint and impact on habitat. Over the past 20 years, increases in yield and output per hectare have enabled the release of land area grown for sugar beet by up to 40%, encouraging diversification in cropping strategies and biodiversity benefits.\nQuestion 3: The implications of volatility in global food supply and demand for UK food security\n; \n2\nA strong and consistent approach to self-reliance on the production of base commodities is pivotal to withstand the effect of global supply and demand on prices.  This is particularly relevant in the UK and EU, where domestic prices, if unstable, can affect production decisions for short term gains and inhibit investment in R&amp;D and destabilise beneficial industrial capacity.  If fluctuating prices and ineffective food production ensues, the effect on domestic and global food security is worsened and this impacts third world countries which can least afford it.\nFAO estimates that world demand for food will increase by 70% \nby\n 2050.  Of the projected 10 billion humans in 2050, ca. 4 billion will remain below the hunger threshold unless productivity increases are achieved using high productivity models.  Unless developed nations maintain a strong and sustainable productive agriculture, price volatility will remain and food shortages will increase.  For the UK, this means a consistent and profitable agriculture which has low reliance on global food supply.  \nAny reduction in productivity in the EU will have to be compensated by imports.  The net effect of this would be to encourage low productivity imports entering the EU market which could deplete already impoverished local markets.  The impact in some world regions could be ecologically disastrous with increased use of scarce or critically endangered resources, such as water and virgin land converted to agriculture.\nQuestion 4: The potential value and contribution of science and GM technology to UK food security\n;\na. GM technology \nGM technology can offer many benefits to productivity models and enhanced food quality:\nHowever, the EU and Member states must adopt a common and carefully managed approach to acceptance and monitoring of this technology in the current cropping system and its impact on the environment and human health.  There also must be an improvement in the acceptance process between Member States and the Commission on developing the right path from approval to use.\nb. Crop protection \n1\nCrop protection science plays a pivotal role in innovation and technology transfer to benefit agriculture.  For example, seed treatments now provide the sugar beet crop with over 96% of its protection from insect and fungal pests – this alone represents a reduction in crop insecticide applications of 90%.\nSugar beet yellowing virus diseases in Europe and the UK have virtually disappeared over the past 15 years, thanks to the control afforded by \nneonicotinoid \nseed treatments and applied research\n in this innovation\n. \nSeed treatments\n have enabled a fundamental change in farm practices, in which pesticide applications are now targeted and micro-applied to seed instead of being indiscriminately applied to the soil.  Should these treatments become unavailable, sugar beet yield could be reduced significantly and these losses are estimated, on a year on year basis, at £7 million to the industry.  \nPolitical decisions taken at EU level can have a severe consequential impact on basic crop commodity markets and profitability for all actors in the supply chain\n,\n \nwhich can\n affect research objectives profoundly.  For example, the EU Commission’s unilateral decision to implement a two year ban on neonicotinoid seed treatments on flowering crops, which was made without the outright majority support of Member States, was based on incomplete and limited scientific premise\ns\n allud\ning\n to \nalleged \nnegative impacts on the health of \nbees and other insect \npollinators.  \nHowever, p\nollinator decline is a multi-factorial event, which spans over 40 years, long before the introduction of the seed treatments mentioned \nabove, \nand wider research should have taken place prior to \nsuch drastic measures being applied under \nthe \n‘\nprecautionary principle\n’\n. The effect of the ban will be:\nc. Plant breeding\nSeed v\nariety research is a critical component of productivity.  National trials validate the economic and agronomic value of seed varieties, granting approvals only for the superior cultivars. Plant breeding science and agronomic science therefore plays a significant role for the continual improvement in yield of crops. \nd. Seed technology\nInnovation in seed technology is a continual process backed by fundamental and applied research.  Precision planting as an example was enabled by the use of seed coatings and pellets, which are now standard in sugar beet and vegetable productions, reducing seed cost and improving field work efficiencies.  \nPriming technology is now a standard tool used for many agronomic and horticultural seed species to increase the viability of young seedlings in a wide range of challenging growing conditions, thus maximising merchantable yields per hectare/acre. \nSome biological substances can play an increasing primary or complementary role as elicitors of plant natural defence mechanisms when confronted with pests and diseases.  Application of such substances onto seed is a new area of research we are developing.  The benefits of this technology are to enable more accurately targeted dose rates and localised placement in the field. Exploitation of naturally occurring substances for complementary or replacement strategies can offer entirely novel approaches to sustainable food production and security.\n4 December 2013&#xa0;References:\n&#xa0;\n \nAnnals of Applied Biology research papers 1990 and 2004\n.\n2 \n  \nHumboldt Forum for Food and Agriculture e.V.
