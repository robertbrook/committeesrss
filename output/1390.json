"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Paul MK Dodgshun (HOT04)Summary:1:  Scientific Theory:  In respect of heat pumps the draft RHI policy, published on the 12\nth\n July, is scientifically incorrect on two counts.  It disregards the consequences of :- \n              \n1.1:  Carnot's Law [\n1:\n&#x200e;\n]  , and \n1.2:  Ohm's Law, I2R losses and power factor [\n2: 3: 4:\n].\n&#xa0;\n2:  Domestic Heat Pumps:2.1:  Maximum Efficiency:The policy should mandat\ne the use of the most Carnot efficient pumps that are commercially available.  These are pumps of the air-to-air type and they can achieve a headline Coefficient of Performance (COP) that is greater than 5.5.  All heat pump types with lower comparable COPs\n should be suppressed by the policy, unless extenuating circumstances apply; this is a consequence of 1.1:.  If implemented, this proposal will halve electricity bills compared to inefficient air-to-water pumps, currently promoted by the RHPP and proposed \nby the draft RHI.  Failure to implement this proposal will result in double the Carbon burn for running domestic heat pumps.\n&#xa0;\n2.2:  Capacity:Each household to be allowed only 1kWe of Grid supplied heat pump capacity.  Spread over 8.6 million households th\nat produces a maximum generation demand of 8.6GW (10% of current grid capacity).  This maximum demand will appear for most of the winter as a continuous (modulated air-to-air heat pumps run continuously) load on the electricity grid.  Homes with pre-existi\nng fossil fired boilers should retain those boilers, new homes have them fitted where practicable.\n&#xa0;\n3:  National Gas and Electricity Grid and Distribution:3.1:  Electricity Grid and Distribution:2.2: is a consequence of 1.2: in respect of the National El\nectricity Grid and distribution network.  The 1kWe of electricity proposed in 2.2: will be doubly effective, if supplied to efficient air-to-air pumps as compared to air-to-water pumps. Supplied to air-to-air pumps, 1kWe will supply about 4kW of heat per p\nump at freezing (0C).  If full-sized, inefficient air-to-water pumps are permitted, maximum generation capacity on the grid may need to be double the current (about 86GW) level.  \n&#xa0;\nDoubled generation capacity means doubled conductor cross-sections and doub\nled transformer capacities in the whole of the distribution network, if line and transformer losses, currently 8%, are not to rise.  Grid line losses, currently 3%, may be prevented from rising by higher grid voltages and/or greater conductor cross-section\ns, but transformer replacement will be needed.  Localised gas fired generation, mostly in the south, should require less long distance transportation of electricity.\n&#xa0;\n3.2:  Gas Grid:There is an interaction between the gas grid and the electricity grid, as\n gas is diverted from \ndomestic consumption to gas fired electricity generation.  Ideal sites for this generation  would be where electricity grid substations and gas grid pipes are co-located, along with adequate water.  The appropriate percentage of diver\nsion is the question; it does not have to be 0% or 100%, and that is a cardinal error in the draft RHI policy.\n______________________________________________\n[1:]  \nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnot's_theorem_(thermodynamics)\n&#x200e;\n[2:]  \nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_l\naw  \n              \n              \n[3:]  \nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_loss \n[4:]\n en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_factor\n              \n              \n[5:]\n4:  The government is currently subsidising and encouraging the sale of heat pumps that use twice as much electricity as the best alternative.  That means double s\nized electricity bills that will continue for the life of the equipment; the subsidies do not cover the losses.  The subsidies are an expensive trap for the pump owner and a waste of money for the taxpayer.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5:  The draft RHI policy should be redrafted to\n offer to give every household a 1kWe heat pump of the highest Carnot Efficiency air-to-air type.  This would cost less than £1000+fitting per pump.  All other subsidies for heat pumps should be withdrawn.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6:  Soon, the government will have to ban the \ninstallation of heat pumps greater than 1kWe in size and then only one per house, unless they are supported by self-generation.  Any additional heat load is to be supplied by fossil fired equipment (boilers, stoves, fires or whatever) or night storage heat\ners.  In most cases, this is likely to be pre-existing equipment.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7:  My proposal, 1kwE per house, requires a capped 10% increase in generation capacity (8.6GW).  Inefficient(x2) full-sized(x10) pumps could require a 200% increase, alongside massive grid\n reinforcement.  There is no economic case for :-\n7.1:  a 200% increase in grid capacity,\n7.2:  a 200% increase in generation capacity, and\n7.3:  a full-sized inefficient fleet of 8.6 million heat pumps;\nthat runs at high load for only a few cold days in t\nhe year, instead :-\n7.4:  no increase in grid capacity, albeit with a few days of increased grid losses,\n7.5:  a 10% increase in generation capacity, and\n7.6:  a 1kWe air-to-air heat pump per house\nsuffices to achieve the objective, a minimum Carbon burn. \nAt sub-zero temperatures, heat pumps become inefficient and taken over the full CCGT/grid/distribution/heat pump route they become no more efficient than boilers and much poorer than boilers, if grid reinforcement is not extensive.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n8:  Heat pumps have an\nother serious efficiency problem: part load running.  When run at low to very low part loads, even the best modulated pumps, have very poor Carnot efficiencies.  When sized for heating a house at minimum design temperatures, perhaps -15C, they inevitably r\nun at low to very low part loads at more average temperatures.  To combat this problem, small pumps need to be fitted that can hold a house (20C) temperature down to about freezing (0C) ambient temperature.  My proposal also does this; a 1kW(electrical)/4k\nW(thermal) heat pump will hold the temperature of my house at my winter quarter average (100kWh per day, stated by my gas bill) load, based on continuous (4x24=96kWh per day) running.  My house is a five bed, detached with double glazing, loft and cavity i\nnsulation; if it works for my house, then it will for 95% of the others.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n9:  The most efficient heat pump is a good air-to-air pump, running continuously at full load, with a minimum temperature drop across its refrigerant circuit.  Anything else involve\ns wasted electricity.\n______________________________________________\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;2: Introduction:2.1: I am a retired mechanical engineer from the nuclear power industry.  After working at Longannet, Hunterston 'B' and Heysham Power Stations, I joined the staff of \na small engineering team preparing and evaluating nuclear safety cases in support of nuclear power stations in the south-east of England.\n&#xa0;\n2.2: In June, I was cold-called by a company who wished to sell me a heat pump.  I agreed to accept a sales engineer's visit to my house.  When the sales engineer asked for my order, I responded with 'due diligence first'.  Due diligence continues.  \n&#xa0;\n2.3:\n The insights gained allow me to address the committee's following questions :-\n2.3.1: \n              \nQ1 - Why does the RHI not seem to promote heat pumps successfully? \n              \nA1 - Because it has got the fundamental science wrong.\n&#xa0;\n2.3.2: \n              \nQ2 - What are the relative merits o\nf using gas to directly provide space heating compared to centralised electricity production plus domestic heat pumps?\n              \nA2 – Capacity balance should be about 90% gas/fossil fuel, 10% air-to-air heat pump.  Heat production balance is then about 10% gas/foss\nil fuel, 90% air-to-air heat pump. Use of gas/fossil fuel occurs when it is as efficient as or more efficient than the heat pump, taken over the full CCGT/grid/distribution/heat pump route (i.e. at sub-zero temperatures).  This balance has the minimum Carb\non burn and the minimum capital cost over the generation/grid/distribution/heat pump route as compared to the boiler route.\n&#xa0;\n2.3.3: \n              \nQ3 - How successful will the RHI be when rolled out to households?\n              \nA3 – In respect of heat pumps, disastrous unless totall\ny redrafted.\n______________________________________________\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3: Facts:3.1:  Carnot's Law:Carnot's Law states that the theoretical maximum efficiency of a heat pump is equal to Thot/(Thot-Tcold) where temperatures are stated in degrees absolute (e.g. fr\neezing is 273C and boiling is 373C)\nCOP 5/30=(273+30)/(30-5)=303/25=12.12\nCOP 5/60=(273+60)/(60-5)=333/55=6.05\n12.12/6.05= 2\nThis is the basis of the statement that air-to-air pumps that blow air at 30C are twice as efficient as air-to-water pumps that use\n hot wet radiators at 60C.\n&#xa0;\nReal heat pumps deliver less than the theoretical maximum, perhaps 0.4 to 0.6 forms the main range.  Part load coefficients at loads below 50% start to deteriorate rapidly to 0 at 0% part load  e.g. If the theoretical Carnot eff\niciency is x, the pump factor is 0.5 and the part load factor is also 0.5, then the overall efficiency of the pump is x/4.  The Carnot efficiency of resistive heating is 1.0.\n&#xa0;______________________________________________\n&#xa0;&#xa0;3.2:  I2R Losses in Transformers and Cables on the National Grid and Distribution NetworksCurrent losses on the National Grid are about 3%.\nCurrent losses on the Distribution Network are about 8%.\n&#xa0;\nIf 8.6 million homes have 10kW(electrical) heat pumps fitted, then this is a \ncapacity demand on the grid system of 86GW, approximately equal to the currently installed capacity.\nIf this doubles line and transformer currents, then the I2R losses quadruple to (3+8)*4=44%.\n&#xa0;\nThe I2R losses heat the lines and transformers which have the\nrmal overload protection.  At some point the protection will start 'tripping' and supply breakers will open.  The result may be blackouts.\n&#xa0;\nMajor reinforcement of the grid and distribution networks would be needed, right down to the 415V transformers that \nsupply houses.  If the cabling needs reinforcing, that means digging up the roads.\n&#xa0;\nMy current domestic electrical load is about 10kWh per day, all year.\nMy current domestic gas load is an average of about 100kWh per day during winter and 10kWh per day in \nthe summer.\n&#xa0;\nTransferring all my winter demand to the electrical supply will increase my peak demand on the electrical supply by a factor of about 11.  I have no reason to think that my consumption is atypical.\n&#xa0;\n10/11ths of that higher electrical load will\n be continuous over the colder days, with peaks in the remaining 1/11 that mirror the current 24 hour demand curve of the grid.  When a pre-existing grid peak combines with a heat pump load peak, then what is the demand on, 1: local supply transformers, an\nd 2:  power station capacity?\n&#xa0;\nIt is the local supply transformers that receive the greatest increase.  The power station load rises by a factor of 2 but the domestic supply transformers experience an 11 fold rise.  Local supply transformers are sized 'sto\nchastically'; they are already too small for all the total installed load in the attached houses and presumably their supply cables are similarly sized.  An 11-fold increase in cable cross-sections and transformers is predicted on the 415V system.  I2R los\nses have a major effect on the draft RHI policy.  There has to be a better way and there is:  the 1kWe capacity air-to-air heat pump, installed one per house.\n______________________________________________\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;3.3: Efficiencies and Coefficients of Performance (COPs)The draft domestic RHI policy is about the comparative efficiency of two routes :-\n1:  generator/grid/distribution/heat pump, and\n2:  domestic boiler.\n&#xa0;\nThe best gas turbine generators achieve about 0.65 efficiency\nBig steam turbines \nachieve about 0.35\nGrid losses are currently about 3%, so 0.97\nDistribution losses are currently about 8%, so 0.92\n&#xa0;\nThe efficiency of domestic pure resistive heating from :-\n1: gas generated grid supplied electricity is .65x.97x.92x1.0\n              \n= 0.58\n2: steam turb\nine, grid supplied electricity is .35x.97x.92x1.0\n              \n= 0.31\n&#xa0;\nThe highest(65%) generation efficiencies come from CCGT plant; the highest heat pump headline COPs(5.5+) come from air-to-air pumps .\n&#xa0;\nClearly, the most efficient overall system requires the highest\n generation efficiencies, coupled with the lowest grid and distribution losses and the heat pumps with the highest COPs (.65x.97x.92x5.5= 3.19).  \n&#xa0;\nThe poorest system is steam turbine electricity, through overloaded grid/distribution to a resistive load (.\n35x.86x.72x1.0\n              \n= 0.22).\n&#xa0;\nThe ratio of best to worst is 3.19/0.22=14.5. \n It is a very large number and graphically illustrates the potential benefit of heat pumps, PROVIDED  that ALL the technology involved is operating at optimum efficiency.   1: Generation, 2: grid, 3: distribution, and 4: heat pump efficiencies have to be individually maximised to achieved the combined desired result, whilst noting that the gas grid can help in a major way.______________________________________________\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Efficiency Tables:Note:  This is purely an efficiency analysis; it does not consider prices\n              \n3.19 is the ceiling efficiency for this exercise.\n&#xa0;3.3.1:  Heat Pump COPs at -15C are poor, so 1.53.3.1.1:  \n              \n1: .65x.97x.92x1.5\n              \n= 0.87\n              \n              \n2: boiler\n              \n              \n= 0.85\nComparative \nefficiency: equal\nConclusion: Fossil fired boilers are just as efficient as heat pumps and that is before heavy line losses are considered.\n&#xa0;\n3.3.1.2:  If grid and distribution currents double, then line and transformer losses quadruple (so-called I squared\n R losses) :-\nThis also implies the same line and transformer losses for all the grid load, not just the heat pump load.  This comment applies to all subsequent cases (double grid/distribution losses).              \n              \n1:

0.69)Conclusion: The use of heat pumps with heavy line losses is a non-starter.\n&#xa0;\nOverall Conclusion:  Everyone should be using a fossil fired \nboiler at temperatures of -15C because doubling the grid/distribution system and installing matching gas generator capacity is a very expensive business, particularly when you consider that it is only fully used on a few coldest days of the year.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.3.2:  Heat Pump COPs assumed to be 2.03.3.2.1:  \n              \n1: .65x.97x.92x2.0\n              \n= 1.16\n              \n              \n2: boiler\n

condition.______________________________________________\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
