defaultIntroductiondefault&#xa0;
default1.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOfcom is the independent regulator and competition authority for the UK communications industries.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUnder t
defaulthe Communications Act 2003, Ofcom is required to set standards for programmes on television and radio in order to secure a range of objectives, such that news on television and radio services is presented with due impartiality and due accuracy and that broadcasters preserve due impartiality on matters of political or industrial controversy and matters relating to current public policy. 
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOfcom is also required under the Act to put these standards in a code. In 2005, Ofcom published the first version of the Ofcom Broadcasting Code which sets out these standards in the form of rules that broadcasters must abide by. This Code applies to all 
defaultbroadcasters licensed by Ofcom. A copy of the current version of our Broadcasting Code (dated 21 March 2013) can be found on our website
default.

defaultOfcom’sdefault role during electionsdefault&#xa0;
default1.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOfcom has a clearly defined set of duties in relation to elections in the UK. In summary, these are in the following two areas:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultParty Election Broadcastsdefault&#xa0;
default1.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUnder section 333 of the Act, Ofcom is required to make rules
default determining the political parties on whose behalf party political and referendum broadcasts may be made, including party election broadcasts, which are broadcasts allocated to registered parties during election campaigns. The television and radio channels obliged to carry party election broadcasts are Channels 3, 4 and 5, Classic FM, Talksport and Absolute AM. The BBC and S4C also allocate party political and referendum broadcasts on a similar basis. However, the Ofcom rules on Party Political and Referendum Broadcasts do not apply to the BBC or S4C.
default&#xa0;
default1.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Ofcom rules on Party Political and Referendum Broadcasts contain minimum requirements set by Ofcom which broadcasters must abide by in deciding the allocation, length, frequency and scheduling of party election broadcasts. Ofcom applies the Ofcom rules on party political and referendum broadcasts in determining any disputes in relation to party election broadcasts referred to it by a political party or broadcaster.
default&#xa0;
default1.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe current version of the Ofcom rules on Party Political and Referendum Broadcasts was published on 21 March 2013
default following a public consultation. In its consultation, Ofcom in particular sought views on changing the rules to ensure they cover the new local television services
default that are beginning to launch
default throughout the UK.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultBroadcasters’ editorial coverage during electionsdefault&#xa0;
default1.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is no obligation on any broadcaster to transmit any of its own broadcast coverage of election campaigns. However, if a broadcaster chooses to do so, it must ensure that the programming complies with the Broadcasting Code. Broadcasters will typically cover election campaigns in the form of news and current affairs programmes. This coverage must comply with the following two sections of the Broadcasting Code in particular:
default&#xa0;
defaultSection Five (due impartiality)
default 
default&#xa0;
default1.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSection Five of the Broadcasting Code requires broadcasters to ensure that they reflect alternative viewpoints in their output when they are dealing with “matters of political or industrial controversy and matters of current public policy”.
default&#xa0;
defaultSection Six (elections)
default 
default&#xa0;
default1.10
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDue to their importance, elections are automatically regarded under the Broadcasting Code (see Rule 6.1) as “matters of 
defaultmajor
default political or industrial controversy and 
defaultmajor
default matters of current public policy [emphasis added]”. As a result, as well as the rules in Section Five applying, special rules laid out in Section Six of the Code also apply during election periods. In summary, these rules affect two types of broadcast content about elections:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultMajor partiesdefault&#xa0;
default1.11
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBoth the Broadcasting Code and the Ofcom rules on Party Political and Referendum Broadcasts afford a special status to the major political parties. The Ofcom list of major parties reflects the fact that some political parties have a significant level of electoral support, and number of elected representatives, across a range of elections within the UK or the devolved nations. Until March 2013, the list of major parties was listed in both the Ofcom rules on Party Political and Referendum Broadcasts and Section Six of the Broadcasting Code. However, following our consultation
default revising the Ofcom rules on Party Political and Referendum Broadcasts, and in response to stakeholder concerns that the existing list of major parties was too inflexible, we removed the list of major parties from the Ofcom rules on Party Political and Referendum Broadcasts and Section Six of the Code. Instead we placed the list in a standalone annex to both documents
default, so that it can be reviewed periodically in an efficient way.
default&#xa0;
default1.12
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs a result, we have been conducting our first consultation since March 2013
default on possible changes to the list of major parties ahead of the European Parliamentary elections due to take place on 22 May 2014. We intend to publish any new list of major parties by early March 2014.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Ofcom Election Committeedefault&#xa0;
default1.13
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn carrying out its duty to regulate broadcast content related to elections, Ofcom may convene its Election Committee
default. This is a delegated committee of the Ofcom Board whose role is to consider and adjudicate on complaints received with regard to: the allocation by Ofcom licensed broadcasters of party election broadcasts; the scheduling of party election broadcasts, or their duration; and, due impartiality in programmes transmitted by Ofcom licensed broadcasters during an election period.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Broadcasting Code and General Election debate casesdefault&#xa0;default1.14
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSince the Broadcasting Code was introduced in 2005, Ofcom has recorded a number of breaches of the rules in Sections Five and Six of the Code. Details of our decisions can be found in 
defaultour fortnightly Broadcast Bulletin
default. Although these breaches of the rules were concerned with a variety of issues, they were all principally concerned with a lack of due impartiality in certain broadcast editorial coverage of elections, and contraventions of the rather technical rules in Section Six about 
defaultconstituency/electoral area reporting.
default&#xa0;
default1.15
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt should be underlined that Ofcom is a post-broadcast regulator. This means that Ofcom has no role in determining the structure, format and style of any broadcast General Election debates that might take place in future. Rather, our concern would be whether any election debates comply with the rules in relation to due impartiality and elections in Sections Five and Six of the Code once they have been broadcast. It is worth noting that in the 2010 General Election, Ofcom was required to reach and publish decisions in relation to two
default of the Election debates that took place.  
default&#xa0;
default1.16
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe ITV 1 Debate
default: Ofcom received separate complaints from the Scottish National Party (“the SNP”) and Plaid Cymru concerning the ITV1 Debate, broadcast on 15 April 2010. In summary, the two parties each considered that ITV1 had breached the Code rules on due impartiality by not including the SNP and Plaid Cymru in this Election Debate. In response to these complaints, Ofcom convened its Election Committee. In summary, the Election Committee decided that the SNP
default and Plaid Cymru’s
default complaints should not be upheld. This was because principally this Election Debate was presented as an opportunity to hear from the three major UK political parties, one or more of which had a realistic prospect of forming the next UK Government. In addition, ITV1 signalled to the audience for the Election Debate that viewers in the devolved nations could see separate televised debates between leading figures of the major parties in those nations (including the SNP and Plaid Cymru as appropriate) on issues of policy most relevant to those nations. 
default&#xa0;
default1.17
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Sky News Debate
default: Ofcom received 671 complaints about the Sky News Debate, broadcast on 22 April 2010. In particular complainants objected to a reference, by the Sky News debate moderator Adam Boulton to a critical newspaper story about Nick Clegg. Complainants considered that Adam Boulton’s comment showed bias against the Liberal Democrats, because he made no such personal references to David Cameron or Gordon Brown. Others complained about alleged breaches of the agreement governing the format of the Election Debates, drawn up between broadcasters and the political parties participating in the Debates, and aspects of the presentation and format of the Sky News Debate. On 5 July 2010, Ofcom published its 
defaultdecision
default in relation to the Sky News Debate. In summary, Ofcom did not uphold any of the complaints it had received concerning this Debate. This was for the following reasons:
