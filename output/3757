default&#xa0;defaultAbout the Local Government defaultAssociationdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultLocal Government Association (LGA)
default is the national voice of local government.  We work with councils to support, promote and improve local government.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are a politically-led, cross party organisation which works on behalf of councils to
default ensure local government has a strong, credible voice with national government.  We aim to influence and set the political agenda on the issues that matter to councils so they are able to deliver local solutions to national problems. The LGA
default covers every p
defaultart of England and Wales
default, supporting local government as the most efficient and accountable part of the public sector.

defaultSummarydefault&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQ: Is cycling safe, particularly in towns and cities?default&#xa0;
defaultThe risks of cycling need to be carefully considered. For instance, 
defaultany consideration should involve a detailed
default analysis of the causes of recent cycling deaths. Any risk involved in cycling needs to be weighed against the health implications of not 
defaultengaging in exercise
default. Consideration also needs to be given of the impact of journeys being taken by car or public transport, if they are not taken by bicycle. For example, this could have a knock on effect 
defaultin terms of air quality and road safety
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultEncoura
defaultging cycling and walking is vital if we are to encourage healthier lifestyles and reduce the strain 
defaulto
defaultn the NHS. It is also vital if we are to avoid 
defaultthe 
defaultgridlock in our towns and cities that could arise if current traffic projections 
default(
default41 per cent increase i
defaultn traffic on local roads by 2040
default)
default 
defaultcome to 
defaultfruition
default&#xa0;
defaultThe appropriate question is can cycling be made safer, and if so, can that be funded
default?
default&#xa0;
defaultQ: What could central and local government do to improve cycling safety?default&#xa0;
defaultPart 6Traffic Management Act 2004: defaultCivil endefaultforcement of traffic contraventionsdefault&#xa0;defaultOne of the quickest and simplest measures the 
defaultG
defaultovernment could take to improve cycling safety would be to implement 
defaultP
defaultart 6 of the Traffic Management Act 2004
default. This would 
defaultallow councils outside London to enforce cycle lanes and to enforce 
defaultagainst 
defaultvarious 
defaultother 
defaulttraffic offences (for example banned turns)
default, which can 
defaultcause
default particular danger to cyclists
default.
default&#xa0;defaultThe chief issue for councils in requesting these powers is traffic manage
defaultment, which would be enhanced by enforcing banned turns and box junctions. There will be no obligation on councils to adopt these powers and there will be a cost in doing so at any particular location. This will encourage councils to adopt the powers only 
defaultwhere they think they will make a difference to congestion and safety, including that of cyclists. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe enforcement of cycle lanes would help promote cycling and increase safety. In 2011 accidents caused by banned turns or wrong direction driving (one per
default cent of all accidents) cost an estimated £83.7m
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe LGA has consistently called for the implementation of 
defaultP
defaultart 6 of the Traffic Management Act 2004 since that 
defaultlegislation
default 
defaultachieved Royal Assent
default 
defaultwas passed. 
defaultThe 2011 report on congestion by the House of 
defaultCommons Transport Select Committee argued that ‘Making the most of the road capacity for all road users requires active management of the road network by the highway authorities and they need the appropriate tools to do that…
default&#xa0;
defaultWe can see no reason why Part 
default6 of the Traffic Management Act 2004 should not be fully commenced to enable local authorities to deal more effectively with moving traffic contraventions and we recommend that the Government bring this part of the Act into force, by 2013’
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Welsh Gov
defaulternment has taken action to implement Part 6 this year and the DfT has been considering submission
defaults
default from the LGA
default,
default and from Nottingham and Sheffield councils
default,
default demonstrating the benefits of the legislation
default, since 
defaultlast December
default. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultRoad Maintenancedefault default&#xa0;
defaultRoad maintenance is also an issue of concern when it comes to safety. Decades of underfunding, severe winters and widespread flooding has left large swathes of our roads in disrepair, with many councils struggling to move beyond simply patching up a deteri
defaultorating network. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCurrent funding for road maintenance is £829m a year short of the level needed to prevent the 98 per cent of roads maintained 
defaultby councils 
defaultfrom
default deteriorating further and even if funding was adequate it would take more than a decade to cle
defaultar the backlog of repairs.
default Increased highways maintenance funding from 2015 will still leave a shortfall of over half a billion pounds a year. 
default&#xa0;
defaultL
defaultocal government does not have the money 
defaultto maintain its highways 
defaultdue to the funding cuts it has endured – 43%
default across this current Parliament. We need a radical new solution to ensure a sustainable and reliable model of local government for the future (see funding section at the end of this submission).
default&#xa0;
defaultTransport Devolutiondefault&#xa0;
defaultCycling is a great example of the need
default for effective transport devolution
default – being both an example of the need to see transport as a whole and of the interaction between transport and other policies.
default&#xa0;
defaultCycling can play a key role in solving transport problems. 
defaultAt its most dramatic, this can mean
default that when
default motorway congestion is caused by short distance commuter traffic, encouraging cycling and public transport use by commuters may prove cheaper and more effective means of reducing that congestion than widening the motorway.
default But cycling can also b
defaulte part of a 
defaulttransport
default strategy on a smaller scale, opening up access to jobs and services in areas where demand is too 
defaultdiffuse
default or sporadic to justi
defaultfy a subsidis
defaulted bus service. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCycling is also a vital part of encouraging healthy 
defaultcommunities.
default Local
default governm
defaultent needs to be able to plan local transport facilities whilst considering other interrelated issues such as health and wellbeing, environment and planning. For example, councils may want to encourage cycling to school and this could influence such diverse
default activities as:
default&#xa0;
defaultTo be effective, the promotion of cycling needs to go hand in hand with effective traffic management and public transport provision to minimi
defaults
defaulte other traffic and ensure it does not deter cyclists. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAt the same time we need to recognize that places are different, the local geography will have some influence on the popularity of cycling and the needs of rural and urban areas will be different. 
defaultCydefaultcling needs to be promoted in a way that is locally relevant.default&#xa0;
defaultIn the absence of effective devolution, the DfT’s National Traffic Model predicts that while cycle use will rise from 2.9
default 
defaultb
defaultillio
defaultn miles in 2010 to 3.4
default 
defaultb
defaultillion
default miles in 2015, it will fall back to almost the 2010 level by 2025 with subsequent growth at such a low level it represents a decline relative to population, assuming that current policy remains unchanged. This suggests that the 
defaultG
defaultovernment will fail to mee
defaultt its existing cycling targets. While this is only a projection based on the continuation of existing policy
default,
default there is a danger that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy with projected low use justifying a decline in funding. Experience in London (where c
defaultar traffic reduced five times as much between 2003 and 2010 as DfT had predicted) shows that where local government has the power and funding to manage traffic effectively and provide alternatives, projected traffic growth does not have to be a self-fulfil
defaultling prophecy.
default&#xa0;defaultCouncils need to be given greater local control over how money is spent, based on place and need
default. This will allow them to take a holistic approach to transport in their area, including all the different elements such as rail, roads, buses
default, cycling etc. This would also help address the problems with transport funding. 
default&#xa0;
defaultLeadership, commitment and capacity in local governmentdefault default&#xa0;
defaultUp and down the country councils have embarked on a huge range of initiatives to support cyclists, such as:
default&#xa0;
defaultThe LGA would be willing to source specific examples should that be of interest to the Committee. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, councils have been maintaining a chronically underfunded road system for many years which, coupled with severe funding cuts from central government
default, means resources for new cycling initiatives or overhauls of road layout and signage are extremely stretched in many areas at the moment.
default&#xa0;
defaultCouncils work with schools and other groups to provide cycling proficiency schemes. However, some councils find the 
defaultrequirements of the top down government init
defaultiatives like Bikeability too pre
defaultscriptive and bureaucratic for their needs, opting instead for local alternatives which better suit their communities.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Local Sustainable Transport Fund has funded a number of 
defaultcycling initiatives. This is being subsumed into the Local Growth Fund from 2015 and it remains to be seen whether 
defaultcycling will continue to receive funding under the new arrangements.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe financial realitydefault&#xa0;
defaultIn the period of the current Parliament, local 
defaultgovernment’s core funding will fall by 43 per cent.  At the same time funding pressures are increasing due to our ageing population pushing up demand for adult social care services such as home care for the elderly and infirm, the number of children in car
defaulte doubling and waste 
defaultmanagement costs rising. LGA analysis shows that these three areas of spending will soak up an ever-larger share of council budgets. Other services – transport, leisure, culture, planning and economic development – will need to accommo
defaultdate the further cuts meaning that spending in these areas will fall by 2019-20
default. There will be a funding gap of £15.6 billion by 2020. LGA analysis modelling the future of local government finance revealed that the financial blackdefault defaulthole facing local governmdefaultent is widening by £2.1 billion per year.default   To give local authorities greater financial stability, the LGA issued a submission to HM Treasury ahead of the Autumn Statement calling for the Government:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWhitehall 
defaultmust consider radical new approaches
default to the way local government is funded and give greater control to councils so that spend can be based on local need.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ: Would it be desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from other road users, including, for defaultexample, by prohibiting HGVs from entering city centres at peak hours?default&#xa0;
defaultThis is a decision that councils should be free to take at a local level. Every area is different, with individual characteristics and circumstances that need to be considered. Central
default government is not in a position to make such local-based decisions.
