defaultCTC, the national cycling charity, was founded in 1878.  CTC has 70,000 
defaultmembers and supporters, provides a range of information and legal services to cyclists, organises cycling events, and represents the interests of cyclists and cycling on issues of public policy.

defaultCTC’s ‘
defaultSafety in numbers
default’
default campaign (
defaultwww.ctc.org..uk/campaign/safety-in-numbers
default) has shown that ‘more’ and ‘safer’ cycling can 
defaultand should
default go hand in hand, as well as calling for the actions needed to ensure that they do.  CTC’s ongoing 
default‘
defaultRoad Justice
default’
default 
defaultcampaign (
defaultwww.roadjustice.org.uk
default) is highlighting the inadequacies of the responses to bad driving from the police, 
defaultprosecutors and the courts, while calling for action to improve these.
default&#xa0;
default3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCTC played a key role 
defaultin shaping the Times newspaper’s 8-point ‘Cities fit for cycling’ manifesto
default, and the subsequent parliamentary ‘Get Britain Cycling’ inquiry and report
default, whose 18 recommendations we 
defaultstrongly 
defaultendorse.  
defaultCTC’s President, the broadcaster Jon Snow, gave evidenc
defaulte both at the Commons Transport Committee’s original inquiry on the Government’s road safety strategy
default, and the ‘Get Britain Cycling’ inquiry
default, emphasising the importance of ‘leadership’ in order to get Britain cycling.
default&#xa0;
default4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn response, the Prime Minister has
default now publicly stated his ambition to launch a “Cycling revolution”.  The Government is now drafting a Cycle Delivery Plan, aimed at fulfilling this ambition.  CTC is represented on the steering group providing high-level input to this Plan, and recently ho
defaultsted 3 days of discussions with Department for Transport (DfT) officials
default to discuss proposals.  We also have regular dialogue with officials from DfT and other departments or governmental bodies, including the Highways Agency.
default&#xa0;
defaultSummarydefault&#xa0;
default5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCycling is essenti
defaultally a safe activity, causing little risk either to cyclists themselves or to other road users.  Its health benefits far outweigh the risks involved, i.e. despite those risks, cycling significantly increases one
default’
defaults average life expectancy.  Moreover, there 
defaultis good evidence that cyclists gain from ‘safety in numbers’, with cycling typically becoming safer as cycle use increases.  In other words, more and safer cycling can, and should, go hand in hand.
default&#xa0;
default6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCycle safety is nonetheless a good deal worse in Britain 
defaultthan in many neighbouring continental 
defaultcountries.  Despite its health and other benefits, people in Britain are deterred from cycling (or from allowing our children to do so) by both the actual and perceived risks involved.
default&#xa0;
default7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo maximise the health, economic
default, environmental and other benefits of more and safer cycling, the focus of action nationally and locally needs to be on removing those actual and perceived risks: unsafe road and junction designs, traffic volumes and speeds, irresponsible driving (and a le
defaultgal system that fails to respond adequately to this), and lorries.
default&#xa0;
default8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCycle training also 
defaultplays
default an important role, not only in giving would-be cyclists of all ages
default 
defaultthe confidence and skills needed to cycle safely and legally, but also 
defaultin improving
default driving st
defaultandards
default 
defaultas part of the driver training process, particularly for drivers of lorries and other large vehicles.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ1: Is cycling safe?default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCycling is not an especially risky activity. On average, 1 
defaultcyclist is killed
default on Britain’s roads for every 26
default m
defaultillion miles travelled by cycle,
default 
defaultequating
default 
defaultroughly to 
default1 cycle fatality for 
defaultevery 10
default00 times cycled round the world.

defaultss likely 
defaultto be injured in an hour of 
defaultcycling

defaultMore
default information on the low risks of cycling are in CTC’s 
default‘R
defaultoad safety
default’
default campaigns briefing
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default10
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBy contrast, the health benefits of cycling are vast.  A person who cycles regularly (but not strenuously) in mid-adulthood 
defaulttypically enjoys a level of fitness equivalent to someone 10 years younger, and has a life expectancy two years above the average. 
default 
defaultIt has been estimated that, thanks to these extra life-years, 
defaultthe 
defaulthealth 
defaultbenefits of cycling 
defaultoutweigh the risks involved by around 20:1, a figure now endorsed by the UK Government.
default  
defaultA population-wide study in Copenhagen found that, compared with those who 
defaultcycled regularly to work, people who did not do so had a 39% higher mortality rate, regardless of whether or not they sometimes took part in other physical activities at other times.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default11
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAlthough cycling is relatively (but
default not exceptionally) risky for the user compared with most
default 
defaultother transport modes, the opposite is true if you consider how little risk cyclists impose on
default 
defaultother people.  In 2012, 98
default% of killed or seriously injured (KSI) pedestrians in urban areas
default 
default(i.e. where
default pedestrians are most likely to be) resulted from collisions with motor vehicles.
default&#xa0;
default12
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA CTC analysis of Department for Transport (DfT) data for 2005-07
default revealed that, per urban
default mile travelled (excluding motorways, where cyclists and pedestrians are prohibited), cars are 2.3 times more likely than cycles to be involved in a pedestrian injury, and 3.2 times as likely 
defaultto be involved in a pedestrian fatality.  The ratios of danger p
defaultresented to pedestrians and
default cyclists by each class of vehicle are displayed 
defaultin the following table
default.
default 
defaultCTC’s ‘Safety in numbers’
default booklet
default 
defaultprovides f
defaulturther information on the low risks of cycling to other road users.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default13
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is also good evidence that increased cycle use can be good for the safety of cyclists themselves –
default i.e., that cyclists gain from ‘
defaultSafety in Numbers
default’
default.  This can be seen both from international comparisons, from 
defaulttrends over time in both Britain and the Netherlands, and from CTC’s own comparison of cycle use and cyclists’ safety in different parts of Britain.

default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn 2011, 61% of people surveyed on their attitudes agreed or strongly agreed that 
default“it is too dangerous for me to cycle on the roads.”
default 
default 
defaultIf we are to successfully deliver both ‘more’ and ‘safer’ cycling, it is vital to tackle the sources of danger and fear which deter people from cycling, and not to exacerbate those fears with misguided ‘safety awareness’ campaigns which overstate the risks
default of cycling.  
defaultWe return to these sources of danger and fear, and ways to overcome them, in answer to Questions 2 and 3.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default15
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn its previous report on the Government’s Road Safety Strategy, the Commons Transport Committee rightly criticised the Strategy’s lack of any targets.  However simplistic casualty reduction targets can be even more problematic than having no targets at al
defaultl. These have in the past created a perverse incentive for road safety officers 
defaultnot
default to encourage cycling, for fear that more cycle use would undermine those targets.
default&#xa0;
default16
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCTC therefore supports the Government’s 
defaultadoption of 
defaultrate-
defaultbased indicators 
defaultto measure cycl
defaulte safety,
default e.
defaultg. measuring cycle
default casualties
default per million km rather t
defaulthan simply the number of cyclist
default casualties
default (
defaultalthough we would have preferred 
defaultrate-based targets)
default.  We now encourage the use of similar rate-based targets or indicators for local road safety 
defaultpolicies 
defaulttoo
default.
default&#xa0;
default17
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCTC nonetheless recognises that many councils, particularly shire counties, lack the cycle use 
defaultdata 
defaultneeded to measure the risk of cycling reliably.  Yet they could easily measure
default 
defaultpublic perceptions of the safety of cycling, either in 
defaultaddition to a ‘risk-based indicator, or as a
default substitute for it while developing their cycle use monitoring capacity.  Perception-based indicators focus attention on the need to overcome perceived as well as actual danger.  Reducing fear can be expected to 
defaultboost cycle use, leading in turn to improvements in
default 
defaultactual cycle safety, via the ‘safety in numbers’ effect.
default&#xa0;
defaultRecommendations
default&#xa0;
defaultCTC proposes the following commitments for Government’s forthcoming Cycling Delivery Plan:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQ2: What could central and local government do to improve cycling safety?default&#xa0;
default18
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIf we are to encourage more as well as safer cycling, the key sources of danger and fear to be tackled are: unsafe roads and 
defaultjunction designs, traffic volumes and speeds, irresponsible driving (and a legal system which fails to respond adequately), and lorries.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default19
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCycle planning contributes 
defaultto wider aims of reducing motor traffic and safer streets.  However
default,
default it also depends on wider measures to achieve those aims.
default&#xa0;
default20
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA report for DfT by University College London found that
default:
default 
default“The key relationship is 
defaultbetween car use and physical 
defaultactivity. In 
defaultorde
defaultr to increa
defaultse levels of physical activity, 
defaultit is necessary to reduce use of the car.”
default  Traffic reduction can be achieved on an area-wide basis (e.g. through various forms of road user or parking charges, or simply by reducing the availability of road or p
defaultarking space), or on a more localised basis through the technique of “filtered permeability” (i.e. allowing pedestrian, cycle
default and/or public transport access.
default&#xa0;
default21
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn terms of safety, a Transport Research Laboratory report found that the most important infrastr
defaultucture-related measure for improving cycle safety was to reduce motor traffic speeds, whether through lower speed limits, 
defaulthigh 
defaultquality street design or by safe junction design (e.g. use of traffic signals, tight corners, providing clear cycle priority)
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default22
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe aim should be to create comprehensive networks of routes for cycling, which are not only safe but also convenient, direct, coherent and attractiv
defaulte, for people of all ages, backgrounds and abilities.  These networks should encompass the whole of the road network, thereby providing access to the full range of destinations people wish to reach. However, they should be supplemented wherever possible wi
defaultth high-quality traffic-free routes, making cycling not only safer but more attractive and convenient than car travel.
default&#xa0;
default23
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBroadly speaking, good cycle routes will 
defaulttend to 
defaultfall into 3 categories:
default&#xa0;
default24
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPhotographs in the appendix illustrate
default a variety of techniques that can be used to create cycle-friendly streets with low traffi
defaultc volumes and speeds, or traffic-free routes.
default&#xa0;
default25
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCTC has strongly advocated the concept of “cycle-proofing”, i.e. ensuring that consistent high standards of cycle-friendly planning and design are incorporated into all highway and traffic schemes.  The same g
defaultoes also for new developments and even for planned road maintenance work.  New York City’s Department of Transport has shown how 
defaulthigh 
defaultquality cycle facilities can be introduced 
defaultvery
default cost-effectively, by installing them in conjunction with a planned resurfa
defaultcing of the carriageway.
default&#xa0;
default26
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government and Highways Agency issue a variety of design guidance on cycle-friendly infrastructure and planning. 
default 
defaultTheir underlying principles are generally sound, but they are contradictory and woolly.  In practice, a lot of r
defaulteally awful designs are adopted, which is often entirely compliant with at least one of the available guidance documents.  Meanwhile engineers and planners, from local authorities and the Highways Agency alike, readily admit they have had little or no trai
defaultning in the principles of cycle-friendly planning and design.  This situation needs to be rectified, if cycle-friendly planning and design is to become the norm
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultRecommendations
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultFor more information
default, see CTC’s campaigns briefing on cycle-friendly planning and design:
default&#xa0;
default27
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government will shortly publish a Green Paper on the 
defaulttraining and testing of young or novice drivers.  CTC fully supports the anticipated proposals to require drivers to have a minimum number of lessons, and to reach the age of 18, before they can obtain a full driving licence. We also support restrictions o
defaultn young drivers carrying young passengers at night, and for ‘graduated’ licensing, whereby novice drivers forfeit their licence after accumulating just 6 points (instead of 12) for a period after passing their test.
default&#xa0;
default28
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever CTC also believes the Green Pap
defaulter is a vital opportunity to incorporate cycle awareness, and indeed some actual cycle training, into the driver training and testing process – and not just for young and novice drivers either.  We believe the minimum of 25 
defaulthours of instruction should incl
defaultude at least 5 hours of cyclist awareness training, preferably consisting of actual cycle training.  This would not only raise drivers’ understanding of how to interact with cyclists, but also encourage them to view cycling as a serious alternative to driv
defaulting beyond the age when they acquire a licence.
default&#xa0;
default29
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe also believe actual cycle training should be a requirement for obtaining a bus or goods vehicle driving licence, and that cycle training should be a compulsory part of the drivers’ Certificate of Professi
defaultonal Competence (CPC) process.  A growing number of local authorities are requiring their fleet drivers (e.g. those driving refuse vehicles) to undertake cycle training, with drivers themselves reporting positively on the experience.
default&#xa0;
default30
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPublic cycle safety a
defaultwareness campaigns should focus on the importance of looking for cyclists at junctions, and leaving space for cyclists when overtaking.  Drivers need to know that cyclists are trained to avoid being too close to the kerb, or to parked cars, for their own s
defaultafety (e.g. so they do not have to swerve outwards to avoid potholes).
default&#xa0;
defaultRecommendations
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default31
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCTC supports responsible behaviour by all road users. We do not defend irresponsible cycling, any more than the AA or RAC defend irresponsible driving.  Moreover we strongly support increased resources for road traffic policing – see next secti
defaulton.
default&#xa0;
default32
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever it is important not to overstate the role of irresponsible cycling in serious or fatal collisions.  Police data suggest that, in collisions between a cyclist and a motor vehicle, the police are about 3 times more likely to attribute responsibi
defaultlity solely to the driver than to the cyclist.  A Transport for London analysis o
defaultf serious or fatal cyclists’ in
defaultjuries in London suggest that around 5% involve disobedience of junction controls by cyclists, whereas 15% involve disobedience by drivers.
default&#xa0;
default33
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCy
defaultcle training can nonetheless play a valuable role, not only in giving people the confidence and skills to cycle more often, but also in encouraging responsible attitudes and behaviour.  It can raise awareness particularly among younger cyclists of the inti
defaultmidation (as well as the actual risks) that they can pose to pedestrians who are frail or who suffer mobility or sensory impairments.  CTC fully recognises that they too want to be able to get around without fear (as well as without danger), 
defaultjust as cyclis
defaultts themselves do.

default&#xa0;
default34
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultToo often, when drivers have killed or seriously injured other road users, the legal system’s response is woefully inadequate. Poor police investigations and/or weak prosecution decisions often result in derisory 
defaultsentences, or cases being dropped altogether.  This not only encapsulates society’s complacent attitudes to other people’s safety on the roads, but also perpetuates it – with pedestrians and cyclists being disproportionately the victims.

defaultCTC’s 
default‘

default campaign (
defaultwww.roadjustice.org.uk

default.
default&#xa0;
default36
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCTC’s ‘
defaultRoad Justice
default’
default campaign has already published a booklet on the failings of road 
defaultpolicing
default (downloadable from the website above)
default. It includes harrowing personal stories of
default apparent police failings; data to show that these are not one-off failings; and a 10-point 
defaultcharter for improving roads policing.  S
defaulteveral police forces or Police and
default Crime 
defaultCo
defaultmmissioners have signed up to the charter’s recommendations, either in full or in part.
default&#xa0;
default37
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPrompted by the launch of CTC’s 
default‘
defaultRoad Justice
default’
default campaign, the Government has set up a cross
default-
defaultorganisational justice review group, bringing together the Department for 
defaultTransport (DfT), Home
default Office, Ministry of Justice (MoJ), police, Crown Prosecution Service and Sentencing Council, to address the legal system’s multiple failings.  The Sentencing Council has undertaken to review its sentencing guidelines for serious bad d
defaultriving offences, and the Crown Prosecution Service has indicated it is minded to follow suit with the corresponding prosecuting guidelines.  CTC believes it is vital to integrate these two processes.  The aim should be to 
defaultstop dismissing driving which has 
defaultcaused what is obviously 
defaultserious danger as merely being ‘
defaultcarelessness
default’
default (this, we believe, is wrong in law), but at the same time to make greater use of driving bans (rather than prison sentences) for 
default‘
defaultdangerous
default’
default offences which involve a driver who is not c
defaultonsidered so dangerous as to need to be locked up for the public’s protection.
default&#xa0;
default38
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCTC has highlighted the lack 
defaultof integration of the police’s ‘
defaultSTATS 19
default’
default data (which describes the circumstances of road collisions (including among other things the types of roa
defaultd-users involved in collisions, and who suffered injuries of what severities) and the
default justice system data, which shows how many prosecutions and convictions there were for 
defaultdifferent driving offences, and the resulting sentences.  The lack of such a linkage
default means the Government cannot say (for instance) how many injuries or fatalities to cyclists
default (or any other road user type) led to drivers (or particular types of driver, e.g. lorry drivers) being prosecuted or convicted, or for what driving offences, or wha
defaultt sentences they received.
default&#xa0;
default39
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAt CTC’s prompting, DfT and MoJ are now committed to investigate options for improving both
default the data on and accountability of how the legal system responds to bad driving, both locally 
defaultand nationally.  However, individual road c
defaultrash victims and bereaved families also need better
default access to information about who is making what decisions about 
defaultthe handling of their cases
default.  At present, the victims of non-fatal injuries have no rights under
default the Victims’ Charter if the police believe the driving was merely ‘careless’ (rather than ‘dangerous’). This deprives them of rights to information, making it very hard for them to challenge 
defaultthe 
defaultpolice 
defaultor
default prosecutors when (as often happens) they feel 
defaultthat
default legally incorrect decisions are being made
default.

default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs the table on p3
default shows, lorries have a relatively low 
defaultinvolvement 
defaultrate in cyclists’ injuries, but 
defaulta very high involvement rate in cyclists’ fatalities – 
defaulti.e.
default a collision with a lorry is disproportionately
default likely to prove lethal.  Lorries cover only 5% of vehicle mileage in Britain, yet they account for around 20% of cy
defaultclists’ fatalities (and around 
default15% of pedestrian fatalities), rising to over 50% of cyclist fatalities in London.  Their 
defaultinvolvement 
defaultrate in cycle fatalities is far higher than 
defaultthat of 
defaultbuses.  The difference is likely to be that lorry drivers sit high up and are surrounded by metal, whe
defaultreas bus drivers are much lower, and are able to see cyclists both in front and to the side of them thanks to a much larger area of window.  Most lorry-cyclist fatalities involve a left-turning lorry, with the cyclist generally being hit by the front (typi
defaultcally the front corner) of the lorry, rather than by the side.
default&#xa0;
default41
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThese facts in turn indicate that those (such as the Mayor of London) who attempt to point
default fingers either at cyclists or at lorry drivers are wide of the mark.  
defaultCTC’s 
default‘
defaultRoad Justice
default’
default campaign 
defaulthas recorded 
defaultseveral
default cases lorry drivers 
defaultbeing
default convicted for caus
defaulting deaths and serious injuries
default e.g. 
defaultthe driver who left 
defaultTimes journalist Mary Bowers in a near-coma was 
defaultusing his 
defaultmobile 
defaultphone beforehand
default.  However a far more important point is that the 
defaultlorry itself is an inherently dangerous machine, whose design is simply not appropriate for urban streets.
default&#xa0;
default42
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAccording to t
defaulthe principles of risk management
default,
default the primary aim should be to eliminate or reduce risk – training people to avoid risks should only b
defaulte deployed once the source of risk 
defaulthas been eliminated as far as possible.  Aside from improved cycling infrastructure (
defaultnotably
default on main roads and junctions)
default, the 
defaultmost appropriate 
defaultsolutions are 
defaulttherefore: 
default(a) to redesign lorry cabs 
defaultto improve drivers’ visib
defaultility of pedestrians and cyclists;
default and (b) 
defaultsimply to reduce
default the numbers of lorries on busy streets at busy times.
default&#xa0;
default43
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAlthough these are the ‘big wins’, it must be admitted that neither of them are ‘quick wins’.
default  Progress can be made meanwhile (a) by making i
defaultt standard to fit cameras and sensors onto all lorries operating on urban streets, (b) by providing actual cycle training (not just cycle awareness training) for lorry drivers – see paragraph 
default33
default, and (c) by raising cyclist awareness of the risks of overtaking lorries on the left hand side, e.g. through stickers on the rear of lorries, thro
defaultugh cycle training and through ‘
defaultExchanging Places
default’
default events (where cyclists get to sit in lorry cabs to see
default the extent of the driver’s ‘
defaultblind spot
default’
default).

defaultQ3. Is it desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from other road users?default&#xa0;
default44
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs noted in paragraph 
default27
default, CTC’s preference for cycle provision on main roads is for some form of physical segregation, but with the caveat that this has to be done without creating conflict with pedestrians, or under
defaultmining cyclists’ priority and safety at junctions.  75% of cyclists’ collisions occur at or near junctions
default, so their safety at these conflict points is 
defaultof key importance
default.  If done badly, segregation can exacerbate these conflicts, rather than resolving th
defaultem.  Unfortunately, segregation in the UK is normally done to very poor standards.  This 
defaultneeds to change. The appendix overleaf highlights some of the problems and their solutions.
