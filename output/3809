[normal]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]CTC, the national cycling charity, was founded in 1878.  CTC has 70,000 
[normal]members and supporters, provides a range of information and legal services to cyclists, organises cycling events, and represents the interests of cyclists and cycling on issues of public policy.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]CTC’s ‘
[normal]Safety in numbers
[normal]’
[normal] campaign (
[normal]www.ctc.org..uk/campaign/safety-in-numbers
[normal]) has shown that ‘more’ and ‘safer’ cycling can 
[normal]and should
[normal] go hand in hand, as well as calling for the actions needed to ensure that they do.  CTC’s ongoing 
[normal]‘
[normal]Road Justice
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]campaign (
[normal]www.roadjustice.org.uk
[normal]) is highlighting the inadequacies of the responses to bad driving from the police, 
[normal]prosecutors and the courts, while calling for action to improve these.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]CTC played a key role 
[normal]in shaping the Times newspaper’s 8-point ‘Cities fit for cycling’ manifesto
[normal], and the subsequent parliamentary ‘Get Britain Cycling’ inquiry and report
[normal], whose 18 recommendations we 
[normal]strongly 
[normal]endorse.  
[normal]CTC’s President, the broadcaster Jon Snow, gave evidenc
[normal]e both at the Commons Transport Committee’s original inquiry on the Government’s road safety strategy
[normal], and the ‘Get Britain Cycling’ inquiry
[normal], emphasising the importance of ‘leadership’ in order to get Britain cycling.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In response, the Prime Minister has
[normal] now publicly stated his ambition to launch a “Cycling revolution”.  The Government is now drafting a Cycle Delivery Plan, aimed at fulfilling this ambition.  CTC is represented on the steering group providing high-level input to this Plan, and recently ho
[normal]sted 3 days of discussions with Department for Transport (DfT) officials
[normal] to discuss proposals.  We also have regular dialogue with officials from DfT and other departments or governmental bodies, including the Highways Agency.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Summary[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Cycling is essenti
[normal]ally a safe activity, causing little risk either to cyclists themselves or to other road users.  Its health benefits far outweigh the risks involved, i.e. despite those risks, cycling significantly increases one
[normal]’
[normal]s average life expectancy.  Moreover, there 
[normal]is good evidence that cyclists gain from ‘safety in numbers’, with cycling typically becoming safer as cycle use increases.  In other words, more and safer cycling can, and should, go hand in hand.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Cycle safety is nonetheless a good deal worse in Britain 
[normal]than in many neighbouring continental 
[normal]countries.  Despite its health and other benefits, people in Britain are deterred from cycling (or from allowing our children to do so) by both the actual and perceived risks involved.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To maximise the health, economic
[normal], environmental and other benefits of more and safer cycling, the focus of action nationally and locally needs to be on removing those actual and perceived risks: unsafe road and junction designs, traffic volumes and speeds, irresponsible driving (and a le
[normal]gal system that fails to respond adequately to this), and lorries.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Cycle training also 
[normal]plays
[normal] an important role, not only in giving would-be cyclists of all ages
[normal] 
[normal]the confidence and skills needed to cycle safely and legally, but also 
[normal]in improving
[normal] driving st
[normal]andards
[normal] 
[normal]as part of the driver training process, particularly for drivers of lorries and other large vehicles.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q1: Is cycling safe?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Cycling is not an especially risky activity. On average, 1 
[normal]cyclist is killed
[normal] on Britain’s roads for every 26
[normal] m
[normal]illion miles travelled by cycle,
[normal] 
[normal]equating
[normal] 
[normal]roughly to 
[normal]1 cycle fatality for 
[normal]every 10
[normal]00 times cycled round the world.
[normal] You are 
[normal]about as
[normal] 
[normal]un
[normal]likely to be killed in a mile of cycling 
[normal]as 
[normal]a mile of walking
[normal], and 
[normal]le
[normal]ss likely 
[normal]to be injured in an hour of 
[normal]cycling
[normal] than an hour of 
[normal]gardening
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]More
[normal] information on the low risks of cycling are in CTC’s 
[normal]‘R
[normal]oad safety
[normal]’
[normal] campaigns briefing
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]By contrast, the health benefits of cycling are vast.  A person who cycles regularly (but not strenuously) in mid-adulthood 
[normal]typically enjoys a level of fitness equivalent to someone 10 years younger, and has a life expectancy two years above the average. 
[normal] 
[normal]It has been estimated that, thanks to these extra life-years, 
[normal]the 
[normal]health 
[normal]benefits of cycling 
[normal]outweigh the risks involved by around 20:1, a figure now endorsed by the UK Government.
[normal]  
[normal]A population-wide study in Copenhagen found that, compared with those who 
[normal]cycled regularly to work, people who did not do so had a 39% higher mortality rate, regardless of whether or not they sometimes took part in other physical activities at other times.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Although cycling is relatively (but
[normal] not exceptionally) risky for the user compared with most
[normal] 
[normal]other transport modes, the opposite is true if you consider how little risk cyclists impose on
[normal] 
[normal]other people.  In 2012, 98
[normal]% of killed or seriously injured (KSI) pedestrians in urban areas
[normal] 
[normal](i.e. where
[normal] pedestrians are most likely to be) resulted from collisions with motor vehicles.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A CTC analysis of Department for Transport (DfT) data for 2005-07
[normal] revealed that, per urban
[normal] mile travelled (excluding motorways, where cyclists and pedestrians are prohibited), cars are 2.3 times more likely than cycles to be involved in a pedestrian injury, and 3.2 times as likely 
[normal]to be involved in a pedestrian fatality.  The ratios of danger p
[normal]resented to pedestrians and
[normal] cyclists by each class of vehicle are displayed 
[normal]in the following table
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]CTC’s ‘Safety in numbers’
[normal] booklet
[normal] 
[normal]provides f
[normal]urther information on the low risks of cycling to other road users.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is also good evidence that increased cycle use can be good for the safety of cyclists themselves –
[normal] i.e., that cyclists gain from ‘
[normal]Safety in Numbers
[normal]’
[normal].  This can be seen both from international comparisons, from 
[normal]trends over time in both Britain and the Netherlands, and from CTC’s own comparison of cycle use and cyclists’ safety in different parts of Britain.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In 2011, 61% of people surveyed on their attitudes agreed or strongly agreed that 
[normal]“it is too dangerous for me to cycle on the roads.”
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]If we are to successfully deliver both ‘more’ and ‘safer’ cycling, it is vital to tackle the sources of danger and fear which deter people from cycling, and not to exacerbate those fears with misguided ‘safety awareness’ campaigns which overstate the risks
[normal] of cycling.  
[normal]We return to these sources of danger and fear, and ways to overcome them, in answer to Questions 2 and 3.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In its previous report on the Government’s Road Safety Strategy, the Commons Transport Committee rightly criticised the Strategy’s lack of any targets.  However simplistic casualty reduction targets can be even more problematic than having no targets at al
[normal]l. These have in the past created a perverse incentive for road safety officers 
[normal]not
[normal] to encourage cycling, for fear that more cycle use would undermine those targets.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]CTC therefore supports the Government’s 
[normal]adoption of 
[normal]rate-
[normal]based indicators 
[normal]to measure cycl
[normal]e safety,
[normal] e.
[normal]g. measuring cycle
[normal] casualties
[normal] per million km rather t
[normal]han simply the number of cyclist
[normal] casualties
[normal] (
[normal]although we would have preferred 
[normal]rate-based targets)
[normal].  We now encourage the use of similar rate-based targets or indicators for local road safety 
[normal]policies 
[normal]too
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]CTC nonetheless recognises that many councils, particularly shire counties, lack the cycle use 
[normal]data 
[normal]needed to measure the risk of cycling reliably.  Yet they could easily measure
[normal] 
[normal]public perceptions of the safety of cycling, either in 
[normal]addition to a ‘risk-based indicator, or as a
[normal] substitute for it while developing their cycle use monitoring capacity.  Perception-based indicators focus attention on the need to overcome perceived as well as actual danger.  Reducing fear can be expected to 
[normal]boost cycle use, leading in turn to improvements in
[normal] 
[normal]actual cycle safety, via the ‘safety in numbers’ effect.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Recommendations
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]CTC proposes the following commitments for Government’s forthcoming Cycling Delivery Plan:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q2: What could central and local government do to improve cycling safety?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]18
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]If we are to encourage more as well as safer cycling, the key sources of danger and fear to be tackled are: unsafe roads and 
[normal]junction designs, traffic volumes and speeds, irresponsible driving (and a legal system which fails to respond adequately), and lorries.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]19
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Cycle planning contributes 
[normal]to wider aims of reducing motor traffic and safer streets.  However
[normal],
[normal] it also depends on wider measures to achieve those aims.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A report for DfT by University College London found that
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]“The key relationship is 
[normal]between car use and physical 
[normal]activity. In 
[normal]orde
[normal]r to increa
[normal]se levels of physical activity, 
[normal]it is necessary to reduce use of the car.”
[normal]  Traffic reduction can be achieved on an area-wide basis (e.g. through various forms of road user or parking charges, or simply by reducing the availability of road or p
[normal]arking space), or on a more localised basis through the technique of “filtered permeability” (i.e. allowing pedestrian, cycle
[normal] and/or public transport access.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]21
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In terms of safety, a Transport Research Laboratory report found that the most important infrastr
[normal]ucture-related measure for improving cycle safety was to reduce motor traffic speeds, whether through lower speed limits, 
[normal]high 
[normal]quality street design or by safe junction design (e.g. use of traffic signals, tight corners, providing clear cycle priority)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]22
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The aim should be to create comprehensive networks of routes for cycling, which are not only safe but also convenient, direct, coherent and attractiv
[normal]e, for people of all ages, backgrounds and abilities.  These networks should encompass the whole of the road network, thereby providing access to the full range of destinations people wish to reach. However, they should be supplemented wherever possible wi
[normal]th high-quality traffic-free routes, making cycling not only safer but more attractive and convenient than car travel.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]23
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Broadly speaking, good cycle routes will 
[normal]tend to 
[normal]fall into 3 categories:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]24
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Photographs in the appendix illustrate
[normal] a variety of techniques that can be used to create cycle-friendly streets with low traffi
[normal]c volumes and speeds, or traffic-free routes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]25
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]CTC has strongly advocated the concept of “cycle-proofing”, i.e. ensuring that consistent high standards of cycle-friendly planning and design are incorporated into all highway and traffic schemes.  The same g
[normal]oes also for new developments and even for planned road maintenance work.  New York City’s Department of Transport has shown how 
[normal]high 
[normal]quality cycle facilities can be introduced 
[normal]very
[normal] cost-effectively, by installing them in conjunction with a planned resurfa
[normal]cing of the carriageway.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]26
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Government and Highways Agency issue a variety of design guidance on cycle-friendly infrastructure and planning. 
[normal] 
[normal]Their underlying principles are generally sound, but they are contradictory and woolly.  In practice, a lot of r
[normal]eally awful designs are adopted, which is often entirely compliant with at least one of the available guidance documents.  Meanwhile engineers and planners, from local authorities and the Highways Agency alike, readily admit they have had little or no trai
[normal]ning in the principles of cycle-friendly planning and design.  This situation needs to be rectified, if cycle-friendly planning and design is to become the norm
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Recommendations
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]For more information
[normal], see CTC’s campaigns briefing on cycle-friendly planning and design:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]27
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Government will shortly publish a Green Paper on the 
[normal]training and testing of young or novice drivers.  CTC fully supports the anticipated proposals to require drivers to have a minimum number of lessons, and to reach the age of 18, before they can obtain a full driving licence. We also support restrictions o
[normal]n young drivers carrying young passengers at night, and for ‘graduated’ licensing, whereby novice drivers forfeit their licence after accumulating just 6 points (instead of 12) for a period after passing their test.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]28
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However CTC also believes the Green Pap
[normal]er is a vital opportunity to incorporate cycle awareness, and indeed some actual cycle training, into the driver training and testing process – and not just for young and novice drivers either.  We believe the minimum of 25 
[normal]hours of instruction should incl
[normal]ude at least 5 hours of cyclist awareness training, preferably consisting of actual cycle training.  This would not only raise drivers’ understanding of how to interact with cyclists, but also encourage them to view cycling as a serious alternative to driv
[normal]ing beyond the age when they acquire a licence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]29
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We also believe actual cycle training should be a requirement for obtaining a bus or goods vehicle driving licence, and that cycle training should be a compulsory part of the drivers’ Certificate of Professi
[normal]onal Competence (CPC) process.  A growing number of local authorities are requiring their fleet drivers (e.g. those driving refuse vehicles) to undertake cycle training, with drivers themselves reporting positively on the experience.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]30
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Public cycle safety a
[normal]wareness campaigns should focus on the importance of looking for cyclists at junctions, and leaving space for cyclists when overtaking.  Drivers need to know that cyclists are trained to avoid being too close to the kerb, or to parked cars, for their own s
[normal]afety (e.g. so they do not have to swerve outwards to avoid potholes).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Recommendations
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]31
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]CTC supports responsible behaviour by all road users. We do not defend irresponsible cycling, any more than the AA or RAC defend irresponsible driving.  Moreover we strongly support increased resources for road traffic policing – see next secti
[normal]on.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]32
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However it is important not to overstate the role of irresponsible cycling in serious or fatal collisions.  Police data suggest that, in collisions between a cyclist and a motor vehicle, the police are about 3 times more likely to attribute responsibi
[normal]lity solely to the driver than to the cyclist.  A Transport for London analysis o
[normal]f serious or fatal cyclists’ in
[normal]juries in London suggest that around 5% involve disobedience of junction controls by cyclists, whereas 15% involve disobedience by drivers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]33
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Cy
[normal]cle training can nonetheless play a valuable role, not only in giving people the confidence and skills to cycle more often, but also in encouraging responsible attitudes and behaviour.  It can raise awareness particularly among younger cyclists of the inti
[normal]midation (as well as the actual risks) that they can pose to pedestrians who are frail or who suffer mobility or sensory impairments.  CTC fully recognises that they too want to be able to get around without fear (as well as without danger), 
[normal]just as cyclis
[normal]ts themselves do.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]34
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Too often, when drivers have killed or seriously injured other road users, the legal system’s response is woefully inadequate. Poor police investigations and/or weak prosecution decisions often result in derisory 
[normal]sentences, or cases being dropped altogether.  This not only encapsulates society’s complacent attitudes to other people’s safety on the roads, but also perpetuates it – with pedestrians and cyclists being disproportionately the victims.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]CTC’s ‘
[normal]Road Justice
[normal]’
[normal] campaign has already published a booklet on the failings of road 
[normal]policing
[normal] (downloadable from the website above)
[normal]. It includes harrowing personal stories of
[normal] apparent police failings; data to show that these are not one-off failings; and a 10-point 
[normal]charter for improving roads policing.  S
[normal]everal police forces or Police and
[normal] Crime 
[normal]Co
[normal]mmissioners have signed up to the charter’s recommendations, either in full or in part.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]37
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Prompted by the launch of CTC’s 
[normal]‘
[normal]Road Justice
[normal]’
[normal] campaign, the Government has set up a cross
[normal]-
[normal]organisational justice review group, bringing together the Department for 
[normal]Transport (DfT), Home
[normal] Office, Ministry of Justice (MoJ), police, Crown Prosecution Service and Sentencing Council, to address the legal system’s multiple failings.  The Sentencing Council has undertaken to review its sentencing guidelines for serious bad d
[normal]riving offences, and the Crown Prosecution Service has indicated it is minded to follow suit with the corresponding prosecuting guidelines.  CTC believes it is vital to integrate these two processes.  The aim should be to 
[normal]stop dismissing driving which has 
[normal]caused what is obviously 
[normal]serious danger as merely being ‘
[normal]carelessness
[normal]’
[normal] (this, we believe, is wrong in law), but at the same time to make greater use of driving bans (rather than prison sentences) for 
[normal]‘
[normal]dangerous
[normal]’
[normal] offences which involve a driver who is not c
[normal]onsidered so dangerous as to need to be locked up for the public’s protection.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]38
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]CTC has highlighted the lack 
[normal]of integration of the police’s ‘
[normal]STATS 19
[normal]’
[normal] data (which describes the circumstances of road collisions (including among other things the types of roa
[normal]d-users involved in collisions, and who suffered injuries of what severities) and the
[normal] justice system data, which shows how many prosecutions and convictions there were for 
[normal]different driving offences, and the resulting sentences.  The lack of such a linkage
[normal] means the Government cannot say (for instance) how many injuries or fatalities to cyclists
[normal] (or any other road user type) led to drivers (or particular types of driver, e.g. lorry drivers) being prosecuted or convicted, or for what driving offences, or wha
[normal]t sentences they received.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]39
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]At CTC’s prompting, DfT and MoJ are now committed to investigate options for improving both
[normal] the data on and accountability of how the legal system responds to bad driving, both locally 
[normal]and nationally.  However, individual road c
[normal]rash victims and bereaved families also need better
[normal] access to information about who is making what decisions about 
[normal]the handling of their cases
[normal].  At present, the victims of non-fatal injuries have no rights under
[normal] the Victims’ Charter if the police believe the driving was merely ‘careless’ (rather than ‘dangerous’). This deprives them of rights to information, making it very hard for them to challenge 
[normal]the 
[normal]police 
[normal]or
[normal] prosecutors when (as often happens) they feel 
[normal]that
[normal] legally incorrect decisions are being made
[normal].

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As the table on p3
[normal] shows, lorries have a relatively low 
[normal]involvement 
[normal]rate in cyclists’ injuries, but 
[normal]a very high involvement rate in cyclists’ fatalities – 
[normal]i.e.
[normal] a collision with a lorry is disproportionately
[normal] likely to prove lethal.  Lorries cover only 5% of vehicle mileage in Britain, yet they account for around 20% of cy
[normal]clists’ fatalities (and around 
[normal]15% of pedestrian fatalities), rising to over 50% of cyclist fatalities in London.  Their 
[normal]involvement 
[normal]rate in cycle fatalities is far higher than 
[normal]that of 
[normal]buses.  The difference is likely to be that lorry drivers sit high up and are surrounded by metal, whe
[normal]reas bus drivers are much lower, and are able to see cyclists both in front and to the side of them thanks to a much larger area of window.  Most lorry-cyclist fatalities involve a left-turning lorry, with the cyclist generally being hit by the front (typi
[normal]cally the front corner) of the lorry, rather than by the side.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]41
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]These facts in turn indicate that those (such as the Mayor of London) who attempt to point
[normal] fingers either at cyclists or at lorry drivers are wide of the mark.  
[normal]CTC’s 
[normal]‘
[normal]Road Justice
[normal]’
[normal] campaign 
[normal]has recorded 
[normal]several
[normal] cases lorry drivers 
[normal]being
[normal] convicted for caus
[normal]ing deaths and serious injuries
[normal] e.g. 
[normal]the driver who left 
[normal]Times journalist Mary Bowers in a near-coma was 
[normal]using his 
[normal]mobile 
[normal]phone beforehand
[normal].  However a far more important point is that the 
[normal]lorry itself is an inherently dangerous machine, whose design is simply not appropriate for urban streets.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]42
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]According to t
[normal]he principles of risk management
[normal],
[normal] the primary aim should be to eliminate or reduce risk – training people to avoid risks should only b
[normal]e deployed once the source of risk 
[normal]has been eliminated as far as possible.  Aside from improved cycling infrastructure (
[normal]notably
[normal] on main roads and junctions)
[normal], the 
[normal]most appropriate 
[normal]solutions are 
[normal]therefore: 
[normal](a) to redesign lorry cabs 
[normal]to improve drivers’ visib
[normal]ility of pedestrians and cyclists;
[normal] and (b) 
[normal]simply to reduce
[normal] the numbers of lorries on busy streets at busy times.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]43
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Although these are the ‘big wins’, it must be admitted that neither of them are ‘quick wins’.
[normal]  Progress can be made meanwhile (a) by making i
[normal]t standard to fit cameras and sensors onto all lorries operating on urban streets, (b) by providing actual cycle training (not just cycle awareness training) for lorry drivers – see paragraph 
[normal]33
[normal], and (c) by raising cyclist awareness of the risks of overtaking lorries on the left hand side, e.g. through stickers on the rear of lorries, thro
[normal]ugh cycle training and through ‘
[normal]Exchanging Places
[normal]’
[normal] events (where cyclists get to sit in lorry cabs to see
[normal] the extent of the driver’s ‘
[normal]blind spot
[normal]’
[normal]).

[normal]Q3. Is it desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from other road users?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]44
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As noted in paragraph 
[normal]27
[normal], CTC’s preference for cycle provision on main roads is for some form of physical segregation, but with the caveat that this has to be done without creating conflict with pedestrians, or under
[normal]mining cyclists’ priority and safety at junctions.  75% of cyclists’ collisions occur at or near junctions
[normal], so their safety at these conflict points is 
[normal]of key importance
[normal].  If done badly, segregation can exacerbate these conflicts, rather than resolving th
[normal]em.  Unfortunately, segregation in the UK is normally done to very poor standards.  This 
[normal]needs to change. The appendix overleaf highlights some of the problems and their solutions.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In most EU countries, drivers making any turning movement at a junction (including at traffic lights
[normal] where they have a green light) are required to stop and give way to both pedestrians and 
[normal]cyclists 
[normal]alongside them who ar
[normal]e going straight ahead.  Without this rule, cyclists using segregated tracks in
[normal] the UK are 
[normal]typically at greater risk of being cut 
[normal]up by left-turning vehicles than they would be 
[normal]if 
[normal]they avoided
[normal] using the cycle 
[normal]tracks
[normal] altogether.  The difference i
[normal]s

[normal]The Department for Transport
[normal] is planning an update to its ‘
[normal]Traffic Signs 
[normal]Regulations and General 
[normal]Directions
[normal]’
[normal] in 2015, with consultation taking place in 2014.  However, many of the councils who 
[normal]have received the Government’s ‘
[normal]Cycle City Ambition
[normal]’
[normal] and cycle safety grant funding wish to start piloting these innovations, 
[normal]before 
[normal]their funding runs out in 2
