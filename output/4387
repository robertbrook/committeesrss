default1.1 The links
default between disability, poverty, and exclusion are irrefutable. 
defaultPeople
default with disabilities form a significant proportion of those most affected by 
defaultemergencies
default.  As such, disability inclusion 
defaultmust be addressed as a core
default issue.  Inclusive programming 
defaulthas been shown to be achievable through
default active participation by 
defaultpeople
default with disabilit
defaulties
default in all aspects of development and 
defaultthrough 
defaultthe provision of specific inputs that empower and provide opportunities for 
defaultpeople
default with disabilities.  
default&#xa0;
default1.2 
defaultSince 1982, Handicap International has sought to 
defaultmainstream disability, with the support of specialist services, rather than build hermetically separate approaches. Nevertheless, actions specifically targeting people with disabilities 
defaultremain essential to reach inclusion objectives.
default  A
defaults one of the only NGOs with a dual focus on humanitarian and development actions and inclusion of people with disabilities in such settings, Handicap International seeks to highlight the importance of inclusion in all aspects of humanitarian work 
default(particularly
default access to relief services and specific programming)
default and 
defaultin longer
default 
defaultterm development work such as education, supporting the reduction of armed violence, and improving equitable access to health services, including rehabilitation. 
default&#xa0;
default1.3 
defaultA cross-cutting theme through all these areas is value for money (
defaultVfM
default). The contribution of 
defaultVfM
default analysis and monitoring in development and humanitarian practice is appreciable. However, there is a risk 
defaultthat
default negative effects on disability and inclusive programming can arise if the 
defaultVfM
default approach relies too heavily on economic considerations 
default(
defaultleading to narrow, reductive view
defaults
default of programme efficacy) at the price of attention on equity, impartiality
default,
default and 
defaultother
default 
defaultqualitative measures.
default&#xa0;
default1.4 
defaultHandicap International recognises and commends the positive steps 
defaultDFID has t
defaultaken to improve disability inclusion in its policies and work. 
default 
defaultHowever, our experience demonstrates that further steps 
defaultare necessary before this
default become systematic. For example, while DFID’s Rwanda education approach (where one pillar focuse
defaults
default on inclusive education) is an excellent example of DFID’s commitment to disability inclusion, the opposite is true in countries like DRC where the DFID country team admitted 
defaultoverlooking
default disability when developing its health strategy.
default&#xa0;
default1.5 
defaultIn ratifying the 
defaultConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)
default, the 
defaultUK committed to 
defaultensuring that UK aid is inclusive of and accessible to people with disabilities, but
default there is still much to be done before programming e
defaultqually benefits all people
default.  The development of policy and programming 
defaultinvolving people
default with disability is vital to a participatory and proactive model of inclusion.  
defaultAs such 
defaultHandicap International calls on DFID to implement a strategic approach to disability inclusion
default through:
default

default2. Humanitarian Response 
default 
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.1 With 
defaultapproximately 
default80% of the world’s disabled population living in developing countries
default, 
defaultHandicap International calls for 
defaultan inclusive approach to emergency response and development initiatives in line with international obligationsdefault.  
defaultThe exclusion of people with disabilities from humanitarian assistance is a fundamental breach of the principle of impartiality and a violation of human rights.default  
defaultIn emergencies, people with disabilities face additional barriers and vulnerabilities linked with their condition and the disruption of their environm
defaultent which pu
defaultt
default them at increased
default risk. 
defaultThe 
defaultCRPD
default outlines that States Parties, including the UK as a 2009 signatory, are obliged to 
defaulttake all appropriate 
defaultadditional measures to secure the safety of persons with disabilities
default (Article 11)
default 
default.  
default&#xa0;
default2
default.2 People with disabilities and older people are disproportionately affected by disasters, yet 
defaultless than
default 
default1% of international humanitarian aid is dedicated to people with disabilitiesdefault.  
defaultA
default 2011 study of submissions to the Consolidated Appeals Process found that only 1.6% of projects included targeted activities for people with disability and
default only
default 0.7% were funded
default. 
defaultData from the current Syrian crisis highlights that approximately 18% of refugees in Jordan and Lebanon live with at least one impairment, be it physical, visual, auditory, or intellectual
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.3 
defaultDisaggregated data on defaultpeopledefault with disability, injury, and chronic illness are insufficiently gathered and shared to inform response.default  DFID has identified 
defaultHandicap International, with 
defaultHelpAge
default, as the
default 
defaultinclusion focal point
default among Rapid Response Facility partners for the Philippines response.  This is a welcome step, but to effect real change this focus by DFID on inclusion must be systematically applied in all crisis contexts and with all implementing partners to avoid substantive information gaps and programming exclusion.
default&#xa0;
default2.4 I
defaultn emergenc
defaulties
default, 
defaultpeopledefault with disabilitiesdefault (and other vulnerable groups) are rarely consulted about their needs
default and 
defaultface significant difficulties accessing humanitarian goods and servicesdefault.  defaultWhen they do, 
defaultgoods and services are often inappropriate.  
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.5 
defaultA recent global study shows that only
default 20% of 
defaultpeople
default with disability could evacuate immediately 
defaultand 
defaultwithout difficulty 
defaultduring
default a sudden disaster, the remainder only with a degree of difficulty
default;
default 6% would 
defaultbe
default 
defaultun
defaultable to do so at all.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, with
default sufficient time, preparation,
default and warning, those able to evacuate without difficulty rises from 20 to 38%
default, underscoring the importance of 
defaultdeveloping and implementing inclusive early warning systems that can reach all defaultpeople defaultthrough adapted messages and communication toolsdefault.
default&#xa0;
default2.
default6
default 
defaultOldefaultder women and women and girls with disabilities experience heightened risk of sexualdefault, physical, and domestic violence, especially during emergencies and conflictdefault.  defaultAs DFID takes forward its
default’
default Call to Action, all approaches to 
defaultcombat
defaultting
default violence against women and girls must include these groups 
defaultand specific protection programming 
defaultbe established 
defaultto address this issue.
default  
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.7 DFID has taken
default multiple
default steps to improve its
default inclusive approach, including s
defaultpecific
defaultally
default mention
defaulting
default older and disabled people as vulnerable groups in their humanitarian policy
default. 
defaultHowever, the single mention of disability in this policy highlights the need to build 
defaultD
defaultFID’s commitment to targeting the most vulnerable.  
defaultAppreciating that disasters affect different people differently, 
defaultunderstanding the dynamic nature of risk is key to planning and implementing inclusive and effective humanitarian response and development defaultprogramming.default  DFID’s challenge 
defaultto 
defaultmake inclusion systematic
default 
defaultcan be facilitated by
default:
default developing specific
default inclusion
default indicators for measuring project success
default;
default requiring partners to include
default action points that target people with specific needs in their operations
default;
default and disaggregating data by age and disability.
default&#xa0;
default2.8 
defaultRecommendations 
defaultto
default DFID’s humanitarian team to improve 
defaultdisability 
defaultinclusion into a consoli
defaultdated and structured approach are:
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRequire that all
default 
defaultDFID 
defaultproposals include specific consideration for the inclusion of people with disabilities 
defaultand ensure that funded 
defaultemergency 
defaultresponses meet the basic and specific 
defaultneeds of 
defaultpeople
default with disabilities, older people
default,
default and 
defaultpeople
default with injuries.
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRequire
default DFID implementing partners to d
defaultisaggregate data by disability.
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEnsure that all assessment, monitoring, and response activities are inclusive.  
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEnsure responses are informed by evidence which includes input from 
defaultpeople
default with disabilities.
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultInclude 
defaultpeople
default with disabilities (and other vulnerable groups) proactively in the development of disaster resilient communities through emergency and disaster risk reduction programming. 
defaultConsult
default and involve people with disabilities in the development of all DFID supported disaster risk reduction programming.
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPromote 
defaulta 
defaultVfM
default approach that focuses on equity and inclusion 
defaultand encourage 
defaultstakeholders to develop innovative, contextually adapted, and multi-scaled operations that cover the needs of 
defaultall
default disaster affected 
defaultpeople
default.
default&#xa0;
default3. Armed Violence Reduction 
default  
default3.1 
defaultArmed violence threatdefaultensdefault people’s safety and securitydefault, defaultundermines poverty reduction, development, social cohesion, human rights effortsdefault,default and 
defaultresults in over 16 million injuries requiring medical attention each year
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.2 Globally, 
defaulttwo million people livdefaultedefault with firearm injuries sustained in non-conflict settings over the past decadedefault. Research indicates that 
default80% of victims consulted developed a severe disability as a result of their injury and need long term medical and social care
default.
default Their injuries generate considerable direct and indirect costs, including those incurred through treatment, recovery, and lost productivity.  
defaultMany injuries negative
defaultly
default impact
default 
defaulthouseholds, disrupting social
default relations
default and creating 
defaultsevere gender inequalities
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.3 
defaultAn estimated 
default740,000
default people die every year from armed violence
default. 
defaultArmed violence is one of the defaulttop ten causes of death defaultin over 40 countries and the fourth leading cause of death
default for people aged
default 15-
default44 globally.
default defaultFor every person who dies, thousands more are injured.  
defaultOnly by integrating armed violence reduction into development 
defaultactivit
defaulties in a multi-sector process involving multiple 
defaultand diverse actors can stakeholders address the combined local, national, 
defaultand 
defaultregional
default 
defaultfactors which drive armed violence
default. 
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default defaultWomen and girls with disabilities are twice as likely to experience gender based violence 
defaultas
default non-disabled peers
default.  In settings where arms are readily available, 
defaultrisks to women and children increasedefault  with weapons used to 
defaultboth threaten and implement violence
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.
default5
default 
defaultIn 2011, over 4,000 people were killed or injured by landmines 
defaultand
default 
defaultexplosive remnants of war
default.
default 
defaultVictim assistance is an essential component of all mine action programmingdefault.  Meeting
default survivors’ needs demands a holistic approach that addresses social, economic, livelihoods, and health and rehabilitation services, access to which
default improves the quality of life of victims and their inclusion in 
defaultsociety.  
defaultWhilst DFID’s newly-published Mine Action Strategy has taken a complete view on the ‘five pillars’ of Mine Action, it has direct
defaulted
default responsibility for responding to victim assistance outside the immediate remit of its own Mine Action
default response, making
default it incumbent on DFID country programmes
default 
defaultto ensure that provision is made for victim assistance support.
default Handicap 
defaultInternational’s own experience of mine action programming across all five pillars demonstrates that a mine action programme 
defaultis only
default successful when victim assistance is fully integrated.

defaultmagnitude, scope, and characteristics of armed violence to inform policy and practice
default. 
default

defaultBuild capacity to implement National Injury Surveillance Systems. 
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIntegrate victim assistance into broader human rights, disability, and development frameworks beyond health and rehabilitation interventions.  
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultExamine how victim assistance can be effectively supported beyond mine clearance

defaulto 
defaultHealth across humanitarian and long-term programming
default&#xa0;
default4.
default1
default defaultPeopledefault with disabilities are more likely to have health needs, but are less likely to access health services and have these needs metdefault.  They are twice as likely to 
defaultfind health care providers’ skills and facilities inadequate, thrice as likely to be denied health care, and four times more likely to be 
defaulttreated badly in the healthcare system
default.  
defaultAchievements in health
default mean that 
defaultpeople are living longer
default, but 
defaultlack of equitable access to a full continuity of care
default means that people of all ages experience 
defaultpreventable disabilities. 
defaultHealth services must better address accessibility, affordability, inclusiveness, appropriateness, and quality for 
defaultpeople
default with disabilities.  
default&#xa0;
default4.2 
defaultInclusivity in health initiatives and programmes aiming to reach the defaultmost marginalised and vulnerabledefault populations cannotdefault bedefault achievedefaultddefault without meeting the needs of defaultpeopledefault with disabilities.default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;
default4.

default 
defaultIn many low-income and middle-income countries, 
defaultonly 
default5%–15% of people who require assistive devices/technologies receive themdefault.
default 
defaultHealth services
default such as 
defaultrehabilitation therapies
default are perceived as a luxury and are 
defaultwoefully limited.  
defaultEnsuring full continuity of care, including 
defaultaccess to
default appropriate rehabilitation services, for 
defaultpeople
default with disabilities and 
defaultpeople
default experiencing new impairments due to illness or injury is critical.
default&#xa0;
default4.
default5
default Costs of health services exacerbate the poverty level for people with a disabilitydefault.  defaultHealth services and systems should increase involvement of
default people
default with disabilities in the development, implementat
defaultion, and evaluation of services to ensure their accessibility and viability for populations at risk.
default&#xa0;
default4.

default 
defaultRehabilitation services must be an integral part of health servicesdefault, especially in humanitarian response and development.  DFID

defaultdisasters
default such as the Philippines typhoon.  DFID’s recognition of the importance of rehabilitation professionals in trauma response, and as an integral part of the health service package, is lauded both for universal access and to improve holistic humanitarian response in major disasters.
default 
defaultRehabilitation services are key to avoid
defaulting
default permanent impairments for 
defaultpeople
default with injuries.
default In long
defaulter
default-term global health and development initiatives, however, the focus on reduction in mortality (aligned to current MDGs) has meant that rehabilitation services have been largely overlooked. 
default&#xa0;
default4.7
default 
defaultSurvival needs to be redefined to go beyond the process of preventing death to preventing impairment and promoting meaningfuldefault 
defaultlivesdefault.  Advances in global 
defaulthealth, highlighted in the 2010 Global Burden of Disease reported and published in the Lancet, have cr
defaulteated new challenges of chronic diseases, longer life expectancy, and increasing rates of disability.  Health partners have a duty to respond to and address these emerging trends multi-dimensionally through prevention, rehabilitation, and treatment
default.

defaultinclude: 
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPrioritise universal access to health 
defaultservices, including for people with disabilities.
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRequire DFID funded global health interventions

defaultinclude targets which better address morbidities and disability within the health sector
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

default 
default&#xa0;
default5. Education
default 
default 
default 
default&#xa0;
default5.1 
defaultThe MDG of achieving universal primary education by 2015 is 
defaultnot on track
default, according to UNESCO
default: 57 million primary aged children are still out of school. 
defaultOf these, 
defaultone third are children with disabilities
default, and an
default estimated 
default90% of children living with a disability in low and middle income countries do not attend schooldefault.
default  Of those who are in school, an esti
defaultmated 250 million children are 
defaultfailing to learn
default.
default&#xa0;
default5.2 
defaultInclusive education is both a right in itself and the means for realising the civil, political, and economic rights of all defaultchildren default(as stipulated in the CRPD)
default.
default 
default It 
defaultis the central means for achieving the goals of 
defaultEducation for All
default, 
defaultfulfilling the 
defaultsecond and third 2015 M
defaultDG
defaults
default and is mentioned explicitly in goal 3 of the proposed sustainable development goals post-2015
default. By

defaultpromote
defaults education that is inclusive, child
default-
defaultfriendly
default,
default and gender sensitive
default.  
default   
default&#xa0;
default5.
default3
default 
defaultPrioritising inclusive education should not be thought of in terms of an additional cost burden.default 
defaultT
defaulthe cost of failing to invest in the education of children with disabilities has been estimated to be much greater than the estimated cost of implementing inclusive education
default. defaultBy one estimate, US$135–192 billion is lost from the GDP of low-income countries per annum as a result of disabled people’s exclusion from employment
default. The World Bank concluded that educating children with disabilities reduces welfare costs and increases potential productivity and wealth creation
default,
default in turn helping to alleviate poverty
default.
default&#xa0;
default5.
default4
default 
defaultDFID’s September announcement by Parliamentary Undersecretary of State Lynne Featherstone that 
defaultall school construction DFdefaultIdefaultD supports is designed to allow disability accessdefault 
defaultis a welcome step.  However, this must be followed by a comprehensive inclusive education approach
default.  Reproducing 
defaultDFID’s Rwanda country programme focus on inclusive education would be an excellent first step. Handicap International is committed to partnering with 
defaultDFID to define clear targets and accountability measures to ensure the effective implementation of future commitments to inclusive education, such as ensuring DFID-supported teacher-training 
defaultincorporates inclusive teaching methods 
defaultrespecting the diversity of learners
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default5
default.

default With the 2014 Global Campaign for Education theme being 
defaultDisability and Inclusion
default, this is an ideal time for DFID to increase its efforts
default on Inclusive Education.default 
defaultRdefaultecommendationsdefault include:
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDeveloping a strategic approach to equity and inclusion of children with disabilities and a coherent policy towards inclusive education (including accessible school design, child friendly environments
default,
default and inclusive teaching methods) across all countries where DFID operates.
default

default6. Recommendatio
defaultns for DFID
default6.1 
defaultHandicap International seeks to build a vision of inclusive development based on:
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultActive participation of disabled 
defaultpeople in all aspects of development and emergency response/recovery, including basic needs, health, rehabilitation, protection, education, mine action, socioeconomic empowerment and reduction of 
defaultarmed violence.
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaultargeted measures that support the development of and meet 
defaultthe 
defaultspecific needs of 
defaultpeople
default with disabilities.
defaultTo facilitate this, Handicap International 
defaulthas gathered examples of good practice for disability inclusive development on their 
defaultMaking it Work
default project’s website
default.
default&#xa0;
default6.2 
defaultBased on Handicap International’s 
defaultexperience, 
defaultto ensure that the
default UK achieves compliance to the 
defaultCRPD
default to promote the rights and full participation of 
defaultpeople
default with disability and ensure fully inclusive development and humanitarian practice
default,
default 
defaultHandicap International calls on DFID to implement a strategic approach to disability inclusion through:
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDeveloping a Disability Theory of Change through active co
defaultllaboration with civil society. 
defaultHandicap International commits to supporting 
defaultthis process which would enable DFID to demonstrate its advanced thinking on the critical issue of disability inclusion.
default 
defaultAs 
defaultthe key process from which all other DFID commitments stem
default, a robust Theory of Change will create a natural flow to the following commitments: 
default

defaultTools for inclusive funding mechanisms and data disaggregation, supporting all steps throughout the development, roll out
default,
default and training of the tools
default.
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultData disaggregation in all DFID’s humanitarian and civil society programmes.
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMechanisms that ensure the effective participation of 
defaultpeople
default with disabilities at all stages of programming.
default&#xa0;
default6.3 
defaultFurther, Handicap International asks DFID to:
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultInfluence the UN agencies
default it funds via the multi-lateral system to ensure they include disability, age, and injury concerns in their work.
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultStrengthen existing internal 
defaultdisability 
defaultinclusion advisory work across humanitarian and civil society DFID teams and identify senior focal points.
default
