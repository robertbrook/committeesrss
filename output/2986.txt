[[[? ]]]Network wide road tolling might in future offer important opportunities to attract private investment in support of the development of the strategic road network.Nonetheless Suffolk Chamber of Commerce is concerned that any such development should be properly thought through and consulted on and managed in a way that is equitable to all road users across the UK trunk road network. The Chamber and many of our partners have significant reservations about the Government’s current proposal to impose tolls on the A14 Huntingdon to Cambridge route, once improved, for the following reasons: &#xa0;In this instance the formal consultation process by the Highways Agency was badly conceived and poorly implemented. Suffolk Chamber of Commerce and many of our partners have responded to the consultation, and written to the Chancellor, asking that no decision should be taken on tolling the A14, until the full economic impact has been properly assessed and considered by all those likely to be affected, and a satisfactory response has been given to our very real concerns that Government’s proposals for tolling will act as an arbitrary and unfair tax on Suffolk businesses.We therefore recommend that the Transport Committee should aim to ensure that, whatever mechanisms are identified for Government to increase investment in strategic roads and attract new investors, the needs of business and the economy are not disregarded as they have so far been in the case of tolling the A14. The Highways Agency should be steered in future to work with the grain of business, and in the interests of UK plc, rather than against it.

[[[ sector play to ensure better management of the strategic road network?]]]Suffolk Chamber of Commerce has concerns about the Highways Agency’s current culture and performance which arise from the fact that it is remote and disconnected from businesses and local communities with regard to planning and managing the strategic road network.Although we believe that the Agency needs strong management and perhaps greater independence from Government, and more involvement by private finance, some of the Chamber’s recent experiences suggest that unless the Agency achieves major cultural change in respect of its relationship with the private sector then it will continue to fail to capture the latent benefits of private sector partnership workingTwo recent examples illustrate this point. First, the Agency recently drew together a group of strategic partners in connection with a number of challenges around the A14 and, not least, the congestion that frequently occurs on or close to the Orwell crossing just outside Ipswich. The Agency convened a summit with MPs and senior representatives from the local authorities but made no attempt to reach the Chamber or any other business voice organisations. An opportunity was lost to secure the input from some of the major users of the A14 which links the Port of Felixstowe to the Midlands and therefore acts as an economic driver for Suffolk, East Anglia and indeed UK plc.Second, the Agency has very recently consulted on proposed improvements to the A14 between Huntingdon and Cambridge and on proposals to toll the new route. Suffolk Chamber of Commerce supports the improvements but at the same time has strong concerns at Government proposals to partly fund those improvements through tolling.The public consultation exercise, led for Government by the Highways Agency and regarding the proposed improvements and tolling arrangements, was launched on 9 September and concluded on 13 October 2013.The Chamber’s concerns about the consultation process are based on a number of specific circumstances which again illustrate the Agency’s disconnectedness from businesses and communities. In particular:All of this suggested to us that Government through the Agency had already concluded that the improvements and proposed tolling are not a major issue for business in Suffolk and other counties outside Cambridgeshire. This is not correct of course and seems to us to sit uncomfortably with Government’s wish to secure a wide base of financial contributions towards the project, both up-front from local partners and in the longer term through tolling.Whatever structural changes are made the Highways Agency will not become “the world’s leading highway operator” unless it works collaboratively and positively with businesses and local communities.&#xa0;October 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
