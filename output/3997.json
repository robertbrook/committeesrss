"&#xa0;\nWritten Evidence Submitted by NAPIT RegistrationResponse SummaryCombatting Lack of Consumer Awareness of Competent People: \nThe creation of\n one consumer facing\n quality mark\n for all competent electricians\n, \nunderpinned by a\n \nlist\n to allow\n \nconsumer marketing to ali\ngn across all electrical scheme providers\n should help to increase consumer awareness of compe\ntent people\n.\n The additional requirement in the DCLG \nconditions\n of authorisation will also help combat this \nissue:\n \nThe scheme operator shall advertise the scheme, explaining its purpose and benefits, to encourage potential members to join and use by customers.\nCombatting Lack of Consumer Awareness of Building Regulation Requirements: the complexity of conveying \nwork that is and is not notifiable coupled with a lack of enforcement of building regulation compliance result in consumer awareness being low.\n \nIf all \nelectrical work which warrants an electrical certificate require\nd\n notification under Part P, and the nu\nmb\ner of routes to notification was\n reduced to \ntwo, \nCPS registered \nelectrical installers\n or DIY signed off by LABC\n, the message would be a lot easier to convey and understand. This approach coupled with giving Local A\nuthorities greater powers, such as the abi\nlity to issue on the spot fines,\n \nfor\n non-compliance or lack of necessary notification\n would also help raise awareness.\nThe extent and adequacy of the review of those carrying out electrical works to which building regulations apply: If those carrying out work to building regulations are registered with a Competent Person Scheme (CPS), their \ninstallation and testing \nwork, \nhealth and safety measures, indemnity and liability insurance, proof of qualifications, relevant technical documen\nts, complaints log, correct testing and safety instruments, in-date calibration certificates, details and evidence of the monitoring of subcontracting staff \nare\n \ninspected \nannually to ensure compliance\n with scheme requirements and building regulations\n.\nThe extent of training of those carrying out electrical work under CPS: NAPIT do not agree with t\nhe Qualified Supervisor model, requiring only one person within an enterprise to meet the required standard set out in the EAS document\n.\n \nThe removal of the phrase \n‘or adequately supervised’ at \nclause\n \n11.1 in the EAS 2012 document\n would dramatically improve the skill level which those working for a certified company would need to be brought up to, and would improve \noverall \nsafety levels in the industry. \nEffect of Competition on standards and review of electrical work: The introduction of DCLG Conditions of Authorisation have standardised requirements for all CPS providers. This means that standards and the quality of review will all have to comply with the high stan\ndards set out in DCLG requirements by June 2014. The introduction of such standardisation means that only the positive aspects of competition remain.\nAdequacy of Supervision by DCLG of accreditation schemes: S\nupervision of scheme providers will be signific\nantly improved under DCLG\n’\ns new Conditions of Authorisation\n which involve rigorous inspections by UKAS\n an independent committee for each scheme operator and an increase in reporting to the Department\n. \n&#xa0;About NAPIT RegistrationNAPIT Registration is authorised by DCLG to operate \na\n \nCompetent Person Scheme. The scope of our \nauthorisation enables us to register\n a variety of tradespeople \na\ns\n \ncompetent to self-certificate their own work, including: electricians, plumbers, heating speci\nalists\n,\n ventilation/ air conditioning \nand building fabric installers\n. NAPIT is currently the second largest registration body for electrical co\nn\ntractors\n, with over 9,000 electrical enterprises registered\n.\nResponses to CLG select Committee Questions:a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe extent to which members of the public are aware of the competent persons scheme and that certain domestic electrical works need to be reviewed and certified to meet the requirements of Building Regulations;&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCompetent Person Scheme&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTh\ne \nissue \nof\n the\n lack of consumer awareness of ‘Competent People’ \nwas\n raised as early as 2009 \nby DCLG\n.\n It was \nalso \nemphasised during the consultation stage preceding the April 2013 changes to Part P of the Building Regulations.\n \nIn response to these concerns\n, \nthe Governm\nent\n agreed to\n in\ntroduce\n new provisions which required scheme \nproviders\n to promote and publicise the benefits of Competent Person Schemes and raise public awareness of the\nir\n responsibility to comply with the Building Regulations.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNAPIT have adhered to \nthis requirement. We\n have always invested \nin the promotion of our members\n \nvia NAPIT \nbut\n,\n \nin the past 18 mo\nnths\n,\n we have gone one step further and have invested \nin significant\n marketing efforts\n and a considerable amount of money \nin advertising\n \nto promote \nthe use of \nall \ncompetent\n registered electricians via\n the ElectricSafe\n R\negister\n. \n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNAPIT accept that awareness is still low but have reason to believe that \nrecent \nmarketing ef\nforts \nhave g\none some way to improving this. Our c\nonsumer facing promo\nt\nion \nhas been \nconsiderable\n, including\n: a\n local\n radio campaign, reaching\n 29 sta\ntions; a\n local newspa\nper campaign featured in\n 80 newspapers on a quarterly ba\nsis;\n \na\n roadside billboard campai\ngn with advertisements in\n 50 prominent road\nside sites \nacross the country\n;\n and a Lon\ndon underground marketing drive saw tubecar posters displayed inside 500 trains\n.\n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere have recently been concerns expressed over the potential for confusion amongst consu\nm\ners as there is more than one register that references electrical firms registered \nunder Part P of the Building Regulations. In order to overcome these concerns we have recently held a meeting with \nECA, Certsure and the Electrical Safety Council\n and have agreed to seek to develop one ea\ns\nily identifiable quality mark, underpinned by a reg\nister of all full scope Part P registered electr\ni\ncians, that provides a single point of reference for consumers to refer to when seeking an ele\nc\ntrician to do electrical work in their home.\n&#xa0;\n1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is anticipated that the proposal will include all licensed Part\n P Scheme Operators in England and Wales who meet the new scheme requirements in line with DCLG’s timeline, and would lead to the removal from the market place of both existing registers (ElectricSafe Register and the Electrical Safety Register).  We along\n with the above mentioned organisations have written to the Parliamentary Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government setting out our intentions and seeking Government support in this regard\n1.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe combined resources of all electrical CPS provider\ns \nshould \ngo a long way to improving awareness of electrical safety in the home and the importance of using com\npetent, registered electricians.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAwareness of the Building Regulations1.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAwareness of the Building Regulations \nrequirements \nalso remains low.\n \nA\n surv\ney \ncommissioned by ElectricSafe\n, highlighted\n that only 28.40 per cent of respondents knew what the term “Part P registered electrician” meant and \na worrying 41 per cent of householders \nwere not aware that it was their responsibility to ensure notifiable \nelectrical work complies with the Building Regul\na\ntions. \n&#xa0;\n1.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhis is \nlikely to be \ndue to the complexity of the different notifications routes available\n \nand the technical nature of the distinction between notifiable an\nd non-\nnotifiable electrical work (made mo\nre \ncomplicated\n following the re\ncent changes to Part P which \ncame into force in April 2013).\n \nWe therefore propose that all electrical work which warrants a BS7671 electrical installation certificate should require notification under Part P, and that the number of routes to notification be reduced to certification by CPS registered electricians or Building Control, allied with an individual licence to practice. This would make the message to consumers a lot easier to convey.\n&#xa0;\n1.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, the problem is not just\n one of complexity\n. Lack of e\nnforcement also undermines the Competent P\ne\nrson S\ncheme provider’s ability to raise awareness among the general public. Householders are currently responsible for compliance \nbut, due to Local Authorities’ lack of resources and r\neluctance to bring sanctions against people with an understandable lack of electrical knowledge, \nare rarely\n penalised\n for\n non-\ncompliance.\n There is also no legal requirement for homeowners to have regul\nar electrical safety checks, meaning unsafe work \ncan o\nften go unnoticed until an accident occurs.\n \nThis enforcement landscape means there is little to no financial incentive for the consumer to make sure work complies, and therefore little incentive for them to pursue a better understanding of the regulations. We therefore propose that the CLG Select committee consider recommending that Local authorities are given greater powers, such as the ability to issue on the spot fines to electricians and/or homeowners responsible for instances of Building Regulation non-compliance or lack of necessary notification. &#xa0;\nb)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe extent to which those carrying out electrical works are adequately trained to meet the requirements of the Building Regulations and the extent to which all those working for a company are brought up to the same level of skills;&#xa0;-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAdequacy of training requirements2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHistorically, the \nentry \ntra\nining requirements demanded\n by\n \nscheme providers \nhave been variable.\n NAPIT\n’s\n com\npetency requirements have always \nbeen \nhigh\n. \n In the past, we\n have required the following qual\nifications and experience\n from those wishing to register on the full scope electrical scheme:\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn 2012 the G\novernment set new Conditions of Authorisation for CPS self-certification schemes following the recommendation of a previous Select Committee\n.\n These con\nditions \nmandate much more precise and uniform standards.\n \n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAmong these \nnew conditions is the requirement that all CPS providers\n achieve and maintain UKAS accreditation to standard BS EN 45011: 1998 \n(or\n latest equivalent)\n. \nUKAS deliver accreditation to \nthis standard by ensuring all\n CPS providers\n comply with the Electrotechnical Assessment Specification\n (EAS)\n.\n The EAS \ninterprets and applies the \ngeneric \nstandards set out in the latest conditions of authorisation mandated by DCLG and sets out the minimum r\nequirements to be met by an \nEnterprise \nfor them to be recognised as technically competent\n \nby a \nRegistration Body.\n \n2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEAS 2012 is a significant improvement on its predecessor (2010). For examp\nle\n the\n route to being deemed competent \nwithout\n prior \nexperience is \nno longer\n a\nvailable\n under EAS 2012\n. This \neffectively closes the route to “competency” previously referred to within the trade as the “five day wonder” (an electrician deemed competent after only a short course). NAPIT have never \njust \naccepted such minimal \ntraining criteria but it is a positive step for the industry as a whole that this loophole in previous competency requirements has been closed\n. \nThe entry requirements \nnow \nspecify \nthe\n exact\n qualifications requ\nired\n,\n leaving no room for\n misapplication\n.\n2.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nC\norrec\nt application of t\nhes\ne specifications will be adequate in preparing\n those applying to meet the requirements of the Building Regulations. Moreover, because \nall CPS providers will be required to assess the qualifications \nand experience of their members in li\nne with the\nse\n \nrobust criteria\n from 2014\n, steps have already been taken to improve the standard and enforcement of trainin\ng requirements which \nshould \nbe allowed to\n take full effect before they \ncan be evaluated for success.\nThe extent to which all those working for a company are brought up to the same level of skills2.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThough NAPIT broadly support \nthe requirements of the EAS, there is one aspect of this\n document we \ndo not agree with;\n the documents’ \nreference to “assessed enterprises” and \n“qualified supervisors”\n \n(QS)\n.\n \n2.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the EAS document, t\nhe term QS\n \nmeans\n that CPS \nproviders\n are \nonly \nrequired\n \nto assess the compe\ntency of one individual within each\n register\ned enterprise. \nThe QS model may\n \nallow “electricians” who may be \nneither properly trained nor genuinely \nmonitored to carry out electrical installations\n.\n \nQualified supervisors \nare ultimately responsible for confirming the saf\nety \nand compliance \nof\n these\n installation\ns\n but, as part of a busy electrical contracting firm, perhaps supervising multiple individuals, \ntheir ability to adequately check electrical works at all stages of the installation process is questionable. \nT\nhe removal of the phrase \n‘or adequately supervised’ at \nclause\n \n11.1 in the EAS 2012 document\n  would dramatically improve the skill level which those working for a certified company would need to be brought up to, and would improve safety levels in the industry.\n2.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNAPIT have ne\nver subscribed to this model. Our current application form requires the a\npplicant \nto \ndeclare that they \nprovide evidence of training and or experience for all operatives carrying out installation work\n.\n W\ne require the person who takes responsibility for the inspection, tes\nt\ning and certification to be qualified and to be \nthe\n comp\netent person\n (often resulting in nume\nr\nous competent people within a company)\n. This doesn’t necessarily mean that every individual within a company must be assessed every year, but that the same amount of inspection effort can be refocused to look beyond th\nis single QS individual and see how competent work is deli\nv\nered by other individuals\n.\n&#xa0;\nIndividual licence to practice&#xa0;\n2.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn \nour \n2012 submission to \nthe CLG\n Select Committee, we made the case for an individual licence to practice.\n \nAn individual license to \npractice would mean that every electrician undertaking work which requires an electrical certificate would need to be registered and assessed as co\nm\npetent in order to carry out electrical work. \nWe emphasised that \nthis was widely supported by electricians, \nhighlighting an in\ndustry wide consultation\n that\n showed\n 78 per cent \nof our members \nsupported the c\nase for individual licensing. \n&#xa0;\n2.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThough a licence to practice would require new legis\nlation, we noted that it \nwould \nremove the need for local authority inspecti\non and create a clear marketplace for the consumer which would improve understanding and awareness. \nRequiring a licence to work on notifiable electrical installations has the\n very real\n potential to significantly reduce dangerous work carried out by un-regi\nstered tradespeople\n,\n simplify the process of enforcement\n, ensure sufficient training is unde\nr\ntaken by all those being paid to undertake electrical work\n and\n push rogue electricians to the p\ne\nriph\nery\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nC) The extent to which those carrying out electrical works, to which the Building Regulations apply, review or have their work reviewed to ensure that it meets the requirements of the Regulations; &#xa0;\n3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf those carrying out work to building regulations are registered with a Competent Person Scheme (CPS), their \nwork, working practices, compliance with health and safety, accounts, insurance, safety and testing equipment and staff documents are \ninspected \nannually to ensure compliance with scheme requirements and building regulations.\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNAPIT\n’\ns annual assessment check\nlist is comprehensive and \nincludes\n;\n demonstrat\ning\n \ns\nuitable installation work to verify technical competence\n and compliance\n;\n \ndemonstrat\ning\n that risks have been assessed and appropriate controls are put in place where required; \nthe access to and use of correctly calibrated equipment; \nand demonstrat\ning\n their knowledge of regulations and fundamental principles.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;D)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe adequacy of the review of electrical works carried out by Competent Persons&#xa0;4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe assessment\n NAPIT \ncarries out on its \nregistered full scope electrici\nans does not just include the \ninspection of \nelectrical work carried out by the registrant, it\n also requires that\n th\ney demonstrate; compliant health\n and safety measures\n, adequate indemnity and liability insu\nrance, proof of qualifications, relevant technical documents, a complaints log, correct testing and safety instruments, in-date calibration certificates, details and evidence of the monitoring \nof subcontracting staff etc\n.\n \n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUpdated technical assessment cri\nteria, with which compliance will be mandatory from \nJune 2014, are set out in section 15 of the EAS \n2012 \ndocument\n.\n \n We feel these require\nments are adequate and reflect those\n historically required by NAPIT. \n4.3 \nIn a recent survey, the NAPIT Trade association found that \n86.4%\n of full scope electrical members thought that the review of elect\nrical work carried out by us is\n ad\nequate.\n \n4.4 In surveys carried out over the \nlast \nfour years over 4000 consumers have been \nasked if they were satisfied with the quality of work carried out \nby the NAPIT member involved and 99% have said that they were satisfied with 96% saying that the would recommend the electrician to others.\n4.5 The number of complaints we receive about our \nmembers is also a useful indica\ntor of the quality of their \nwork and therefore\n the adeq\nuacy of our review procedures\n. NAPIT’s complaint ratio is currently 1 compliant in every \n5000 \njobs \n(\nor 0.5 complaints a year per \nhundred \nmember\ns)\n. \n&#xa0;\nE)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe effect of competition between accreditation bodies, and the two separate registers of electricians, on the standards of review of domestic electrical work; &#xa0;\n5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCompetition between accreditation bodies has a number of effects. Lowering standards to compete is not something NA\nPIT have subscribed to as we believe that many competent electricians reject this approach. \n5.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAny tendency to lower standards is \nalready \nbeing counteracted by the \ncondition that all CPS providers adhere to the revised EAS document (2012)\n which includes higher standards\n. NAPIT believe this will \nmitigate any \nopportunity \nfor s\ntandards to be lowered,\n as those who do so \nafter June 2014\n \nwill \nhave their DCLG auth\norisation revoked\n. \n5.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAnother negative aspect of competition wh\nich has been seen in th\ne past was\n “scheme\n provider\n hopping\n”, where a member of \na scheme could be excluded, but then join another scheme and carry on working even though they were not deemed to be able to do so by a previous CPS provider\n. \nT\nhis is already being addressed by CPS pr\noviders in line with point 14 of DCLGs new conditions of authorisation\n.\n5.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe other side of this argument is that competition gives electrician’s choice. If they are unhappy with a particular aspect of a scheme, they are able to vote with their feet and mov\ne to another.  \nNAPIT believe this is very positive for the provision of the competent person scheme \nin general \nas it prevents providers from becoming complacent and enco\nur\nages them to provide \nan efficient service that also represents value for money\n.\n This\n has encouraged scheme providers to \noffer their members more\n services\n and was one of the factors that influenced NAPITs\n Complete Solution approach\n, an approach which enables our\n members to more easily and cost effectively \nnotify work across multiple work a\nreas\n which they have demonstrated competence in\n. \n5.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe introduction of DCLG Conditions of Authorisation have standardised requirements for all CPS providers. This means that standards and the quality of review will all have to comply with the high standards\n set out in DCLG requirements by June 2014. The introduction of such standardisation means that only the positive aspects of competition remain. \nf) The adequacy of the supervision by DCLG of the accreditation schemes. 5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDCLG has responde\nd\n to the concerns\n a\nbout the adequacy of the supervision of CPS providers by introducing standardised \n Conditions of Authorisation \nwhich all scheme must comply with by June 2014\n.\n6.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe conditions of authorisation mean all scheme providers are now required to gain UKAS accredit\nation. UKAS now assess NAPIT\n several \ntimes \neach \nyear. \nIn 2013 to date UKAS have spent 17 person-days with NAPIT both at the headquarters and witnessing NAPIT at work assessing scheme members. This far exceeds the degree of monitoring that the Department wa\ns conducting prior to accreditation.\n6.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAll the CPS providers \nare also \nnow \nrequired by DCLG to \nsubmit a detailed report on the English and Welsh provision of the Competent Person Scheme, including details of; marketing, complaints\n and \nmembership \nstatistics. \nU\nKAS also report their findings to the Department. \nThis gives DCLG a lot more insight in to the way CPS providers are operating.\n6.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOne key element of accreditation is that EN45011 requires an independent committee (sometimes called an impartiality committee, \nin NAPIT’s case it\ns Governing Board) who independently review the operations of a scheme operator, make recommendations as they see fit, and have the power to report the scheme operator to UKAS or the Department if their advice is not followed. DCLG requir\ne this to be in place by June 2014 but NAPIT’s Governing Board has been in place since 2009 and has been found to be of great value in helping us to identify and deliver real improvements to the benefit of scheme members, consumers and the government.\n23 November 2013\n2\n&#xa0;\n \nI\nET (October 2012). \nELECTROTECHNICAL \nASSESSMENT \nSPECIFICATION FOR USE BY \nCERTIFICATION \nAND \nREGISTRATION BODIES\n \np 7\n \nDCLG (Dec 2009)., \nBuilding Regulations Competent person self\n‑\ncertification schemes: c\nonsultation paper\n \nEC Harris (\nJanuary 2012)\n.,\n Economic and analytical support for impact assessment of proposals to amend the Building Regulations in 2013\n, \nDepartment for\n Communities and Local Government\n \nCommunities and Local Government., BUILDING REGULATIONS: COMPETENT PERSON SELF-CERTIFICATION SCHEMES - CONDITIONS OF AUTHORISATION FROM 6 JUNE 2012 \nhttps://www.gov.uk/building-regulations-competent-person-schemes\n (point 6, p2)\n \nhttp://www.electricsaferegister.co.uk/news/elec\ntricsafe-campaign-reaches-millions-across-the-country.aspx\nhttp://www.electricsaferegister.co.uk/news/electricsafe-campaign-reaches-\nover-half-a-million-consumers.aspx\n Self-certification by a \nCPS \nscheme member\n, \ncertification by local authority Building Control\n, \ncertification by A\npproved \nI\nnspectors, \nacceptance by Building Control of a certificate from a qualified but unregistered el\nectrician, \nand third party certification\n (\ndue in \n2014)\n BS 7671:2008\n., Requirements for electrical installations.
