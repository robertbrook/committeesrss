"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Allan Levine [FBB0052]&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSummary:\n&#xa0;\nThe following is my personal view based on observations and scrutiny of BBC output and actions over the last decade. \n&#xa0;\nNot only failing to meet the requirements of its charter, but its unethical \ngreedy \nself-serving agenda is a clear negative force undermin\ning the values of our society.  \n&#xa0;\nThe cloak of respectability and impartiality which the licence fee gives it must be removed for it not to do further damage to this nation.\n \n&#xa0;\nAt present, the charter does not guarantee independence\n in any publicly desirable sense\n, but\n enabled more\n what has become a totalitarian propaganda \npower, \nbeyond real public control, and must be terminated for the benefit of real democracy\n, social cohesion and stability based on long established human values,\n \nand education.\n&#xa0;\nSome of the e\nvidence\n \nsupporting my view\n, particularly from more recent \ntimes\n,\n is as follows\n:\n&#xa0;\nScandals&#xa0;\nReveal\ned: Tape that shows BBC chief 'did know of \nSavile\n probe'\n \n      \n      \nLord Patt\nen must find out the truth about Jimmy \nSavile\n, Mark Thompson and the Pollard Review\n           \n \nWhy Nick Po\nllard's report on Jimmy \nSavile\n just doesn't make sense\nJames Harding’s right:\n the BBC must do some ‘accountability journalism’, but on the \nSavile\n scandal report\n&#xa0;\nBias&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
