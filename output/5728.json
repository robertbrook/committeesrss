\nRichard Drax, Jim Fitzpatrick, \nMrs Emma Lewell-Buck, \nIain McKenzie, Sheryll Murray, \nNeil Parish, Mr Mark Spencer, Roger Williams\nQuestions \n[\n59\n-\n112\n]\nQ59 &#xa0; \nChair: Good afternoon.  A very special, warm welcome to Professor \nBeddington\n for agreeing to participate in our Inquiry on Food Security this afternoon.  A little bit of housekeeping: we may have to break for one vote, so we will come back as quickly as we can.  Looking at your excellent Foresight Report on the \n‘\nFuture of Food and Farming\n’\n, it was very comprehensive.  What would you draw as the main implications from the findings for food production systems in the \nUK\n? \nProfessor Beddington: \nG\nood afternoon everyone, \nand \nthank you Chair.  It is slightly strange, I should say\n; \nthe last few times I have been in front of Committees I have had half a dozen officials looking after me and carrying my coat and giving me briefings, and so on.  I will not say I feel entirely naked, but I feel a bit different coming in front of you today. \nThere are some key issues that I probably should focus on, which I think are important, and they are ubiquitous really.  The focus was global, but they were pointing to a few things\n: one \nwas the importance of sustainability, sustainable intensification; the issue of consumption; the issue of waste; the issue of research funding; issues to do with the way that agriculture is likely to link in with climate change, in particular in terms of volatility\n; \nand thinking about ways that we could be rather cleverer about dealing with the food system as a whole.  Those were the general things. \nAfter a year we did a review\n—\nit was quite a long time ago now\n—\nof what actions had been taken, and they had been really quite pleasing\n.  A \nlot of the recommendations in the report were taken up by Defra, and that work continues.  The Research Councils took up quite a lot of the agenda.  It is fair to say that the report has had also quite a lot of influence internationally.  In the first year after we produced it we gave presentations at the World Bank, the Food and Agriculture Organisation, and the International Food Agency, and so on. \nAt the moment, what I am seeing is that the sort of implicit messages that came out of that report are still rather relevant today.  One of the exercises that followed on from the report was to say what \nthe \n100 key questions for agriculture\n are.  \nIn fact, on Monday there is a meeting in the Royal Society to ask what some of the key questions for \nUK\n agriculture are, and that discussion meeting is going to happen on Monday evening next week\nThe first thing to say is that, when the report came out, we had had three or four decades of declining real prices\n; \npeople did not think very much about agriculture as being important.  There had been a decline in investment in production agriculture over those decades\n.  The \nfocus had been much more on the environmental impact and issues of animal welfare, and so on, perfectly reasonably, but the report did wake up the community that this was really important.  I am answering rather at length\n; \nshall I just stop there? \nChair: I am sure you will have the opportunity to comment more fully. \nProfessor Beddington: Okay\n, \nthat\n is what I thought. \nQ60 &#xa0; \nChair: First of all, congratulations on both the comprehensiveness \n of the report \nand on the international recognition that \nit \nhas achieved, which you must be very pleased with as the author.  Without prejudicing what might be discussed at the Royal Society, just looking first of all \nat home, \nwhat three actions would Defra take that you think would further food security just now? \nProfessor Beddington: Can I put it in a global context, because I do not think—\nChair: We come on to global afterwards.\nProfessor Beddington: I understand\n that\n.  I do not think you can isolate the \nUnited Kingdom\n \nfrom the rest of the world.  I think the global context of food security is, if anything, more severe now than it was three years ago when the report was written.  There are three things that I would point to: one is the enormous expected increase in the world population, another billion people by 2025; \nthe \nsecond is a big increase in urbanisation worldwide\n.  The \nexpectation going out just 12 years\n is that \nabout 60% of the world will be the urban environment.  \nThe other thing that is really happening, which in a sense is a good thing, is increasing prosperity\n.  A \nlot of people are still in poverty, but the middle classes in the world are increasingly dramatically.  Just a rough figure would give you\n an idea that currently about 1\n&#xa0;\nbillion people in the developing world could be thought of as middle class\n; \nthat is increasing by 100 million a year, so it will double in about 10 years.  That is the context, and all of these things point to increasing demand for natural resources\n—\nwater, food and energy\n—\nso that is the context we are in.  \nQ61 &#xa0; \nChair: We will come on to those, but can I just ask you, locally we have seen great rafts of land under water, particularly in Somerset, and there is a call for farmland to be treated like any other property, particularly when you have got livestock that have been displaced on it and crops being ruined on it\n?  \nDo you personally believe that farmland should be offered better protection from flooding and be recognised as property in its own right? \nProfessor Beddington: It would depend on which bits of farmland and where it is\n actually.  \nI do not think there is a general answer to that\n.  One \nneeds to be thinking about natural equity and compensation if that was found to be the case.  To go to your original question\n on the key things\n, one of the things that is really important for the \nUK\n \nand we are seeing it now, is \nenormous fluctuations in weather.  Historically agriculture has been, in a sense, dependent on its history, that what had worked in the past is likely to work in the future.  The issue with climate change is going to mean that we are going to see increasing volatility\n.\nQ62 &#xa0; \nChair: I accept that; that is the bigger picture.  I am just asking you\n if \nyou think that we, as a country, should recognise farmland as property\n.  I\nf we are losing farmland to flooding, is this impacting on food security? \nProfessor Beddington: I th\nought I had answered that, \nChair, by saying that it depended which farmland\n and that, in any situation, \nthere would need to be some sort of equity consideration.  If it is seen as more appropriate to use some farmland in that way, I do not think one would want to be generic that you should definitely do it in all cases or you should do it in some cases.  I do not think that is a sensible way to do it, but the obvious issues are to do with alternatives; for example, we have an issue in terms of productivity of the \nUK\n food industry.  The trade balance is about £20 billion difference in terms of imports and exports\n.  For \nthe good of the country, one could be thinking about more productivity on basic land in the \nUK\n. \nQ63 &#xa0; \nChair: Just on that point, are you concerned about the levels of self\n&#x2011;\nsufficiency in food production in thi\ns country?  It is currently 62%;\n should it be higher? \nProfessor Beddington: It is an awkward one that, because if one has, as it were, a slightly myopic view of self\n&#x2011;\nsufficiency\n,\n there have been real problems.  For example, the export bans on cereals that occurred in 2010\n&#x2011;\n11 contributed quite substantially but not entirely, primarily \nby \nthe \nUkraine\n and \nRussia\n, to food spikes and hardship caused by them, and similar export bans occurred on rice in previous years, so there is a problem.  Currently it is something like 60% self\n&#x2011;\nsufficiency, and is 60% the right answer, or is 62.3% the right answer?  I think 100% is manifestly the wrong answer.  There are going to be things around the margin where one can pose the question of whether one should rely on imports or try to improve on exports.  To an extent, the market, the consumer and the food system itself will drive that.  \nI see no particular problem in a policy position saying it would be nice to increase our self\n&#x2011;\nsufficiency, but it would be foolish to believe that you could increase self\n&#x2011;\nsufficiency by a dramatic amount, and that would be consumer\n&#x2011;\ndriven\n, because consumers like a variety.  It is unlikely we are going to grow coffee in \nKent\n, for example. \nQ64 &#xa0; \nChair: Do you think there are any lessons that could be learned in terms of food security from the horsemeat adulteration, particularly with regard to traceability and making the supply chain more resilient? \nProfessor Beddington: There are some issues here that are quite complicated.  One of the ones is really whether there is a food safety issue, but also a question of fraudulent practice.  I do not think that there is much to learn beyond that particular thing that there are apparently fraudulent activities.  In terms of food security, I do not see that there is much to be learned from that, other than the fact that we do have the ability to detect adulterated products to really rather quite detailed levels.  \nIt is almost a joke that, if one used the level of testing, it is pretty certain you would find human DNA at some level, just because somebody had touched it.  One can have a ridiculous situation where one was saying, “no DNA other than the actual specified product”, and that is just not workable.  The pragmatic decision was taken at the time saying it has got to be greater than 1% before you take it seriously, and I was in Government at the time; I thought that was a very sensible and pragmatic decision. \nQ65 &#xa0; \nSheryll Murray: Professor \nBeddington\n, \ndoes \nthe \nUK\n \nhave\n a role in responding to the imbalances in supply and demand for food at a global and a regional level? \nProfessor Beddington: Could you perhaps expand on what you are looking for there because, although I heard the question perfectly adequately, I did not quite understand what sort of answer you were looking for? \nQ66 &#xa0; \nSheryll Murray: Basically, what should the \nUK\n’s response be to ensure its own food security in the context of future expected global changes in supply and demand? \nProfessor Beddington: I see, thank you.  We are in the pleasant position that we can buy on the world market and many of the products are available on the world market.  We are a sufficiently prosperous country that we can do it.  From time to time, we will see shortages of certain products in which the price will go up as normal price mechanisms.  In terms of a \nUK\n response, one would be looking—again, it is round the margin of how self\n&#x2011;\nsufficient we want to be.  Is it attractive, for example, that we are dependent on a couple of countries for coffee?  Well, we do not have any choice, because we are not going to be able to grow it here. \nIn terms of the amount of wheat that we currently grow, we could grow rather more wheat, but could it be grown more cheaply elsewhere?  I think the answer is yes.  It might be possible with fairly high inputs to grow other products, maize, soya and so on.  The question is really an economic rather than a scientific one: we could do it, but is that a particularly sensible thing to be doing?  It will be round the margin.  In a sense, the self\n&#x2011;\nsufficiency answer that I gave to the Chair would probably be much the same as I would give here.  We could do it, with some exceptions, but the question is one of economics and the market. \nQ67 &#xa0; \nSheryll Murray: What should the balance of responsibility be between Defra and DFID in addressing the imbalance at regional and global levels? \nProfessor Beddington: That is an interesting question.  This is the sort of question I was asked when I was the chief scientist in Government and now, outside, I am allowed to answer it.  There is a funny feeling of freedom, is there not?  The first thing to say is that they clearly have to work together and, indeed, they do.  If we think about the sort of activities that DFID is doing, and they do put a lot of money into the agricultural research system, they work together.  One of the things that I could point to, which is some degree of achievement, is that the chief scientists of Defra and DFID meet regularly; they meet once a week, and that is the sensible way of co\n&#x2011;\nordinating at least the scientific work.  \nIn terms of the overall policy, it is highly unlikely that DFID, for example, if it wanted to go in for food aid, would see to buy in the \nUK\n, because they can buy cheaper on the world markets.  Learning about research, I particularly think that the area of climate change is where co\n&#x2011;\noperation is important.  Both Defra and DFID fund, for example, the Hadley Centre at the Met Office.  Essentially the agendas are complementary, but the same research questions need to be posed. \nChair: That has sparked a lot of interest.  \nQ68 &#xa0; \nIain McKenzie: When you intimated that they are certain crops that we do not grow in this country or will not grow in this country, how far ahead do we place orders for those foods?  Is the order that is placed in a quantity that says, “We will pull X% amount of your production that year”?  How do we place that order? \nProfessor Beddington: I do not know that I would seek to do it that way, if I understand the question.  There is a real issue to do with how closely involved the farming community is with \nthese sorts of policies.  There are various regulations that can be brought in as policies, and there are taxes and so on, but in terms of the farming community’s response the key is going to be the market and how they would response from a market point of view.  Perhaps I misunderstood your question, because you are looking puzzled.\nQ69 &#xa0; \nIain McKenzie: No, I am just wondering if we had this year a particularly bad year across the globe for certain crops, would we take that into account.  Would we project ahead and place that order, if there was a reduced supply, so that we would still take a large percentage of that? \nProfessor Beddington: It depends on the size of the organisation.  If we think about the big retailers, they will certainly be looking ahead at whether there are likely to be any shortages of a particular crop, say coffee or chocolate.  They will be looking at alternative suppliers, because one of the things about the global food system is that you can look to alternative countries, so if there has been a disastrous harvest in one country you can look to another country for an alternative supply.  That is pretty much what, from what I understand, the big retailers do.  \nIf you were thinking about more common products, wheat and so on, the futures market is the way that that tends to work, and in a sense decisions will be taken both by people wanting to hedge prices, but also to buy forward.  I think that is the way the market is currently working.  If I may, Chair, I must say most of the questions are asking me about things to do with economics, and I was the Chief Scientific Adviser and still am a scientist, rather than an economist, I should say. \nChair: You are doing very well.  \nQ70 &#xa0; \nJim Fitzpatrick: Professor, Sir John, very good to see you again and on such good form.  In terms of your answer to Mr\n&#xa0;\nMcKenzie, given that we have got some of the best brains in the country coming into Select Committees giving us answers, the surprise for me is that more of us do not look more puzzled more of the time, but that is because we have got poker faces sometimes and we do not show it.  \nJust something occurred to me in terms of \nUK\n food production, the ability to feed ourselves and the figure of 60-something per cent.  Given climate change, and notwithstanding that farming is subsidised, given that we are operating in a free market, do you think that pattern is going to change, so that we will be exporting more in the future, because what we produce is more valuable?  Do you think that we will be producing more in the future and importing less?  How do you think that balance is going to change in the foreseeable? \nProfessor Beddington: The honest answer to that, Mr Fitzpatrick, is that I do not know.  What I can say is some of the things that will affect it.  The first thing to say is that probably, if we are looking in the next two or three decades, the UK is going to suffer less ill effects from climate change than some other parts of the world.  To that extent, we are fortunate.  Most of the assessments that had come from analysis of climate change are saying that essentially \nNorthern Europe\n and the temperate zones of the Northern Hemisphere are actually going to have relatively benign results from climate change.  With warming you may see things like the wheat belt move north in \nCanada\n, \nUkraine\n and \nRussia\n, and so on.  \nHere, I think that we are fairly small in a world context.  We might expect to see some areas actually increase; others would be less.  One of the problems, and perhaps I should expand on that now, is that we are going to see an awful lot more volatility.  The point I was making to the Chair’s question was that farming has tended to rely on history, and the past is not going \nto be anything like such a good guide \nin \nthe future, because we do know that we are going to see more volatility and more extreme events, and that is going to affect agriculture.  \nThe consequence of that, which I do think is important, is that we really are going to need better ability to forecast weather.  We obviously do it in terms of issues to do with human life, or property damage due to flooding, and so on, but I think there is real scope for linking meteorological prediction more closely to the farming community.  Everybody watches \nCountryfile\n these days or listens to \nFarming Today\n and you get a forecast, but it is well within the capability of our meteorologists now to predict on forecasts of a few days away very accurately, but also giving you some idea three or four weeks ahead.  \nFor example, not this last winter but the previous winter, it was pretty much predicted we were going to have a very, very cold period at the tail end of January or, last summer, that we were going to have a fairly mild autumn.  These are the sort of things that the farming community could benefit from a lot, I believe, and that is one of the things that I would be seeing as a change that will happen. \nIn answer to your general question, are we going to be producing more or less, it will depend a lot on the commodity.  If, for example, we do see the sort of warming that is expected, I suspect we may be producing rather more horticultural products \nw\nhen we \nhave \npreviously imported\n them\n.  \nQ71 &#xa0; \nSheryll Murray: Turning to your remark about another 1 billion population by 2025, will there not be a reduction in the birth rate as the emerging and developing economy income rises?   \nProfessor Beddington: That is a very good question.  From what we know about the sociology of fertility there are three factors that affect it: one is prosperity\n; \nthe other is the education of women\n; \nand the third is the availability of contraception.  Due to the way that the world population has changed, what we are looking at is essentially 500 million \nadditional Africans by 2025 and\n 500 million additional Asians.  Africa has a bigger effect, because the current population is 1 billion; the current population of \nAsia\n is about 4 billion.  \nAlbeit that you may see declines in fertility with increasing prosperity that comes after quite a time lag, and the current rate of increase is lower than it was 10\n&#x2011;\n15 years ago in most countries\n but, \nbecause you have \nmuch larger populations, \nthe basic increment is\n much higher.  I find it breath\ntaking if I think about putting Africa together with the urbanisation population growth in \nAfrica\n.  It \nis saying that in 12 years’ time there will be about 1,000 \nadditional \ncities the size of \nEdinburgh\n.  \nI find that\n a breath\ntaking statistic and it will not be much affected by gradual declines in female fertility, but I do think on a timescale of 20 years or so\n \nthese issues of population must be addressed.  They have got to come \nup \nto the forefront\n \nbecause\n,\n if you do not get the decl\nine in fertility that one hopes, \nyou are not talking about a population of 9 or 10 billion\n; \nyou are talking about a couple of billion more, and that is truly problematic for civil society.   \nQ72 &#xa0; \nIain McKenzie: Do you see more farmers taking dramatic steps to protect their crops in the future from extreme weather, and against slippage in seasons as well? \nProfessor Beddington: The honest \nanswer, Mr McKenzie, \nis I really do not know\n.  I\n&#xa0;\nam not au fait with the farming community at quite that level of detail, \nso \nyou would get a better \nor \nmore informed answer from the NFU or farmers’ organisations.  What I would expect to see is that, for example, there would be more attempts to improve drainage\n; \nto be thinking about \ninputs that would provide protection against significant excess rain.  I also think you will start to see some changes in crop varieties as people decide to invest, depending on weather, on crop varieties that are more resistant to drought, or more resistant to excessive rain. \nYou will see that, but it will be a relatively gradual change, except in areas like, for example, East Anglia, where you have the potential of flood surge or something, where people will have to think hard about dykes and keeping those in good repair.  \nQ73 &#xa0; \nNeil Parish: Good afternoon\n,\n Professor \nBeddington\n.  Further to Jim Fitzpatrick’s question, the Secretary of State wants to encourage consumers to buy more British food.  Is there an optimum balance between imported and domestically produced food? \nProfessor Beddington: I do not really think so.  It would depend on the product, and I do not think you can say\n that \n60% \nis \noptimum or 62.4% \nis \noptimum\n?\n  I just do not think there is an answer like that.  What you can reasonably say, and you need to analyse it by product, is to \nask if \nit \nis \npossible to encourage the growth of a consumer appetite to buy British\n.  \nIf we are going back to the horsemeat scandal, I think you have seen a big change there in consumer habits, as they have focused more on\n British\n&#x2011;\nproduced\n product.  It is quite possible to see that consumer change.  \nI also think it is possible to be thinking about putting research into areas where you could be thinking about growing particular products more successfully in the \nUnited Kingdom\n environment than you have hitherto\n \nand, again, that is a perfectly sensible thing to do.  One cannot attune these things to something approaching an optimum\n \nbut, in a sense, if the direction of travel is that one erodes what is a trade defici\nt in food products of about £20\n&#xa0;\nbillion, then it has to be a direction of travel that is attractive to the country.  How much and how far you are going to be able to achieve that with different interventions is pretty much impossible to say at present.  \nQ74 &#xa0; \nNeil Parish: Linked to Sheryll Murray’s question is that with the increase in world population, you also made the point that there would be 100\n million more every year becoming \nmiddle class\n.  They \nwill eat more meat.  It is not very fashionable to talk about meat production, but in the end we will need more meat in the world.  I know Jim will not necessarily eat it, but there will be people eating it.  \nTherefore, \nis there an argument that more meat will be absorbed across the world, so we need to increase our meat production in this country? \nProfessor Beddington: It is an economic situation, is it not?  Most of the increase in meat consumption is primarily in \nAsia\n.  Actually, \nthere has been very little in \nIndia\n \nand that area of the world in \nSouth Asia\n.  In fact, there are very big increases in dairy consumption there, so it is slightly different.  In terms of the \nUK\n, it would be possible, but it would depend on a lot of other things.  One of the problems about meat production, particularly chicken and pork at the moment, and\n \nindeed\n \nparts of the beef industry, is the cost of grain, which is being fed.  It is basically an economic argument.  I suppose it might be arguable that one should be thinking about intervening in farming and subsidising production of lamb or beef, and so on, but that is fairly unfashionable too. \nQ75 &#xa0; \nNeil Parish: Okay, I will not press you further.  As far as seasonal crops are concerned, one of the things about buying more British is that in the supermarket you will find that people want strawberries in \nJanuary.  They \nmay not taste of anything, but they want them.  If we are going to grow more crops out of season, which we can, but probably through greenhouses, \npolytunnels\n \nor whatever, what is the likely impact of that? \nProfessor Beddington: Taking strawberries, you have seen quite a substantial\n increase in home\n&#x2011;\ngrown product being used.  At the moment it is pretty unlikely we are going to grow much in mid-December, especially the December that we have just had, or the January we have just had, even under artificial light.  You have seen that increase primarily by either greenhouses or under sheltered production. \n \nI would expect that to happen in certain horticulture products\n; \nothers less so.  Strawberries are a good case, where you have seen quite a substantial increase in the last decade. \nQ76 &#xa0; \nNeil Parish: What about the obstacles, in your opinion, to a more diversified agriculture\n in the \nUK\n?  Is \nit planning?  What is it?\nProfessor Beddington: I have not really given it\n any thought, I am afraid, \nMr Par\nish.  I feel agriculture is fairly diversified\n.  It \nis a \nmarket\n&#x2011;\ndriven\n activity\n; \nit is choice.  One of the dilemmas, for example, is whether you grow \nbiofuels\n on grade A land. \nQ77 &#xa0; \nNeil Parish: I think you \nwill \nget a question about that in a minute.  For instance, should we hav\ne more big greenhouses such as Tha\nnet Earth, for instance? \nProfessor Beddington: \nOf \ncourse\n \nyou had Professor Benton and Professor \nCrute\n with you\n.  They \nare Th\nanet Earth fans, are they not?  It is an interesting question\n \nbecause, in effect, that sort of production can be highly productive on not particularly good quality land.  That is going to be really important\n.  W\ne have in the \nUnited Kingdom\n \nreally quite limited amounts of very high quality land\n.  C\nould we be thinking about using \nbrownfield\n sites for the production of horticulture?  I think the answer is, yes\n; \nit is a fairly substantial capital investment, but it could arguably pay off.  \nThe question that we need to be pondering is, going back to questions of national \nfood security, self\n&#x2011;\nsufficiency\n and so on, which we have covered\n, \ndo you really want to have a planning regime that allows top quality agricultural land to have alternative uses?  In a sense it is a political question, not \none \nthat I would comment on.  \nQ78 &#xa0; \nNeil Parish: \nSuch as solar farms\n and the like? \nProfessor Beddington: Yes, indeed.  \nNeil Parish: I am leading the witness. \nQ79 &#xa0; \nChair: What is the attraction of purple tomatoes? \nProfessor Beddington: Purple tomatoes?  This is the GM variety they have been developing in—\nNeil Parish: Very good quality, \nI imagine. \nProfessor Beddington: In John Innes.  It is a consumer issue, is it not?  With any GM product it is not a consumer issue, because it is an issue of regulation by the European Commission, driven by the European Community.  \nOf the ones I would single out, p\nurple tomatoes is an attractive one, but the GM technology that has been developed at \nRothamsted\n and the John Innes \nCentre\n, two \nof our \nreally top \nworld\n&#x2011;\nrated\n institutions\n, the blight\n&#x2011;\nfree\n potato that has been developed at John Innes could save an enormous amount of pesticide use.  The recent thing from last year\n was \nwhen \nRothamsted\n developed a wheat strain, \nin \nwhich they inserted a peppermint gene, which produced a pheromone that i\ns the alarm pheromone of aphids.  That \nhas the potential for growing wheat without any infestation of aphids whatsoever, and the aphids are not even lost to the ecosystem\n \nbecause they just do not go there. \n \nThese sorts of GM technologies are really quite exciting.  \nThere was another one coming out of \nRothamsted\n—\na plant that could produce essentially the equivalent of fish oils, the Omega 3 plants\n.  T\nhere was a lot of publicity about\n that\n.  Again, we had the technology in our institutions.  The problem we have is European regulation, both driven by political considerations\n \nand a view that, in a sense, that it is enormously difficult to get \na product licence\n.  The ability to get a GM product \nlicenc\ne in \nEurope\n is extremely difficult, and costs vast amounts of money, so that it is very hard to imagine any organisation other than a large profitable multinational doing it.  We are really losing out here. \nChair: We come on\n to that; \nI was just\n making a flippant remark.\nProfessor Beddington: We come on to that, okay.  You asked me about GM product. \nChair: I \njust \ndo not like the thought of purple tomatoes\n myself.  \nQ80 &#xa0; \nRichard Drax: Professor, can I come on to the increased \ndemand for \nfood, in particular protein\n?  \nI will give you the background, if I\n may, before I ask the question, \nto help you answer it, from the interviews we had previously.  A lot of the soya comes from \nSouth America\n for processed foods, and Professor Benton told us that \n70% \nof foods in the supermarket contain soya.  Professor \nCrute\n cautioned, and I quote, “It may be much more sustainable to produce the protein you want on land in \nBrazil\n that has already been cleared of forest than to \nclear more land in this country\n.\n”\n  The increase of things like meat and dairy in China have increased fivefold per capita\n, again \nProfessor Benton said, \nthe \nend result of which is the challenge of importing large amount\ns\n of soya\n.  I\nf \nChina\n wants more food\n, food prices are going to rise\n.  \nWith \nthis expected increase in demand for protein in countries like \nChina\n, parts of Africa\n and \nSouth East Asia\n, how is this going to be achieved sustainably, do you think? \nProfessor Beddington: There is an interesting issue here\n.  \nBrazil\n is the obvious country to look at, because they produce a very substantial amount of soya protein, primarily for animal consumption.  Most of that is now GM; there is a tiny amount of non\n&#x2011;\nGM soya being produced, to the extent that it is very hard to even find it, because the GM technology for soya is enormously economically attractive.  The fact that non\n&#x2011;\nGM product has some price premium is of indifference to the farmers that are actually producing it. \n \nWe are going to see more GM technology in the developing world, and we import substantial amounts of GM soya now, and it is used for the meat trade. \n \nIn terms of significantly increasing \nthe production \nof—let us take soya, but other protein cereals would be worth thinking about—there is lots of potential.  There are very substantial amounts of lan\nd, which is moderately degraded;\n it is not tropical rainforest in \nBrazil\n, and one could be thinking about expanding there, and I expect people have.  I think the same goes for parts of northern \nArgentina\n, which I expect to see now. \nOddly enough, I think that we will start to see production in parts of \nAfrica\n of high\n&#x2011;\nlevel protein.  \nW\ne have all heard of horror stories of land grabs\n \nand so on\n but, \nas there is de\nvelopment in Sub-Saharan Africa, \nwe may see an increase in production of crops with a high protein content.  There is no doubt there is a shortage of them. \nQ81 &#xa0; \nRichard Drax: What impact is this going to have on the \nUK\n and EU food security over the next 10 to 15 years, do you think? \nProfessor Beddington: The issue is really of a price relationship.  There is a world price for soya\n.  The \nimporting \ncompanies \nbuy on the world marke\nt.  If there becomes a shortage, \nthe price will go up\n \nand it will have an impact on food inflation and general inflation in this country, as it could in the European Union.  I do not think we are going to be in a situation \nof protein starvation\n; \nit is just a price mechanism that will harvest it, and we are a wealthy country compared with other parts of the world.  We will not be in a situation where we will not be able to buy \nin \nthe protein.  The issue is round the margin\n.  It \nis whether, in fact, pig production\n or \nchicken production is going to be profitable \nin \nthe \nUK\n \nif you are \nimporting grains or soya to feed at what is a very high price. \nQ82 &#xa0; \nRichard Drax: What will be the principal resource limitations to increased food output given that land is limited? \nProfessor Beddington: The big ones are clearly water.  Are you asking \nUK\n or worldwide? \nRichard Drax: Yes, \nUK\n. \nProfessor Beddington: Ludicrously there is an issue about water\n.  It \ndoes not feel like it at the moment\n but, in fact, \nmost of the projections are indicating we might expect to have quite a dry South of \nEngland\n, where there will be some issues there.  We have some issues to do with fertiliser, whether it is nitrogen\n&#x2011;\n or phosphorus\n&#x2011;\nbased\n fertiliser, and we need to be thinking hard about that.  There are going to be issues to do with the use of these fertilisers\n \nand\n \nindeed\n \nthe use of pesticides, because we have a major problem of insect pests and fungi\n as well\n. \nThere is some real hope here in terms of the better use of engineering, and what we roughly term \n‘\nprecision agriculture\n’\n.  I was recently at \nHarper\n \nAdams\n \nUniversity\n where they have got a group focusing exactly on trying to have better precision agriculture, so you use less fertiliser, you use less pesticide and you use less water.  There is a real future in that at the \nhigh\n&#x2011;\ntech end. \nThe other thing that I would point \nto as a potential constraint is, I suppose, \nthe weather in general.  We are an island on the edge of a large ocean and on the edge of a large continent, and we have\n really quite variable and very difficult to predict \nweather.  This is one of the reasons when I was answering Mr Fitzpatrick’s question I was saying that I think we really need to be looking quite hard at better prediction in the agricultural area. \nRichard Drax: Just quickly, GM food linked all those\n answers.\nChair: We are coming on to GM.  \nRichard Drax: You are?  In which case, I withdraw.  Thank \nyou very much indeed. \nQ83 &#xa0; \nChair: Can I just ask, are you worried about the impact on food production of water that might be used in \nhydraulic \nfracking\n? \nProfessor Beddington: You asked my colleagues about that, did you not? \nChair: I might have done. \nProfessor Beddington: I think it is a public record now.  Yes, I think it is not going to be a big deal actually, if you think about the amount of water that is actually used in agriculture\n.  \nFracking\n uses a lot\n and \nit might be a local issue, but it is not going to be an issue on a large scale.  \nThe issues to do with water use \nin \nfracking\n are a concern about the pollution of aquifers\n.  A \nreport that I commissioned while I was in Government by the Royal Academy of Engineering and the Royal Society pointed out that\n, \nwith sensible regulation of the wells\n,\n there really \nshould be no danger, because the water aquifers are very substantially separated by about a kilometre from the reservoirs of gas and oil.  To speak quite simply, unless you have got a \nleaky well\nhead, you are not going to do it; there will not be migration between. \n \nThat is pretty much a consensus of the science and engineering community. \n \nThe pollution is an issue, but can be dealt with by regulation.  \nIn terms of the amount of water that is actually needed for \nfracking\n, production of energy, whether it is via \nfracking\n or \nin \nthe normal \nprocesses \nin power stations, does use an awful lot of water, but I can only imagine it being a local effect, rather than a country\n&#x2011;\nwide\n one. \nQ84 &#xa0; \nChair: But you do not actually \nknow.\nProfessor Beddington: I think one does not ever know anything very much, does one, if we are going to be philosophical about this\n?\n  I could enquire, but there are others who \nwould \nhave basically done that calculation, but\n \nin fact\n, one way, \nI do not know.  I \nwould \nsee lots of reasons why it could not be very large, because of the arithmetic really. \nQ85 &#xa0; \nNeil Parish: Just going back to the import of soya, or importing chicken meat and pig \nmeat \nthat has been fed on GM soya, it has the potential to put our own industry out of business.  The irony is that\n, in the end, \npeople will be eating the exact same meat that has been fed on GM products.  Is it not time we and \nEurope\n changed our mind\ns\n on th\nis?  People are still eating it, \nirrespective of whether we use it or not\n.\nProfessor Beddington: \nMy \nown views on the GM ban\ns are that \nthey are not evidence\n&#x2011;\nbased\n. \nChair: We are coming on to that, so we do not want to—\nNeil Parish: Considering, Madam Chairman, \nyou got on to \nfracking\n \nwhich, in my opinion, had absolutely nothing to do with this, I really think that we can actually pursue a question. \nChair: We are coming on to that\n.  \nQ86 &#xa0; \nMrs Lewell&#x2011;Buck: \nProfessor \nBeddington\n, you will be pleased that I have got a bit of \na \nscience question for you.  Earlier you said \nthat the \nUK\n will suffer less from climate change, but obviously bearing in mind that we will be affected by it, what is it that we should be looking at in the longer\n&#x2011;\nterm picture to try and mitigate the future effects of it? \nProfessor Beddington: Do you mean just in agriculture, or do you mean more generally? \nMs Lewell-Buck: Mor\ne generally, if you can.\nProfessor Beddington: The first thing to do is that we do need to continue to invest in the science of climate change.  One of the things that is not really appreciated in our knowledge\n is that \nthe weather we are getting currently is determined not by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere now, but the greenhouse gases that were in the atmosphere in the 1990s.  The climate system has a 20\n&#x2011;\n25\n&#x2011;\nyear time delay in it, so in the 1990s greenhouse gases had accumulated, and the weather we are now seeing is coming from essentially the climate that was determined 25 years ago.  \nIf you extrapolate that, obviously there has been an increase since the 1990s in greenhouse gases, so we know\n that\n, if we look 25 years down the track, the weather we are going to be getting is going to be determined by that increased level.  It is likely to be more volatile\n; it is likely to be \nparticularly volatile if we think about the \nUK\n.  We would also have an expectation \ntherefore that you would get more extreme events\n.  The \nrain will be heavier\n; \nthe droughts will be longer\n; \nheat waves will be more severe.  There is a real consensus that this is the pattern of climate change that we should expect.  \nIt is going to mean issues to do with infrastructure.  In particular, we are going to need to be thinking about \nhow \nwe have flood defences.  The question you were asking me earlier \nwas \nabout whether farmland should be used as a flood defence\n.  \nI heard on the \nToday \nprogramme that the World Wildlife Fund was saying that they thought it should.  It is a question of individual\ns, \nwhere, when, how\n and if it \ncan be done by agreement\n.  \nWe have got to expect more extreme weather, and, in consequence, to hark back to the point I was making, if we are having more extreme weather we have to be able to know it is coming.  We have to be able to know it is coming on as long a time period as we possibly can, and that means continuing research in both climate and meteorology.  That is the science answer.  Whether the South East of England is going to grow peaches, the answer is probably, but I would not like to give you a timescale on it here. \nQ87 &#xa0; \nRoger Williams: Greenhouse gas emissions from livestock production is a very contentious issue. \n There seem\n to be two ways in which you can reduce it, either by altering the management \nor \nhusbandry of the livestock, or by just reducing consumption of livestock products, whether they are dairy or meat.  Should we be doing either or both, or can we do either or both? \nProfessor Beddington: It is a very under\n&#x2011;\nresearched\n project.  In terms of thinking about diet for livestock, there has not been much research on it.  There is now a worldwide programme looking at what interventions can be done for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from livestock, and that really is a big international programme, which a number of our main research institutes and universities are involved in.  There is stuff that can be done\n.  F\nor example, if we are talking about manipulating the\n flora in the rume\nn, one could be thinking about doing that, which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions, when you think about diet. \nThere are also mechanisms whereby substantial intensification means that you can capture the greenhouse emissions as well as the other waste products.  There are obviously costs and benefits \nto \nboth activities.  The question is really one about land use, and that is almost both a regulation and a commercial question.  What is the alternative for our uplands?  \nIt is p\nretty much livestock production or forestry, and in a sense that is a political and economic decision for those who are on the land.  \nThe thing that I would say is\n that\n, if we are talking about the \nUK\n, substantial meat diets with a lot of red meat are known to be unhealthy\n so, \nfrom a public health point of view\n,\n a reduction is important.  Worldwide what we are seeing is a big increase in the appetite for meat, particularly in \nChina\n and \nthe Middle East, \nbut \nless so in \nIndia\n, as I mentioned earlier.  There are quite large areas of the world where livestock is the only possible productive activity for the land\n.  You \ncannot decide whether you are going to grow livestock or you \nare \ngoing to grow wheat\n.  \nLarge parts of land do not have that as an alternative and livestock is the only way.  \nThe thing I feel is that it really has just not been researched enough, and that is a bit of a pity.  When I was in Government I was pushing to say that we need more research on this, and now I am not in Government I will still say it, but probably with a lot less effect.  \nRoger Williams: It is nice to hear that this is being taken seriously on a global scale.  \nProfessor Beddington: It is. \nQ88 &#xa0; \nRoger Williams: Do you think our Government is taking it seriously, either by modifying livestock husbandry or through reduction of consumption? \nProfessor Beddington: The research institutions that are involved are there, and you would have to ask Defra what their current plans are.  I stopped being in Government in April of last year, so I am not quite so up to date with what is actually happening.  As I say, it is the naked feeling of not having officials around who immediately pass me the answer to your question.  I cannot answer, Mr Williams, I am afraid at the moment. \nQ89 &#xa0; \nRoger Williams: You have already mentioned the great value that people in \nBritain\n put on our uplands.  There may be two alternatives, either livestock production or forestation.  Any change in livestock production will have huge changes in the appearance of our uplands, but also the third alternative was on \nCountryfile\n \non Sunday night\n, which\n was George \nMonbiot\n with his concept of \nrewilding\n.  Is it really important that we keep our uplands the way they are\n \nor are \nthere \nreal alternatives? \nProfessor Beddington: Again, it goes down to economics and politics.  In fact, tourism is an important source of income for the country\n.  There \nis a lot of tourism income \nthat \ncomes \ninto the northern uplands\n, because they look like they do at the moment.  Whether birch scrub would be quite as attractive for a tourist visit I would rather doubt.  I did not see the \nMonbiot\n programme\n; \nI was told about it, so I could not comment in any detail.  There are alternative uses\n.  You \ncan think about nature reserves\n and \nusing some areas of land to be more attractive to relatively rare species\n.  \nManifestly that is there, but you are not going to \ndo \nthe whole of the northern uplands in that way, or at least I cannot imagine \nthat \nyou would. \nQ90 &#xa0; \nRoger Williams: There is a lot of mention of the emissions of greenhouse gases from agriculture, but agriculture also takes in a lot of carbon dioxide every year.  \nAre there \ncalculations about netting off the difference between the uptake of carbon dioxide by crops, grass, and goodness k\nnows what against the emissions?  Has that been \ndone accurately\n \nor do you think \nthat \nmore work needs to be done on that? \nProfessor Beddington: It can be done accurately\n.  \nI could not answer in general.  Back in 2011, I chaired an International Commission on Agriculture and Climate Change, and part of that was to say, if we are going to increase food production to the sort of levels that are needed to meet food security issues, and we continue to use the same techniques in agriculture, then greenhouse gas emissions will soar.  There is a real dilemma there.  One of the programmes that has started from that, which is quite substantially funded by the international community, is focusing on climate smart agriculture: i.e. agriculture that is not using substantial amounts of fertilisers that are based on using greenhouse gases, in the Haber\n&#x2011;\nBosch\n process\n \nand so on. \nSome of the techniques that are coming are working quite well.  One of the ones that has been used in parts of Sub\n&#x2011;\nSaharan Africa is agro\n&#x2011;\nforestry\n, so you have crops intermixed with trees.  That has the benefit of both sheltering the crop, but also increasing production. \n I\n&#xa0;\ncould probably let your clerk have reference to that particular report, and there were 10 recommendations that came out of it.  \nOne of the follow\n&#x2011;\nups from that commissioned report was to go to the climate meeting in \nDurban\n in \nSouth Africa\n, and make a proposal that there should be a programme for agriculture as part of the climate change discussions.  That would be a really good thing\n.  It \ndid not get through\n—\nit was not accepted\n—\nbut it still continues, because this is really important.  Agriculture could be\n \nnot just a problem for greenhouse gas emissions\n; \nit could be a significant solution\n, so your point is well taken, \nMr Williams. \nQ91 &#xa0; \nIain McKenzie: Can I take you back briefly on what you touched upon in diet change\n.  You \nsaid \nthat \nthe Government is encouraging\n \ndiet change in all areas of the country.  Governments are encouraging diet change away from certain foods that are grown \ntraditionally\n.  Do you see that beginning to impact on the farming community, what crops they are growing, and do you see that kind of impact in the future, as they move away from potatoes with every meal\n \nand red meat\ns\n? \nProfessor Beddington: I would not expect it to have much effect on farming at the moment, but there are some issues.  There is no doubt that there is an obesity epidemic in the developed world, but also there is an \nincreasing problem with obesity, early\n&#x2011;\nonset\n diabetes and \nearly\n&#x2011;\nonset\n cardiovascular problems in the developing world as well.  They are all diet related.  The irony the people point to is 1 billion people \nin starvation\n&#x2011;\nrelated\n poverty and 1\n&#xa0;\nbillion people \nwho are \nobese\n.  It is \none of the ironies of the world condition. \nThe sorts of questions that are quite interesting are not so much to do with obesity, but to do with malnutrition.  Quite a lot of the crops that are grown in the developing world are insufficient in terms of key nutrients.  I am sorry\n; \nI sound like a bit of a broken record, but I am chairing an International Commission, which is funded by DFID, US\nA\nID, and the Gates Foundation, to look at agriculture and malnutrition.  One of the dilemmas is \nthat \ncountries could grow more wheat, more soya\n \nor more maize.  They would do that, and it would be more profitable, but it would be at the expense of a poorer quality diet.  One needs to be thinking about that\n \nand one answer is supplements\n; \none answer is some form of GM intervention\n \nthat you can actually get better nutrient quality \nfrom \nparticular crops.  I think that is it. \nIn terms of the basic obesity issue, the main issues are prim\narily sugar\n&#x2011;\nrelated\n, are they not?  Most of the sugar is tending to come from sugar cane; I cannot see \nthat \nthis is going to have much effect on the farming community at the moment.  It may do, but\n I doubt it.  What you will see, however, \nis an increase in the organic movement\n and \nwhat is seen as healthier food, although the underlying science behind that is more debatable. \nQ92 &#xa0; \nMr Spencer: I wondered if you could explain in laymen’s terms, for someo\nne simple like me to understand, \nwhat you mean by \n‘\nsustainable intensification\n’.\n \nProfessor Beddington: I could see that one coming, because I read \nthat \nyou asked other people for that. \nMr Spencer: I still have not got the answer\n though\n.  \nProfessor Beddington: You are going to see how consistent we all are.  The idea of intensification is manifestly sensible.  We do not have much land\n; \nwe do have an issue of food production; we need to get more from the same amount of land.  On the other hand, it would be a pretty daft thing to do\n \nto be getting more by having very\n large inputs of fertiliser, \npesticides\n \nand so on.  The intensification and the increase \nin product per unit area need\n to be balanced against how you actually do it. \nQ93 &#xa0; \nMr Spencer: In a global sense or a \nUK\n sense? \nProfessor Beddington: Sustainable intensification can apply to an individual farm, because you could say to an individual farm, “Can you produce more from the same amount of land by increasing some form of changing your management practice?”  Now, if you are changing your management practice in a way that, for example, you ultimately \nmight pollute your water\ncourses\n \nor \nthat you are, for example, \novergrazing and therefore could not continue\n—so \nyou could produce vastly more sheep on the northern uplands for a while, but they would th\nen revert to being unproductive—s\nustainability comes in\n.  I\nntensification is more from less; sustainable intensification is\n not to \nharm the environment in \na \nway that you cannot continue forever, whether it is \nover\ngrazing or \nover\nuse of fertilisers.  \nQ94 &#xa0; \nMr Spencer: Is \nUK\n agriculture fit for purpose?  Can we deliver that in our current form?  \nProf Beddington: We are seeing lots of ways in which we can do it.  I referred earlier, for example, to high\n&#x2011;\nprecision\n agriculture, which is actually doing that.  We are looking at ways in which we can better control insect pests in a more efficient way, rather than just using pesticides.  There is so\n&#x2011;\ncalled “biological pest control” or integrated pest control.  We are using that.  There are a lot of indications that, for example, some nitrogen fertilisers are probably overused, and that you could probably increase the yield by cutting back.  That is certainly the case elsewhere in the world, although whether a particular farm in the \nUK\n is doing that, I do not know and would not comment.  \nThere are things that we can do to increase production.  For example, our typical yields of wheat are about 8\n&#xa0;\ntonnes per hectare.  \nRothamsted\n has a programme that they are following to try to get 20 tonnes per hectare from wheat.  That would be a mix of breeding, agricultural practice, precision agriculture and so on, and they want to do that in 20 years.  I think they started in 2012.  There is a real recognition that this can be done.  Elsewhere in the world, you are seeing these sorts of increases in the level of productivity.  \nQ95 &#xa0; \nMr Spencer: Is that knowledge transfer trickling down to normal farmers?  How are we going to get that knowledge transfer down the pyramid?\nProf Beddington: That is a very good question.  The answer is that this is a thing that Government has certainly understood.  I cannot believe Ian \nCrute\n did not mention the \nAgri\n&#x2011;\nTech\n strategy to you, but this is a strategy that is aimed at making sure that research actually gets used in the farming industry.  It is really important.  There is no point in characters in white coats sitting around in laboratories doing very, very cunning things if it does not actually come down to the farmer and have some practical use.  \nWhen I was in Government, I started the Food Research Partnership, which is ongoing and had the research institutes and the key Government Departments, but also had big agri\n&#x2011;\nbusiness organisations like \nSyngenta\n and big retailers like Marks &amp; Spencer.  It also had the National Farmers’ \nUnion\n and so on.  Part of the programme of that was to say, “How can we better get research results to be used by the individual farmer?”  This is something that I think is really important.  Both the NFU and other organisations are really trying hard to get that done.  Certainly, the research institutions understand that, so there is a big programme of communication.\nQ96 &#xa0; \nMr Spencer: Obviously, taxpayers’ money is finite and we need to get the balance right between applied research, knowledge transfer and, I suppose, the more simplistic measures of how we can improve agriculture and the industrial environmental schemes, if you like.  Where is the balance between those three different types of knowledge requirement?  \nProf Beddington: We do need to be thinking pretty hard about environmental issues, but again it is a policy question.  Would one wish to put aside areas of land that would be very attractive to species that are endangered?  That in a sense is a straight economic choice driven by whatever regulations and incentives are out there.  Other ones are much more regulation.  You really would want, and you really do have, quite strong regulation, for example, on the \nuse of nitrates to protect watercourses.  You have regulation in terms of agricultural chemicals that you are allowed to use, which do actually form the mechanism of protecting the environment.  You need both.  \nQ97 &#xa0; \nMr Spencer: Maybe I did not frame the question in the right way.  What I am saying is, to go to the extreme, you could put all of your money into research and you could let the market, if you like, trickle that knowledge down to producers.  Would that be the right approach?  If not, how much should Government be investing in that knowledge transfer, or is that not their job at all?  \nProf Beddington: In a sense, it is a political decision.  You clearly need to have some fundamental research, but it is important\n—\nand I think Government recognises that\n—\nto work out ways that that research is actually going to be used.  \nThe \nAgri\n&#x2011;\nTech\n strategy that you have all been told about, as part of that, says “We think research should be encouraged but that research needs to go into the appropriate industries,” whether it is in individual farming, the processing industry or the reservation industry.  These are things that need to be done.  I do not think there is an easy answer, again, on what proportion of funding should be done.  That is, in a sense, for debate.  You can manifestly see that the extremes are daft, but where the balance lies is, I think, a political discussion process rather than anything that you would get scientific advice on.  \nQ98 &#xa0; \nRoger Williams: Following on from Mark’s question, in the good old days there would be an extension service like ADAS with experimental farms and things like that.  Now, virtually all the advice that people get is commercial advice, which ends up with the message of “Buy my product,” “Use my piece of equipment” or whatever.  Do you think we have gone too far down that way?  Is there a role for having an organisation that gives advice that looks at the needs of farmers and the environment?  \nProf Beddington: Do you mean ADAS and things like that?  That was very much the conclusion of the Food Research Partnership study.  Again, I will pass that study to the clerk.  I think the sorts of issues you raise are perfectly reasonable.  \nChair: I would just ask you to hold fire on this, because we are coming straight on to that now.\nProf Beddington: So Mr Williams cheated, did he?  He got an extra question in.\nChair: I could not possibly comment at all.\n&#xa0;\nQ99 &#xa0; \nIain McKenzie: A question just popped into my head on the subject of sustainable intensification and efficiency.  Do you think a separate \nScotland\n would re\n&#x2011;\nintroduce\n the run\n&#x2011;\nrig\n system?  You do not need to answer.  \nProf Beddington: The straight answer to that is that I do not know.\nIain McKenzie: We are told there is a gap between scientific research and its translation in the application to farmers.  What is your view on that?  \nProf Beddington: I certainly think that we could do better.  There is no doubt about it at both ends, and the sort of issues that we need to be thinking about are that the research institutes take on the activity of making certain that what they produce is actually readable, and readable by the layman.  One of the most difficult things that I had when I was Chief Scientist was pronouncing the names of various chemicals, because people thought you were an idiot if you got them wrong, so I had to get my officials to give me a phonetic \npronunciation before I went into a meeting.  That is a cautionary tale for research institutes that would tend to produce things full of Latin names and chemical formulae that are actually meaningless to farmers.  There is a proper way of actually dealing with that.  \nSome of the discussions that you have seen recently, for example about that GM crop producing Omega\n&#x2011;\n3, were readable.  It was sensible; people could understand it.  It was not hiding behind complex jargon.  That is one of the things that I would very much encourage and like to see.  To the extent that Government can influence this, I think most people would agree that that is the right thing to be doing.  \nQ100 &#xa0; \nIain McKenzie: Would you say that other EU states are better at assisting their farmers to access technical information?  \nProf Beddington: \nHolland\n is very much better, but I think that that is, in part, because of the type of agriculture that they have, which is a lot involving greenhouse and a lot of fairly intensive pig and poultry.  I think there are mechanisms whereby the research results get rather quicker into the farming community there, but that is an anecdotal feeling rather than any real evidence, Mr McKenzie.  I could not say, for example, whether \nItaly\n is better than \nFrance\n.  I have no idea.\nQ101 &#xa0; \nIain McKenzie: In your opinion, what could the Government do at present to help bridge that gap?\nProfessor Beddington: I think that that is probably a question for my successor and maybe for the Chief Scientist in Defra.  What I can speak for is the university research institutes where I am still involved and to say that it is recognised as an issue and they are trying to do it.  Organisations like the Technology Strategy Board are involved in the \nAgri\n&#x2011;\nTech\n strategy, and part of their job is to move things nearer and nearer to market.  When I was there, we were developing these ideas through the Food Research Partnership, and they have been followed, to an extent, by Defra.\nQ102 &#xa0; \nRoger Williams: As somebody who regrets the fact that GM technology has not been adopted in this country, can you tell us if there is any way in which it can recover its acceptance by the political classes, the public and the Government?\nProfessor Beddington: Just to give you a flavour, I think our research institutions are right at the forefront of research in this area.  The key thing here, of course, is that it is Government research and that there is no intellectual property that is retained; the intellectual property is available to all.  I think that that is really rather important, because the early introduction of GM technology was very much associated with concerns that there was intellectual property, monopoly rights and so on, and that this was, in a sense, an intervention by big business which would generate more monopoly profits and so on.  I think that, at that time, that was probably a reasonable concern.  I do not think that that is the case now.  A lot of the GM research that we have been talking about this afternoon, you will see, is coming out of Government laboratories.\nThe problem that we have is that there is not an evidence base that is sensible.  The Chief Scientist for the European Commission, Anne Glover, who used to be Chief Scientist for \nScotland\n, was quoted last year as saying, “I have seen no evidence that GM crops, when taken, produce any harmful effects on humans or animals.”  Nobody contradicted her in saying, “Here is the evidence,” apart from some groups, and I think that that remains the case.  One needs, with GM technology, to be careful, but it is not a generic thing.  \nThere is a GM potato.  Is it safe?  Does it have these side effects?  There is GM wheat.  Is it safe?  Does it have these side effects?  It is not a thing that you say, à priori, “Let us dismiss it.”  If it can solve a problem and has been properly tested for both human health and environmental safety, prohibiting it a priori seems inappropriate.\nQ103 &#xa0; \nRoger Williams: Do you think that there was an overemphasis on the precautionary principle or was it using the precautionary principle in a way for which it was not intended?\nProfessor Beddington: Yes, I think there is, and I think that the use of the precautionary principle is one that I believe has been overused in arguments about not just GM technology but, for example, about agricultural chemicals.  The issue that is really quite dramatic as an overuse of the precautionary principle, particularly in European legislation, has been the failure to distinguish between hazard and risk.  A hazard is something that, at some large dosage, produces an effect of a carcinogen or an endocrine disruptor, but there is no distinction made on the dose.  If something is a carcinogen or an endocrine disruptor, under certain types of legislation, it would be banned anyway, irrespective that you would have to use enormous dosages to do it.\nThere was a case, when I was in Government, of a chemical called \nbisphenol\n A, which is used in the production of babies’ bottles.  The only way \nbisphenol\n A would hurt children would be if you hit them with a large container containing it.  There is absolutely no evidence that the sort of dosage levels that it was coming in was any harm.  It was a profound misunderstanding of the precautionary principle and the difference between hazard and risk.\nQ104 &#xa0; \nRoger Williams: Do you think that the present stance that the European Union has on GM is affecting food security?\nProfessor Beddington: I think it is actually affecting nutrition and the way that world trade operates, because there is no doubt that, because some countries wish to export into the European Union and there are very strong regulations on GM technology, some states have been discouraged from using GM technology in a situation where they could be helped by it.  I think there is a problem, but the problem is more around nutrition issues.  For example, there is a strain of rice that has a vitamin A supplement which would be extraordinarily helpful in reducing blindness in children.\nQ105 &#xa0; \nChair: If we could just wrap up with a couple of quick\n&#x2011;\nfire\n questions, if we may. Is the issue of GM not to do more with cross-contamination of other crops, being a crowded island and using the technology in this country?\nProfessor Beddington: I do not quite understand the question, Chair.  I am sorry.\nQ106 &#xa0; \nChair: I think you answered Mr Williams’ question as to there being no danger to human health.  I am a sceptic on GM crops; I remain to be convinced.  I\n&#xa0;\nthought one of the difficulties was crossover and cross-contamination on other crops nearby.\nProfessor Beddington: I think it is an evidence base, Chair, and the evidence is not there.  There is certainly cross-contamination of GM crops into others but, in terms of the effect on human health, I know of no evidence whatsoever.\nQ107 &#xa0; \nChair: It is not to human health; it is to other crops.  It is the Prince of Wales’ point that you are going to contaminate crops close by, permanently.\nProfessor Beddington: There are appropriate regulations for spatial separation.  I\n&#xa0;\nthink that needs looking at.  You would not want things to be unregulated, but you need to have proper and appropriate regulation and that is a perfectly reasonable point.\nQ108 &#xa0; \nRichard Drax: Bearing in mind Professor Benton’s comments about 70% of food in supermarkets containing soya, much of which is GM, we are eating this stuff anyway, are we not?  It is being consumed every day, whether we know about it or not, is it not?\nProfessor Beddington: Yes.\nRichard Drax: It is not affecting us in any way.\nProfessor Beddington: There are some statistics pointing to the enormous number of meals using GM product that have been eaten in North America, and there has not been one single case brought by what is a very litigious society on harm to human health that has come from eating GM-related product.\nQ109 &#xa0; \nChair: Could I just ask on \nbiofuels\n?  Should crops be grown for production of \nbiofuels\n and does this have an impact on food security, in your view?\nProfessor Beddington: The simple arithmetic, of course, is that, if you grow \nbiofuels\n on land, you are not going to grow food, so the answer is, in a simplistic way, yes; but it is perfectly reasonable to ask, “Could you grow \nbiofuels\n on land that would not be highly productive for growing alternative arable crops or livestock?”  The answer is yes, they can.  The emphasis should probably be less on first-generation \nbiofuels\n, which are things like sugar cane and so on, which are used to produce ethanol, but on the second and third generation, which are things that can be developed on the basis of agricultural waste.  There is enormous potential for that.  The BBSRC has been running a research programme on that for a long time.\nQ110 &#xa0; \nChair: In terms of the alternatives that you mentioned to uplands—and I have a very large upland area—you mentioned livestock and forestry, and you also mentioned tourism and some others.  Tourism is quite important, but what contribution to food security would a nature reserve and some of the other things that you mentioned make as alternatives to livestock production on uplands?\nProfessor Beddington: In terms of issues to do with nature reserves, if one has an intensification of farming, so you grow more on the same amount of land, you have the scope to have reserves without affecting food security.  I think that that is one of the attractions of them.\nQ111 &#xa0; \nChair: The last question: you last reported in 2011.  How much progress do you think the Government has made in meeting the challenges set out in your Foresight report?\nProfessor Beddington: When I left Government, I was delighted in the sense that both Defra and DFID had taken a lot of the report on.  I think it has had a lot of effect internationally.  To the extent that, when I was there, both successive Secretaries of States took on the issue from that report and said that this had become really important and brought it up the agenda, it has been very important.  There has been a change in emphasis; this is the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee.  Food is rather high up the agenda these days, compared with what might have been the Environment and Rural Affairs Committee if it had not happened.\nChair: Professor Sir John, thank you very much indeed for being with us.\nProfessor Beddington: Thank you very much.\nChair: You have been incredibly generous and very full in your answers, and we are very grateful to you.\nProfessor Beddington: Thank you very much.\nChair: Thank you very much indeed.  \n              \nOral evidence: \nFood Security\n, HC \n926\n              \n              \n2\n"
