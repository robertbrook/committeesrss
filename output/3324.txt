[[[Written evidence submitted by Susan Morrow (IPC0003)]]]My name is Susan Morrow . I am a retired science teacher and an  amateur meterologist/climatoligistAs a follower of climate issueswww.weathercycles.wordpress&#xa0;I feel a basic organisational flaw is inherant in the organisation called the IPCC..The IPCC is 100% AGW lobbyists/scientistsThere are many other climate groups/ scientists that are 100% the opposite. THey are 100% AGW scepticsThe supposed AGW consensus is a fallacyA true outlook on future climate cannot be achieved until the reports incorporate both sides of the debateYou must recognise that the IPCC is 100% biased and committed to AGWscience alone and pays little to no attention to natural variabilityTHe 100% reliance on computer climate simulations is worrying.. THey are beta products untrialled and unprovenTHe IPCC research is selected and chosen with an affirmative position ONLY!!You need to incorportae some of the oppositions science to get a balance of the true body of knowledge of climate scienceThe climate journals are controlled by AGW protaganists and alternative science is squashed or hidden is so called sub standard journalsTHank goodness this input/submission  is a start to governments thinking about the alternative views of many climate scientists who are not AGW advocatesIf the UK met office wants to lead world climate research . THey will not shun and demoralise alternative research.!. Emply some AGW skeptics on an  equal basis!!Climate models should NOT be the main source of climate prediction this early in their developmentNovember 2013&#xa0;
