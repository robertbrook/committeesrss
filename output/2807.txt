[[[Overview]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The extreme weather experienced by the UK between 2009-12 severely challenged the transport sectors ability to keep the network open, safe and serviceable.  Until the winter of 2008-9 the UK had experienced 20 years of relatively mild winters which combined with the public sectors budget pressures, resulted in many local highway authorities (LHAs) reducing their overall pre-season salt stocks levels.  &#xa0;As a consequence of the difficulties, several reviews and inquiries have followed, the outcome of which has seen improvements in the way the UK plans and reacts to future severe winter weather events and a recognition of the importance of the service.&#xa0;Integration of transport networks and the provision of relevant, up-to-date information to passengers, covering all modes is vital to the continued operation of the network during severe weather events.  It was clear from the 2009-10 winter that passengers were often not provided with sufficient information to allow them to make sensible choices, this was identified in the reviews.    It is essential that the flow of information is integrated across transport modes.&#xa0;The treatment of footways and cycleways is also an important component of the local network and needs to be recognised in winter maintenance strategies.  As many LHAs already do, authorities should collaborate with and support lower-tier authorities to help ensure that maximum practical winter support can be given in areas and communities beyond the treated networks, including the treatment of key footways and pedestrianised areas.&#xa0;All transport networks need to ensure that they have disruption plans in place and good communication available to all stakeholders during adverse winter weather (and at all times).  Safety of users of the transport network must be paramount.  &#xa0;Finally, and crucially, budgets for the transport sector need to be set at a sufficient level and certainty to ensure a robust response to adverse winter weather  This should include the ability to allow providers to ‘invest to save’ through the purchase of better plant and materials if needed.&#xa0;

[[[Q1.]]]

[[[How resilient are the UK’s transport networks (including road, rail and air) to adverse winter weather? ]]]&#xa0;

[[[1.1]]]&#xa0; The UK’s transport networks would appear to be better prepared to respond to adverse winter weather, following the severe winter of 2009.  There have been a number of significant reviews and new guidance to the transport sector.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[1.2]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Roads ]]]– the RAC Foundation Report (2013) ‘Ploughing On’ published in May 2013 highlighted that Local Highway Authorities had made good progress in improving their winter resilience.  The report noted that, so far, budgets had been preserved for winter service operations.  CIHT has concerns that a continued pressure on revenue funding for highway authorities could impact on longer term winter resilience.&#xa0;

[[[1.3]]]&#xa0; Most bus routes are on local highway authorities’ winter salting/gritting or snow clearance routes, and therefore are kept clear for bus services to continue to operate in all but the most extreme conditions.  However some services on more minor roads may be affected by adverse weather conditions, where the local authority has not cleared the route, with bus operators unable to provide services on those routes.&#xa0;

[[[1.4]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Rail ]]]– Heavy snowfalls can have serious impacts on the rail network.  Snow clearance systems generally seem to work well in the UK, but there are some disruptions to services, especially in the more remote areas between centres of population.&#xa0;

[[[1.5]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Aviation]]] – As with rail, heavy snowfall can have a serious impact on aviation, however the sector appears to work well.  There are the unavoidable runway closures in extreme conditions, but the main priority of the airport operator and the airlines on these occasions must be passenger safety.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Q2. ]]]

[[[What lessons have been learned since the severe weather experienced in the winter of 2009-10? ]]]

[[[What practical changes have been made to ensure the UK is now better equipped to deal with severe weather? ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[2.1]]]&#xa0; On 12 March 2009 the then Secretary of State (SoS) for Transport, Geoff Hoon, made a statement to Parliament on the severe weather. The statement highlighted problems caused by the heavy snowfall and announced that the UK Roads Liaison Group (UKRLG) would review lessons that can be learnt from the events of early February.  The UKRLG recommended what steps could be adopted by LHAs, trunk road authorities, producers of salt and other stakeholders to ensure the effective treatment of England’s road networks in order to ensure the nation is better prepared should similar events occur in future years. &#xa0;

[[[2.2]]]&#xa0; UKRLG review ‘Lessons from the severe weather February 2009’ was published on 4 August 2009 and included a package of 19 recommendations to develop and improve the highway maintenance for future winters.  &#xa0;

[[[2.3]]]&#xa0; The Government responded to the review in a written Ministerial statement and the Code of Practice for the highways sector, Well-maintained Highways, was updated in tandem with the announcement.&#xa0;

[[[2.4]]]&#xa0; The winter of 2009/10 was the coldest in the UK for 30 years and the duration of freezing temperatures and the extent of coverage of both snow and ice were highly unusual. &#xa0;

[[[2.5]]]&#xa0; With the experience of the second severe winter and with some concern as to whether all the lessons learned from the previous winter had been acted upon, the then SoS for Transport commissioned a further but independent review in March 2010.  A three-man Panel led by David Quarmby, Chair of the RAC Foundation was formed, its purpose to consider and recommend practical measures to improve the response of England’s transport systems to severe winter weather. &#xa0;

[[[2.6]]]&#xa0; The Quarmby review ‘The Resilience of England’s Transport System in Winter’ published in October 2010, endorsed all the recommendations of the UKRLG review and noted that progress had been made by the roads sector.  A significant concern was that the supply of salt for highways was a major issue.  The recommendation in the Interim Report was for a strategic reserve of a quarter of a million tonnes for 2010/11 (this was accepted by Government). &#xa0;

[[[2.7]]]&#xa0; The Review recommended a combination of higher stockholding levels for the beginning of the winter season (with a new resilience bench-mark of 12 days/14 runs pre-season), permanent adoption of lower salt spread rates and a willingness by the two main suppliers to commit to higher throughput rates when the market demands.  If successful these measures would secure sufficient resilience to meet the needs of a severe winter.  &#xa0;

[[[2.8]]]&#xa0; The RAC Foundation report, ‘Ploughing On – A review of highway resilience in Winter 2013’, covering both England and Wales concluded that good progress has been made by local highway authorities in winter service operations. &#xa0;

[[[2.9]]]&#xa0; The report found that, without exception, local authorities are maintaining their level of spending on winter resilience despite general budget cuts. The review found evidence of cooperation between adjacent and intertwined county, district and parish councils; and that this activity was underpinned by improved consultation with local communities and better communications with the media and the public.&#xa0;

[[[2.10]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The report highlights where progress has been made and stated that ‘the valuable initiative and work of the National Winter Service Research Group (NWSRG) should be brought under the wing of the UKRLG’.  Many local highway authorities have reviewed salt spread rates. Following the issue of the revised guidance from the UKRLG, there have been savings in the volumes of salt used. LHA’s are now applying salt at rates that are appropriate to varying circumstances. In practice, some of the salt saved has been redirected into salt bins or salt bags, to support community efforts.&#xa0;

[[[2.11]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; On 18 September 2013 an updated Appendix H to Well-maintained Highways was published.  This latest revision of Appendix H has been carried out under the direction of the NWSRG on behalf of the UKRLG and UK Roads Board using information from the NWSRG Practical Guide for Winter Service (Practical Guide) and NWSRG member organisations, as well as other recent winter service research and information.  The spread rate tables in this guidance should help assist Local Highway Authorities to adopt the most suitable, and efficient in usage terms, salt spreading levels.  &#xa0;

[[[2.12]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As noted at the start of Appendix H:  “The guidance and recommendations contained within Appendix H relate to national Best Practice and it is recognised that local circumstances, including financial and other resource constraints, as well as political influences etc. can vary widely across the country. Authorities and operators will need to take all of these factors fully into account, when devising and revising their Winter Service policies and plans. Some of the recommendations and practices will, if adopted, also take a number of years to implement. For example, it is recognised that, in certain cases it could potentially take up to around 10 years or so for a major programme of change to be fully implemented.”&#xa0;

[[[2.13]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Case study – improved resilience by the Highways Agency through capital ]]]

[[[      ]]]

[[[investment]]]&#xa0;

[[[2.13.1]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Highways Agency invested in a new vehicle fleet which could spread pre-wet. This came on stream between 2008 and 2011.  This was supported by revised treatment guidance implemented which included the use of pre-wet systems which have significantly reduced salt use and therefore made stocks more resilient.&#xa0;Other changes included:  

[[[2.13.2]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Service Provider salt stocks were increased to maximum capacity during summer re-stocking.&#xa0;

[[[2.13.3]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; DfT through HA procured a strategic salt stock of 425000 tonnes of salt located strategically around England. This will be made available in the event of a severe salt shortage to LHA and HA.&#xa0;

[[[2.13.4]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Suppliers increased their production capacity and increased above ground salt stocks to ensure supply&#xa0;

[[[2.13.5]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Supply chain arrangements were put in place to increase the UK supplier base&#xa0;

[[[2.13.6]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Overall the English strategic road network (SRN) is more resilient than in 2009/10 however the UK must be careful not to become complacent particularly following more mild winters&#xa0;

[[[2.14]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Highways Agency and its Service providers are considering implementing outcome lead specifications for winter service. This may lead to cost reduction through efficiencies in resource allocation but could also lead to different levels of  delivery of winter service across England, unless the development of specifications is carefully considered  &#xa0;

[[[2.15]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Rail –]]] Resilience plans should continue to include contingencies for disruption to services, including the provision of rail replacement bus services where appropriate.  Network rail and train operating companies generally have these plans in place, but they will need to continue to work with local highway/transport authorities to ensure that plans remain robust.&#xa0;

[[[2.16]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Aviation]]] 

[[[- ]]]The UK’s aviation industry has made improvements to its ability to deal with severe winter weather. Since 2009-10 Heathrow has invested £50 million in snow and ice clearance equipment and increased staff numbers available for snow clearance and Gatwick has invested a further £8million.  The Civil Aviation Act 2012 gave the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) powers for a new licensing regime, including measures to ensure an airports operational resilience as a license condition (to come into force in 2014). The CAA has formalised its compliance monitoring team which is deployed at airport when there is major disruption to operations, monitoring and ensuring compliance with legislation on assisting passengers when flights are delayed or cancelled, with the powers to employ enforcement orders and penalties.&#xa0;

[[[Q3. ]]]

[[[How well prepared are the Government, local authorities and transport providers for adverse]]]

[[[ winter weather? What more should be done to ensure a coordinated response?]]]&#xa0;

[[[3.1]]]&#xa0; The overall message is that generally all sectors are better prepared than they were in the past but that all those involved in the delivery of a winter service should not be complacent.&#xa0; &#xa0;

[[[3.2]]]&#xa0; The RAC Foundation Report, Ploughing On, identifies some areas of concern and makes an important point that the travelling public should take more responsibility in terms their preparations particularly in making journeys in bad weather.  There may be a need to place more responsibility on road users to ensure they are prepared for severe winter conditions. Many of our European neighbours have legislated to ensure this is the case.  Public expectations can be unrealistic and the role of the media and now social media needs careful consideration. &#xa0;

[[[3.3]]]&#xa0; Further research and improvements to guidance in the use of alternative treatment methods is required. Both Europe and North America make use of a suite of treatment methods and do not rely predominantly on the application of salt. While the UK climate tends to be mild in nature there is still much to be learnt from abroad.  The National Winter Service Research Group (NWSRG) might benefit from this.&#xa0;

[[[3.4]]]&#xa0; As mentioned in point 1.2 above, CIHT has concerns about reduced revenue funding to the sector (particularly Local Highway Authorities). This may have two effects:  firstly on day-to-day operations during a period of severe winter weather (and having sufficient  resources to address the situation); secondly, a lack of funding impedes the ability to take on board some of the more significant changes required through capital investment.&#xa0;

[[[3.5]]]&#xa0; CIHT would recommend that sufficient funding certainty is provided to the transport sector to be able to ‘invest to save’ to better manage winter resilience.  For instance new spreaders can optimise salt usage (and thereby save cost), this would help authorities deliver on more significant change and improvements in the delivery of their winter service operations. &#xa0;

[[[3.6]]]&#xa0; The recognition that Highways incorporate footways and cycle ways is particularly relevant during periods of adverse weather and the recommendations of the Quarmby review are important in this regard. The needs of non-vehicular users and the clarity of advice to householders to support the actions of local highway authorities in keeping footways clear is a continuing area for consideration. The role of funding from across government to reduce the amount of injury from slips and falls is a key area for further development.&#xa0;

[[[3.7]]]&#xa0; It is essential that local highway authorities and bus operators work together to agree those    routes that will routinely be treated, and to clearly identify the routes or parts of routes where bus services may not operate in adverse conditions, with appropriate information being provided to customers.  This is particularly important in those areas, mainly the English metropolitan areas, where local highways and public transport are the responsibility of different authorities.&#xa0;

[[[3.8]]]&#xa0; Bus stations are usually located away from major public highways, and therefore not necessarily on local authorities’ winter salting/gritting or snow clearance routes.  Most bus stations are owned and operated by the relevant local transport authority, and where this is the same as the local highway authority it would be expected that winter treatment of bus stations would be part of the overall treatment strategy.  However, this may not always be the case in areas where local highways and public transport are the responsibility of different authorities, and in these areas it is crucial that the authorities work together on a strategy to ensure that bus stations and the relevant bus routes are properly treated in adverse winter conditions.  Some metropolitan transport authorities keep their own supply of road salt and salting vehicles for use in bus stations, but this seems an unnecessary duplication of effort when the relevant highway authorities have their own equipment and materials, and could add bus stations to their winter treatment routes.&#xa0;

[[[3.9]]]&#xa0; In adverse winter conditions, it is often the case that local highway authorities will prioritise the treatment of roads, but give less attention, if any, to footways.  For car drivers and passengers this may cover all or almost all of their journey, but for bus passengers clearly it will not.  All bus passengers will need to walk a certain distance at the start and finish of their bus journey, and they will be vulnerable to falls and injury if the footways aren’t appropriately treated.  Indeed, many passengers may not make the journey at all, if they have doubts about being able to negotiate footways at either or both ends of their bus journey.  In this respect, older and less able-bodied people are particularly vulnerable.  This should be picked up by local highway/transport authorities and bus operators in developing and implementing their winter resilience strategies.&#xa0;

[[[3.10]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; At times of major disruption to transport operations associated with adverse winter conditions, the dissemination of information to passengers is crucial, to allow them to decide on the options available to them for their journey, or in some cases not to travel at all.  Within their winter resilience strategy, local transport authorities must have systems and procedures in place to provide information to passengers, and they must of course be flexible enough to allow for ever-changing conditions. &#xa0;

[[[3.11]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;  

[[[Rail – ]]]Perhaps the main concerns are around electrified railways, where power supply issues can become critical in heavy snow.  There are generally few problems with 25kV AC overhead power supply systems, but 750V DC third-rail systems, such as exist in SE England and Merseyside, can be seriously affected in heavy snow falls, causing substantial disruption to services.  The longer-term solution is for third-rail systems to be converted to overhead power supply, but this would be expensive, and probably difficult to justify whilst the frequency of serious winter events remains low.  However, the rail industry will need to continue to work on ensuring that third-rail systems are as resilient as possible.&#xa0;

[[[3.12]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Network Rail and train operating companies are usually very good at providing information for their customers when services are disrupted, but as previously identified, this flow of information must be part of an integrated information strategy, covering all transport modes.  In most situations where rail services are disrupted, e.g. for rail engineering works, train operators will provide rail replacement bus services.  This would probably not be possible where the disruption is caused by heavy snow, potentially leaving passengers stranded with no alternative transport.&#xa0;

[[[3.13]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As for bus services, it is important that rail stations and their environs, and at least the main pedestrian routes to/from stations, are kept clear of snow and ice.  The 2009/10 winter weather showed that many passengers were reluctant to travel on snow-cleared rail routes where their walking routes at either end of the rail journey were hazardous.  It is crucial that all relevant agencies work together in developing and implementing robust resilience plans that consider the whole-journey implications for the population.&#xa0;

[[[Concluding remarks]]]The recognition of winter maintenance as a fundamental part of customer services across transport networks has improved since the difficulties after 2009. We believe our comments will lead to the highways and transportation sector continuing to deliver improvements in dealing with an uncertain future scenarios.&#xa0;October 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;http://www.racfoundation.org/assets/rac_foundation/content/downloadables/ploughing_on_winter_resilience_review_smith_may_2013.pdfhttp://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090312/wmstext/90312m0002.htm#09031266000022 http://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/archives/uk-roads-severe-weather-lessons-2009.pdf http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091215/wmstext/91215m0006.htm#09121583000135 http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20111014014059/http://transportwinterresilience.independent.gov.uk/docs/final-report/wrr-final-report-2010-10-22.PDF http://www.ukroadsliaisongroup.org/en/guidance/winter-service-guidance.cfm
