defaultHIV is now a long term condition affecting over 100,000 people in the UK. The number of people living with HIV has trebled in the last ten years. It is therefore necessary to find innovative, more cost-effective ways of delivering HIV care.
default&#xa0;
default2. 
default              
defaultTerrence Higgins Trust supports models of care and support that would deliver savings to the NHS
default and meet growing demand for services
default. These include greater provision of basic HIV care in primary care settings and use of Internet and peer support services, such as our Life Plus service.
default&#xa0;
default3. 
default              
defaultIn order to provide routine care for people with HIV and also as a result of the withdrawal of specialist HIV social care, mainstream 
defaulthealth and social 
defaultcare services need to be better informed about HIV, in order to deliver appropriate care and avoid cases of discrimination.
default&#xa0;
default4. 
default              
defaultThere is a strong association between HIV and mental ill health. Mental ill health can be a result of HIV, but is also exacerbated by financial, social and other personal difficulties. It is also a cause of poor treatment adherence among people with HIV. Psychological and other support should therefore be prioritised in order to support both physical and mental health.
default&#xa0;
default5.
default              
defaultThe over 50s are the fastest growing group of people with HIV in the UK. This group reports twice as many other long term conditions as their peers, and significant anxiety about the readiness of primary and social care services to treat them effectively and without discrimination.
default&#xa0;
defaultIntroductiondefault&#xa0;
default1.1
default              
defaultTerrence Higgins Trust is the UK’s largest HIV and sexual health charity, with 32 service centres across the UK. We are a campaigning and membership organisation which advocates on behalf of people living with or affected by HIV or poor sexual health.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default              
defaultWe provide services for people living with HIV to manage their condition and access emotional and practical support. 
defaultThese include one-to-one counselling, peer support groups, health trainers and information and advice covering benefits, housing, finances, employment and immigration. 
defaultWe 
defaultalso 
defaultdeliver community based clinical services
default,
default such as chlamydia screening and rapid HIV testing
default, and
default health promotion campaigns and initiatives which target populations most at risk of HIV and poor sexual health. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBackground to HIV as a Long Term Conditiondefault&#xa0;
default2.1
default              
defaultSince the 
defaultintroduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the 
defaultmid 1990s, HIV has changed from being a terminal illness to a long term manageable condition for most people. 
defaultHowever, 
defaultthere remains a 
defaultsubstantial
default need for care and support, particularly 
defaultfor those diagnosed late
default,
default those 
defaultwho acquired the virus before the 
defaultavailability of 
defaultHAART
default,
default those unable to manage their treatments or 
defaultthose with
default 
defaulta 
defaultmore complex set of social and health problems. In addition, 
defaultpeople with HIV are typically challenged by 
defaultsignificant levels of stigma 
defaultand 
defaultun
defaultcertainty about their prognosis.
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default              
defaultThere have been a number of 
defaultdevelopments 
defaultin recent years
default which present new challenges for the long term support and care of people with HIV in the UK. These include:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultTreating people outside of hospitaldefault&#xa0;
default3.1
default              
defaultGiven the rising number of people living with HIV, there is a need to review how HIV treatment is delivered, as there will eventually be insufficient capacity within the existing services structure. Pressure on specialist services is further exacerbated because GPs often refer patients with HIV to their HIV clinic for non-HIV related health problems. 
defaultThis is due to a lack of knowledge and understanding among many GPs. 
defaultThis is unnecessarily costly and can also deny people with HIV the access to GP expertise.
default 
defaultCare for people with HIV must therefore be included in training
default and guidance
default for new and existing primary care staff.
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default              
defaultRoutine aspects of HIV care could also be delivered in primary care settings away from specialist centres. This would increase capacity in specialist services, create savings for the NHS and bring care closer to the patient. There are currently around 33 specialist HIV treatment providers in London alone. A movement towards greater primary care involvement in HIV care would also allow for the development of centres of excellence which could concentrate on highly specialist and in-patient HIV care and could be fewer in number.
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultTerrence Higgins Trust is innovating to provide more care for people living with HIV in their homes and communities. We are running a pilot project called One Clinic in London, which provides nurse-led HIV care in GP practices. One Clinic is a two-year project which provides HIV care for those patients 
defaulton treatment 
defaultwhose condition is stable
default and have
default an undetectable viral load. Patients can have their medication prescribed and their bloods monitored by a nurse in a GP clinic at more convenient times and locations for them, and avoiding the costs of hospital-based services, which are freed up to support patients with more complex needs. The 
defaultNHS
default 
defaultcould do more to
default support
default 
defaultthis model of care for people with HIV and other long term conditions.
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default              
defaultT
defaulthe Government 
defaultcould
default also 
defaultsupport national initiatives that use the knowledge and support that can be provided between patients with particular conditions.
default Terrence Higgins Trust’s
default innovative 
defaultLife
defaultPlus
default 
defaultservice
default, which has been funded by the Elton John AIDS Foundation,
default helps people living with HIV to manage their condition and reduces healthcare costs. 
defaultI
defaultt is a model that central government could support for various conditions as a low-cost way of improving long term condition management. 
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default              
defaultThe main components of the
default 
defaultLife
defaultPlus
default service include:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default              
defaultHealth Trainers offer support and information in areas that clients or clinic staff have identified. Health Trainers can support making sense of a diagnosis, managing side effects, sex and relationships, understanding medication, how to get the best out of talking to medical staff as well as diet and nutrition. Support can be accessed over the ph
defaultone or by email.
default&#xa0;
default3.7
default              
defaultIn two years, 
defaultMyHIV became
default the largest national network of people with HIV. 10 per cent of people accessing HIV care 
defaultalready 
defaultuse the service and support each other via MyHIV. Users report high levels of satisfaction, with 88 per cent stating that they are now better able to manage their HIV and 93 per cent reporting better knowledge of HIV thanks to the service.
defaultThe readiness of existing servicesdefault&#xa0;
default4.1
default              
defaultR
defaultesearch into the experiences of people living with HIV when using health and social care services has uncovered a number of concerns, particularly in relation to knowledge of HIV and in some cases discriminatory practices among
default 
defaultsocial care workers, GPs and other healthcare professionals.
default As the number of people living with HIV continues to rise, it is increasingly important that these problems are addressed.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultUK r
defaultesearch 
defaultsuggests that people 
defaultwith HIV most commonly experience discrimination 
defaultwhen accessing public services
default, with health and dental services being a particular area of concern.
default 
defaultA 2008 survey of people with HIV in London found that one third of people encountered discrimination because of their HIV status. Of those reporting discrimination, half said it had come from a healthcare worker: 26% from a dentist, 18% from a 
defaultGP and 10% from hospital staff
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default              
defaultUntil 2010, funding for HIV social care was protected by the ring
default-
defaultfenced AIDS Support Grant (ASG). The removal of this ring
default-
defaultfence in 2010/11 has already led to defunding of HIV social care, and this is worsening as Local Authorities’ budgets 
defaultcome under increasing pressure.
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default              
defaultAs with healthcare, social care for people with HIV has traditionally been delivered through specialist services. As HIV has turned into a long-term condition, there is now a gradual withdrawal of these specialist services. However, mainstream social care services have not adapted to cater for the needs of people with HIV. It is again imperative that mainstream social care staff gain basic HIV awareness to be able to meet the needs of those service users. THT has experience of many situations where the current lack of training has caused discrimination against people with HIV from social care staff. People over fifty living with HIV also express concern that social care staff will lack the necessary knowledge of HIV to support them in old age.
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.5
default              
defaultGiven that the public sector comprises some of the UK’s largest employers, it 
defaultholds considerable potential 
defaultnot only
default to
default improve the delivery of services t
defaulto people living with HIV, but 
defaultalso
default to
default increase HIV awareness and tackle discrimination. A great deal more could be done within the health service in particular in terms of training staff on HIV related stigma. Many health sector employees already receive HIV training from a health and safety perspective – but this does not look at the issue in the round and in some ways could be seen to exacerbate stigma by reducing HIV to an occupational hazard concern and thereby dehumanising the issue in the process.
default 
defaultWe would welcome a Government initiative,
default 
defaultworking in partnership with people living with HIV and representative agencies, to develop a robust campaign to challenge HIV stigma and increase awareness in public services.
default&#xa0;
default4.6
default              
defaultInvesting in strong self management programmes can also improve the situation by supporting people to be more confident and visible around their HIV status and assisting disclosure in key settings.
default 
defaultThe Equality Act (2010) gives people living with HIV some means of redress. However, taking legal action after discrimination has occurred is an arduous and potentially costly exercise. Reductions to the legal aid budget have reduced the capability for people living with HIV to take action against service providers, and this in turn devalues equalities legislation.
default&#xa0;
defaultAgeingdefault&#xa0;default5.1
default              
defaultTerrence Higgins Trust’s 
default50 Plus
default national study of people ageing with HIV
default discovered a range of particular challenges faced by people over 50 with HIV, including
default 
defaultphysical, mental, financial and social problems.
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default              
defaultCompared with their peers, older people with HIV have twice as many other long-term health conditions. Only a third from our study reported they had no other long-term conditions, 
defaultwhich contrasts sharply with the 57% of adults aged 45–74 in Great Britain who had none (Office for National Statistics, 2010). The most common conditions were high blood pressure, arthritis and neurological conditions. Heart disease and diabetes were also common. These conditions are associated with both the long-term effects of HIV treatment as well as ageing
default in general
default.
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default              
defaultAgain, many 
defaultr
defaulte
defaultspondents to the study
default expressed anxiety about needing to use home care or residential care because of perceived, and sometimes experienced, prejudice and ignorance about HIV within these services. Providers of social care services to older people need to train their staff and define good practice in management of clients with HIV, while funders should ensure this is included amongst quality measures. Personalised care budgets could, again, drive change if older people used their purchasing power to choose HIV and gay-friendly providers.
default&#xa0;
defaultMental healthdefault&#xa0;
default6.1
default              
defaultAccording to 
defaulta 
defaultrecent study
default of over 2,000 people with HIV in UK, one in four had clinical depression. Unemployment, poverty and lack of a support system of friends and relatives are strongly associated with depressive symptoms. Perhaps unsurprisingly, patients with depression were less likely to be adherent and to have an undetectable viral load than other people in the study. Depression and other mental health issues have been linked to HIV treatment problems before but this is the first study to look specifically at the situation in the UK.
default&#xa0;
default6.2
default              
default27
default% of respondents had a depressive disorder from t
defaulthe responses. Moreover, for 19
default% of respondents this was a major depressive disorder. 
default15
default% of employed people 
defaulthad symptoms, whereas 43
default% of 
defaultthose who were unemployed and 53
default% of those unable to work due to sickness or disability had symptoms. Those with enough money 
defaultto cover basic needs reached 13
default% with depressive symptoms, but among those who said they only s
defaultometimes had enough money, 43
default% had symptoms. Those who could never cove
defaultr their basic needs reached 53
default% with depression. There was also a clear relationship between degrees of social support and depressive symptoms.
default&#xa0;
default6.3
default              
defaultThe researchers also found an association between depressive symptoms and poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Among those saying that they had missed no drug do
defaultses over the past two weeks, 24
default% 
defaulthad depression. Among those 
defaultwh
defaulto missed three or more doses, 42% were depressed. 
defaultIncreasing depression severity scores were associated with higher rates of detectable virus.
default&#xa0;
default6.4
default              
defaultIt is therefore important that psychological support is better prioritised as part of care for people living with HIV. It is equally necessary to address other underlying causes of mental ill health by providing social support and advocacy to address problems related to immigration, poverty, employment and discrimination.
default 
defaultThe complexity of issues faced by some minority groups affected by HIV, for example those caught up in or exiting the asylum system, requires a particularly coordinated approach. Services including welfare rights advice, employment support and immigration advocacy have been commissioned in the past by PCTs.
default As commissioning of HIV treatment and care has become the responsibility of NHS England, t
defaulthere is no clear home for these services within current commissioning arrangements and we are anxious that many will be lost and vulnerable people living with HIV will lose important sources of support, leading to a damaging impact on their mental and physical health.
