"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by ITS United Kingdom (GSH0002)&#xa0;1.0\n              \n Introduction\n \n&#xa0;\n1.\n1\n  In compiling this response, we have assumed that it will be regarded as an external\n, \npartial\n view of internal Government and Civil Service processes.  The people best placed to give detailed answers to the questions in your inquiry are Ministers and civil servants.\n&#xa0;\n1.\n2\n  The remit of ITS (UK) \n(see paragraph 8.1) \nmeans that our knowledge of\n Government horizon scanning activities is limited to the transport sector and\n mainly\n to the activities of DfT, BIS and the Highways Agency.  Within these limitations, our experience is considerable, with Members reporting involvement with Government horiz\non scanning activities covering the last thirty years or so. \n Please bear in mind that some Government bodies use the term “Intelligent Mobility” for what we call “Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS)”.\n&#xa0;\n1.3  We would like to make the general point that the\n outputs from state-funded horizon scanning work should be made available to the public to read within a sensible time frame, unless publication carries evident risks in areas such as defence or security.  A risk of negative publicity for Government is not\n a valid reason for not publishing.\n  It would not be surprising if the lack of openness about horizon scanning results in responses to this inquiry being unduly negative\n or incompletely informed\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.4  Making the results of horizon scanning available to in\nterested parties as a matter of routine will also help mitigate the effects of the Civil Service career structure on the longevity of this work.  Private sector professionals tend to stay in their profession, and once aware of a study will keep referring t\no it, keeping the knowledge alive.  Civil servants move from topic to topic in their careers, and “reading up” on the previous ten years of departmental research activity in their new area of work does not seem to be part of their induction into new posts.\n1.\n5\n  DfT is commissioning infrastructure projects for fifty years ahead – such as HS2 – and better communication of the horizon scanning would probably ease the stakeholder engagement required for those projects.\n&#xa0;\n2\n.0  \nHow do Government departments make \nuse of horizon scanning?\n&#xa0;\n2.1  \nMembers \nwho have had \ninvolvement with \nhorizon scanning studies \nsuggest\n that Government \ncan be\n reluctant to work at the \nhorizon because \nby definition such work will lack credible detail such as exact costs and timing.  It is ha\nbitually ridiculed in the UK media which makes it unattractive to politicians and th\nerefore to th\nose who work for them.  \nThe horizon scanning is too often not \nlocked in to internal strategic thinking and option \nanalysis.  It follows that some \nwork which is\n passed off as \nhorizon scanning is actually looking at new technologies and societal tre\nnds which are already present, or in other words \nmuch nearer than the\n horizon at the time of the study\n (and therefore a safer subject)\n.  There seems to be a lack of acceptance that the conclusions of genuine horizon scanning work will sometimes turn out to be completely wrong, but that this is not a reason not to do it, or evidence of lack of competence by its authors.  \n \nIt might well be\n the case that the completion of a scanning exercise has in itself delivered new knowledge or that the use of back-casting (working backwards from a future scenario to determine what would be the early signs of an unwelcome trend) has reinforced planning a\nnd strategic thinking more widely.\n&#xa0;\n2.2  \nOne example is the \nCyber Trust \nwork done in 2003 on scenari\nos \nfor \n2018.   \nAt the time, some of the conclusions were welcomed, but there was also criticism of perceived s\ncaremongering\n.  However, two of these predicti\nons came true some time ago:  \npervasive computing has arrived; \nand \nthe Chinese Government \napproach to IT \nsecurity \nmirrors the predictions in the report.\n&#xa0;\n2.3  \nAnother is the Foresight 2005 look at \nIntelligent Infrastructure scenarios \nfor \n50 years\n hence.  This work was ambitious and detailed, and respectfully received by the \ntransport\n community at least, but it appears to have had little \nlasting \nimpact on \nsubsequent \npolicy\n.  \n&#xa0;\n2.4  \nA fourth example is the road mapping for transport policy undertake\nn by the Transport KTN and the Automotive Council, both organisations set up by BIS.  Industry has had a lot of involvement in this work.  Other Government departments do not appear to be making use of this resource\n \n– or to be involved in the work – even t\nhough for instance DfT is far more concerned with transport policy than BIS.  The Day Review proposals for better cross-Department coordination are necessary and we welcome them.\n&#xa0;\n3.0  \nHow effective is horizon scanning in Government? Do Ministers and \nsenior officials consider horizon scanning outputs appropriately\n?\n&#xa0;\n3.1  \nSee also response to Q1.  \n&#xa0;\n3.2  \nThere is a common failing within Departments in that the lack of scientific or \nengineering literacy among many senior policy makers means that the significance of actual or potential technology developments is not recognised or, when brought to their attention, not understood.  \nThi\ns\n is as likely to be due to the findings not being pr\nesented in a suitable format, as to the recipient not having the knowledge to understand them.  \nThe proposed changes to the Horizon Scanning governance will not do anything to address these points.\n&#xa0;\n3.3  \nWhen horizon sc\nanning is undertaken, there can be \na \ndisconnect between the outputs of \nthe study \nand what action is taken next. This may be because\n t\nhe costs, benefits and risks are difficult to quantify so it \nis \neasier to ignore \nthe study, and possible to ignore it unless it was undertaken as a result of a \nstrong political imperative\n.\n   Taking this option  is unfortunately not preceded by quantifying the risks of ignoring the \nstudy as well as quantifying the risks of acting on it.  \nGovernment\n need\ns\n to consider how to quantify these risks accurately.  \nTaking \nthe short term approach needs to be designed out of the process.  \n&#xa0;\n4.0  \nWhat changes could be made to improve existing horizon scanning activity? Will the recommendations made in Jon Day’s review of cross-government horizon scanning capability address cur\nrent shortcomings? \nWhat progress has been made implementing these?\n&#xa0;\n4.1  \nPeople who have been involved in Foresight reviews (very similar, but not identical, to Horizon Scanning) have noted the additional vigour regarding follow-up and regular post hoc \nmonitoring when a Minister has been involved as Principal Client.  There has been very uneven practice regarding publicity and the opportunity for open debate on studies and their findings\n.  T\nhe allegation that for many studies\n \nthe analytic community has e\nnjoyed the chase rather than the capture is probably correct.\n&#xa0;\n5.0  How effective is the Government at responding \nto policy or regulatory challeng\nes presented by new technologies?\n&#xa0;\n5.1  \nSee also response to Q1\n at paragraph 3.2\n  \n&#xa0;\n5.2  \nGovernment has \nsometimes\n been too slow and too private\n,\n not least because Chief Scientific Advisers are only loosely tied in to top level strategy and planning in many Departments. \nAs a general point Departments have too \nfew external advisory bodies – relatively informal\n bodies operating at about Deputy Director level to discuss technology movements, industry  trends, what scientific developments might mature into engineering products or processes etc and thus acting as the very early detectors of issues where a more stru\nctured approach would be justified.  \n&#xa0;\n5.3  \nThere are particular problems in transport where the fact that delivery rests with Local Authorities and Industry has been seen as a reason to justify too much inactivity regarding tactical technology \nthinking.\n  \nThe reduction in research carried out by DfT and the HA in the area of transport technology leads to Local Authorities trying to cope with a hands-off, localism agenda with less support from the centre and less internal resources.  This combination of \ncirc\numstances, unless addressed,  will lead to the UK being able to benefit less from new transport technology in the future.\n&#xa0;\n5.4  \nWith particular regard to DfT, maybe it is \nunique in having a remit over an arena with such a mix of government money, \nregulation and private money\n.  \n Where else does something driven by global market development and paid for by the user – the car – interact with publicly funded infrastructure? That does mak\ne it particularly challenging.  \nBut \nit \nalso raises the importance \nof getting it right. \n&#xa0;\n5.5  \nA linked point \nis that\n in other policy areas, the horizon scanning and policy proposals seem to come from think tanks\n and similar bodies\n. \nT\no some extent that happens \nalso in transport with, for example, the RAC F\noundation. But \nthe transport policy area seems poorly served compared to some other policy areas\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.0  Case study:  \nautonomous road vehicles and intelligent transport infrastructure:\n&#xa0;\nWhat are (or were) the policy challenges presented by this technology? How have these \nchallenges been identified?\n&#xa0;\n6.1\n  As an example, the Cooperative Vehicle Highways Systems study undertaken by AECOM for DfT \naround the middle of the last decade \noutlined these clearly \nbut the recommendations for research monitoring were not carried out. Following \nthe \ndeparture of \nthe \nDfT staff \nwho were the clients for the study, there was \nlittle \nevidence of the matter receiving further consideration\n for several years\n.  Contact with the ITS (UK) CVHS Interest Group, which had been important in keeping DfT staff up to date with international developments, was also \nseverely reduced.  \n(See also paragraph 1.4)\n&#xa0;\n6.2  \nDfT have very recently engaged again,\n with plans to commi\nssion consultancy work on automated platooning of vehicles and undertake trials.  \nHowever, the disconnect between these pieces of work shows a lack of continuity of foresight and planning.\n \nThe recent UK work on \nautonomous vehicles, \nsuch as\n the IET publishing a case study and the \nEPSRC supporting\n the Oxford robotic car work led by Professor Paul Newman\n, is not \nobviously linked to DfT and the study it commissioned (see para 6.1).\n&#xa0;\nH\now prepared is (or was) the Government to react to challenges\n presented by this technology? How effective was this reaction?\n&#xa0;\n6.3\n  \nThe plan for watching the horizon was there (with triggers that showed the changes were coming) along with a plan to react but the work seemed to be on a shelf rather than used by DfT. When information \nis\n required now \nit is \ngiven on a voluntary basis via I\nTS \n(\nUK\n), which we are very happy to do, but \n \nsince DfT paid for the study it is wasteful not to refer to it.\n&#xa0;\n6.4\n  \nThe UK activity can be contrasted with the Dutch Government which also employed horizon scanning in the area of cooperative systems, but then\n demonstrated a continuous interest and commitment to ensuring the Netherlands remained at the forefront of this development.  See \nhttp://www.cvisproject.org/en/news/spits_the_strategic_platform_for_intelligent_traffic_systems.htm\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7\n.0  Summary\n&#xa0;\n7\n.1  \nThe basic premise seems to \nbe that there is a lack of horizon scanning capability in the Civil Service, whose role is “…to meet both the challenges of the day and be mindful of the longer term.  It is a Civil Service responsibility to\n look beyond the parliamentary t\nerm and so day to\n day issues and short term politics should not drive the horizon scanning agenda”.  But successful policy analysis and thinking demands two additional inputs:  Ministers and their Special Advisers, and Industry especially the \nindustries that supply product\ns and services to deliver Government policies and targets (Health, Transport, Defence, for example).\nThis report and the incorporated recommendations ignore these elements and the interpretation of senior customers as confined to Permanent Secretaries \net a\nl\n is too narrow.\n&#xa0;\n8.0  About ITS United Kingdom \n&#xa0;\n8.1\n              \n ITS United Kingdom, referred to \nin this document\n as ITS (UK), is a ‘not-for-profit’ public/private sector association financed by members' subscriptions providing a forum for all organisations concerned with ITS.  The Society works to bring the advantages that ITS can offer in terms of economic efficien\ncy, transport safety, and environmental benefits to the United Kingdom.  The Membership of over 150 UK organisations comprises Government Departments, Local Authorities, Police Forces, consultancies, manufacturing and service companies, and academic and re\nsearch institutions.  ITS United Kingdom encourages discussion on issues such as public/private co-operation, standards, legislation, information provision and new technology.  ITS (UK) was a key contributor to the Parliamentary POSTNote 322 ‘Intelligent T\nransport Systems’ published in January 2009.  \n&#xa0;\n8.2\n  Intelligent Transport Systems, “ITS”, is the term used to describe combinations of sensors, telecoms, information processing and location referencing to deliver improved transport systems and services in\ncluding information before and during a trip for travellers by all modes.  Some examples: ITS can improve the efficiency of transport through traffic control and enforcement of traffic regulations and enhance road safety through in-vehicle systems for coll\nision avoidance and better lane keeping.  Many commercial organisations use ITS to manage vehicle fleets, both freight and passenger, through the provision of real-time information and two way communication between manager and driver.  Electronic ticketing\n (by means of Smartcards, for example) enables faster, easier travel by public transport.  In addition Intelligent Transport Systems have beneficial effects on the environment by reducing air and noise pollution on highways and by helping to create traffic\n free zones in cities.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\nAppendix – Members of ITS United Kingdom&#xa0;\nAECOM\nAmey Infrastructure Services\nAtkins Transport Systems\nAtos\nCapita Symonds\nCubic Transportation\nDept for \nBusiness\n&#xa0;\nInnovation &amp;\n&#xa0;\nSkills\nDept  for Regional Dev.\nDept for Transport\nEC Harris \nLLP\nEGIS SA\nEssex County Council\nGlasgow City Council\nHighways Agency\nHogia\nIBI Group\nIBM South Bank\nJacobs\n U.K. Ltd\nKapsch TrafficCom\nMIRA Ltd\nMott MacDonald Ltd\nMouchel \nNicander Ltd\nPA Consulting\nRedSpeed International\nRingway\nScottish Enterprise\nSerco \nLtd\nTAN (Transport Associates Network)\nTechnolution B.V.\nThales \nTransport for London\nTransport Scotland\nTRL Ltd\nUniversity of Southampton\nURS Limited\nWelsh Government\nXerox\n3M United Kingdom (Formerly PIPS Technology Ltd)\n4way Consulting\nAA DriveTech\nACTIV8\nAGD Systems Ltd\nAGES International\nAnkerbold International Ltd\nAPT Controls Group\nArup, Ove Arup &amp;
