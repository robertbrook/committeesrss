defaultis concerned that any such development should be properly

defaultUK trunk road 
defaultnetwork. 
defaultThe Chamber and many of our partners have significant reservations about 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment’s current proposal 
defaultto impose tolls on the 
defaultA
default14 Huntingdon to 
defaultCambridge
default 
defaultroute
default, once improved
default, for the following reasons: 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn this instance 
defaultthe
default formal consultation process by the Highways Agency 
defaultw
defaultas badly conceiv
defaulted and poorly implemented
default. 
defaultSuffolk Chamber 
defaultof Commerce 
defaultand many of our partners have responded to the consultation, and written to the Chancellor, asking that 
defaultno decision 
defaultshould be taken 
defaulton tolling the A14, until the full economic impact has been properly assessed and considered by all those likely to be affec
defaultted, and 
defaulta satisfactory response has been given 
defaultto 
defaultour
default very real concerns that Government’s proposals for tolling will act as an arbitrary and unfair tax on Suffolk businesses.
defaultWe 
defaulttherefore 
defaultrecommend that the 
defaultTransport 
defaultCommittee should aim to ensure that, 
defaultwhatever mechanisms are identified for Government to increase investment in strategic roads and attract new investors, the needs of business and the economy are not disregarded as they have
default so far
default been in th
defaulte
default case
default of tolling the A14
default. T
defaulthe Highways Agency 
defaultsh
defaultould be
default steered in future to work with the grain of business
default, and in the interests of UK plc,
default rather than against it.
defaultHow should the Highways Agency be reformeddefault&#xa0;defaultto make it “the world’s leading highway operator”? What roles should Government and the privatedefault sector play to ensure better management of the strategic road network?defaultSuffolk Chamber of Commerce 
defaulthas concerns 
defaultabout the Highways Agency
default’s current culture and performance which
default arise from the fact that it is remote and disconnected from businesses and lo
defaultcal communities with regard to planning and managing the strategic road network.
defaultAlthough we believe that the 
defaultAgency needs strong management and 
defaultperhaps
default greater independence from Government
default, and 
defaultmore involvement by private finance
default, some of the Chamber’s re
defaultcent experiences suggest that unless the Agency achieves major cultural change in respect of its relationship with the private sector then it will continue to fail to capture the latent benefits of private sector partnership working
defaultTwo recent examples ill
defaultustrate this point. 
defaultFirst, the Agency recently 
defaultdrew together
default a group of strategic partners in connection with a number of challenges around the A14 and,
default not least, the congestion that 
defaultfrequently 
defaultoccurs on or close to the Orwell crossing just outside 
defaultIpswich
default. The Agency convened a summit with MPs and senior representatives from the local authorities but made no attempt to reach the Chamber or any other business voice organisations. An opportunity was lost to secure the input from some of the major user
defaults of the A14 which links the 
defaultPort
default of 
defaultFelixstowe
default to the Midlands and therefore acts as an economic driver for 
defaultSuffolk
default, 
defaultEast Anglia
default and indeed UK plc.
defaultSecond, the Agency 
defaulthas very recently
default consult
defaulted
default on proposed improvements to the A14 between Huntingdon and 
defaultC
defaultambridge
default and on proposals to toll the new route. 
defaultSuffolk Chamber 
defaultof Commerce 
defaultsupport
defaults the
default improvements 
defaultbut at the same time has strong
default concerns
default 
defaultat Government proposals to partly fund those improvements through tolling.
defaultThe
default public consultation exercise, led
default for Government by the Highways Agency and regarding the proposed improvements and tolling arrangements, was launched on 9 September 
defaultand c
defaultonclude
defaultd
default on 13 October 2013.
defaultThe Chamber
default’s concerns 
defaultabout the consultation process 
defaultare based on a number of specific c
defaultircumstances which again illustrate the Agency’s disconnectedness from businesses and communities
default. In particular:
defaultAll of this suggest
defaulted
default to us that Government 
defaultthrough the Agency had
default already concluded that the 
defaultimprovements and proposed tolling are not a major issue
default for business
default in 
defaultSuffolk
default and other counties outside Cambridgeshire. This is not correct of course and seems to us to sit uncomfortably with Government’s wish to secure a wide base of financial contribu
defaulttions towards the project, both up-front from local partners and in the longer term through tolling.
defaultWhatever structural changes are made the Highways Agency will not become 
default“the world’s leading highway operator”
default unless it works collaboratively and positiv
defaultely with businesses and local communities.
