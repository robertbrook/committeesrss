[normal]Written evidence from [bold]Suffolk Chamber Of Commerce[bold] (SRN 011)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]How will the policies set out in the Government’s “Action for Roads” command paper improve the strategic road network for all road [bold]users, whilst also improving the environment?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]By securing greater longer term funding certainty which should enable the strategic road programme to be developed without the risk of delays and postponements. 
[normal]Any n
[normal]ew structure for the Highways Agency 
[normal]must
[normal] enable it to focus more on key delivery areas and develop stronger links with stakeholders
[normal] and especially businesses.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]How does the Government’s policy for roads link with planning for other transport modes?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]In the absence of a 
[normal]National Policy Statement
[normal] for road and rail
[normal] t
[normal]his remains uncertain. It is important that the contribution that rail and coastal shipping can make to reducing traffic by road is properly factored into strategic road planning
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]How reliable is the Government’s forecast for growth in[bold] demand for the strategic road   network? How should the Government deal with uncertainty in its forecast? [bold]&#xa0;[bold]No comments
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]How can we improve the reliability and efficiency of travel on the strategic road network? What impact will new technology have?[bold]No 
[normal]comments
[normal]What mechanisms are there for Government to increase investment in strategic roads and attract new investors? Are there good examples from other countries that could be applied in the [bold]UK[bold]? [bold]Network wide road tolling 
[normal]might in future 
[normal]offer important 
[normal]opportunities t
[normal]o attract private investment in support of the development of the strategic road network.
[normal]Nonetheless Suffolk Chamber 
[normal]of Commerce 
[normal]is concerned that any such development should be properly 
[normal]thought through and consulted on and managed in a way that is equitable to all road users across the 
[normal]UK trunk road 
[normal]network. 
[normal]The Chamber and many of our partners have significant reservations about 
[normal]the 
[normal]Government’s current proposal 
[normal]to impose tolls on the 
[normal]A
[normal]14 Huntingdon to 
[normal]Cambridge
[normal] 
[normal]route
[normal], once improved
[normal], for the following reasons: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In this instance 
[normal]the
[normal] formal consultation process by the Highways Agency 
[normal]w
[normal]as badly conceiv
[normal]ed and poorly implemented
[normal]. 
[normal]Suffolk Chamber 
[normal]of Commerce 
[normal]and many of our partners have responded to the consultation, and written to the Chancellor, asking that 
[normal]no decision 
[normal]should be taken 
[normal]on tolling the A14, until the full economic impact has been properly assessed and considered by all those likely to be affec
[normal]ted, and 
[normal]a satisfactory response has been given 
[normal]to 
[normal]our
[normal] very real concerns that Government’s proposals for tolling will act as an arbitrary and unfair tax on Suffolk businesses.
[normal]We 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]recommend that the 
[normal]Transport 
[normal]Committee should aim to ensure that, 
[normal]whatever mechanisms are identified for Government to increase investment in strategic roads and attract new investors, the needs of business and the economy are not disregarded as they have
[normal] so far
[normal] been in th
[normal]e
[normal] case
[normal] of tolling the A14
[normal]. T
[normal]he Highways Agency 
[normal]sh
[normal]ould be
[normal] steered in future to work with the grain of business
[normal], and in the interests of UK plc,
[normal] rather than against it.
[normal]How should the Highways Agency be reformed[bold]&#xa0;[bold]to make it “the world’s leading highway operator”? What roles should Government and the private[bold] sector play to ensure better management of the strategic road network?[bold]Suffolk Chamber of Commerce 
[normal]has concerns 
[normal]about the Highways Agency
[normal]’s current culture and performance which
[normal] arise from the fact that it is remote and disconnected from businesses and lo
[normal]cal communities with regard to planning and managing the strategic road network.
[normal]Although we believe that the 
[normal]Agency needs strong management and 
[normal]perhaps
[normal] greater independence from Government
[normal], and 
[normal]more involvement by private finance
[normal], some of the Chamber’s re
[normal]cent experiences suggest that unless the Agency achieves major cultural change in respect of its relationship with the private sector then it will continue to fail to capture the latent benefits of private sector partnership working
[normal]Two recent examples ill
[normal]ustrate this point. 
[normal]First, the Agency recently 
[normal]drew together
[normal] a group of strategic partners in connection with a number of challenges around the A14 and,
[normal] not least, the congestion that 
[normal]frequently 
[normal]occurs on or close to the Orwell crossing just outside 
[normal]Ipswich
[normal]. The Agency convened a summit with MPs and senior representatives from the local authorities but made no attempt to reach the Chamber or any other business voice organisations. An opportunity was lost to secure the input from some of the major user
[normal]s of the A14 which links the 
[normal]Port
[normal] of 
[normal]Felixstowe
[normal] to the Midlands and therefore acts as an economic driver for 
[normal]Suffolk
[normal], 
[normal]East Anglia
[normal] and indeed UK plc.
[normal]Second, the Agency 
[normal]has very recently
[normal] consult
[normal]ed
[normal] on proposed improvements to the A14 between Huntingdon and 
[normal]C
[normal]ambridge
[normal] and on proposals to toll the new route. 
[normal]Suffolk Chamber 
[normal]of Commerce 
[normal]support
[normal]s the
[normal] improvements 
[normal]but at the same time has strong
[normal] concerns
[normal] 
[normal]at Government proposals to partly fund those improvements through tolling.
[normal]The
[normal] public consultation exercise, led
[normal] for Government by the Highways Agency and regarding the proposed improvements and tolling arrangements, was launched on 9 September 
[normal]and c
[normal]onclude
[normal]d
[normal] on 13 October 2013.
[normal]The Chamber
[normal]’s concerns 
[normal]about the consultation process 
[normal]are based on a number of specific c
[normal]ircumstances which again illustrate the Agency’s disconnectedness from businesses and communities
[normal]. In particular:
[normal]All of this suggest
[normal]ed
[normal] to us that Government 
[normal]through the Agency had
[normal] already concluded that the 
[normal]improvements and proposed tolling are not a major issue
[normal] for business
[normal] in 
[normal]Suffolk
[normal] and other counties outside Cambridgeshire. This is not correct of course and seems to us to sit uncomfortably with Government’s wish to secure a wide base of financial contribu
[normal]tions towards the project, both up-front from local partners and in the longer term through tolling.
[normal]Whatever structural changes are made the Highways Agency will not become 
[normal]“the world’s leading highway operator”
[normal] unless it works collaboratively and positiv
[normal]ely with businesses and local communities.
