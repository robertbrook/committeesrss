[[[About the UK Faculty of Public Health]]]&#xa0;The Faculty of Public Health (FPH) is the standard setting body for specialists in public health in the UK. FPH is the professional home for more than 3,300 professionals working in public health. Our members come from a range of professional backgrounds (including clinical, academic and policy) and are employed in a variety of settings, usually working at a strategic or specialist level. &#xa0;FPH is a joint faculty of the three Royal Colleges of Public Health Physicians of the United Kingdom (London, Edinburgh and Glasgow).Â  In addition, FPH advocates on key public health issues and provides practical information and guidance for public health professionals, aiming to advance the health of the population through three key areas of work: health promotion, health protection and healthcare improvement.&#xa0;
