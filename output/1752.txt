[[[Written evidence submitted by John Barry (WSC076)]]]Title: A leaky pipeline, or reasoned life choices?1/ Executive summaryThis memorandum addresses the question of why women are less represented than men at the top of the career ladder in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) areas, and what universities and the government might seek to do about this. The conclusion is that many women don’t continue STEM careers because they opt for other life choices. Therefore, universities and the government would be misguided to give preferential treatment to women in fields they have chosen not to develop careers in. 2/ About the authorI am a research co-ordinator working for University College London (UCL) in the Institute for Women’s Health. My work entails initiating and support research projects in the field of women’s health, mainly in the area of polycystic ovary syndrome. I am a chartered psychologist, and my MSc and PhD dissertations were on the subject of the psychological dimensions of polycystic ovary syndrome. I also tutor in research methods and statistics. 

[[[3/]]] My interest in positive action for women in STEM began shortly after I began my current position with UCL in Sept 2011. Having been a mature student, I was keen to ensure that my career had every chance of progressing in a timely fashion. I was therefore very interested to receive an email from UCL regarding career-enhancing opportunities being made available through a scheme called Athena Swan. However when I responded to the email I was told that I could not participate, because the scheme was for women only. Thus began my interest in the topic of the promotion of women in STEM. 4/ Declaration of interestsThe author is a man attempting to have a successful career in a STEM field. September 2013

[[[mmittee should be aware of]]]Q: Why do numbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder?&#xa0;About a year ago the University and College Union circulated a document called ‘The Chemistry PhD: the impact on women’s retention’ (RSC, 2008). It supposedly demonstrated how women are held back from careers in chemistry, and was given as an example of how women were held back in STEM careers in general. I read the document and was surprised that anyone could come to any other conclusion than that the women in the study didn’t want a career in chemistry because it simply wasn’t the kind of career they wanted to get into. The author of the study concluded that female PhD students more than male had “formed the impression the doctoral research process is an ordeal filled with frustration, pressure and stress, which a career in research would only prolong” (RSC 2008, p.7). The main reasons seemed to revolve around the theme that a career in chemistry was solitary, entailed long hours, stress, a competitive (“macho”) culture and was not conducive “with other aspects of their life, particularly relationships and family” (RSC 2008, p.7). Other research has found similar opinions amongst women regarding STEM careers (e.g. O’Driscoll and Anderson, 1994), yet these papers are presented as evidence that it is some kind of gender-based discriminated that holds these women back. Rather than supporting women’s choices, there are those in academia who appear oblivious to women’s choices.&#xa0;6/ Q: What role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers? In government too there is concern that women’s life choices are holding them back in the workplace. For example, MP Lynn Featherstone’s says: “I think that it [having a baby] is a bit of a setback to women because it gives an opportunity – whether it’s in commerce, politics or wherever you work – to men to climb the ladder faster. There is a period of a woman’s life – where she may need to take a break or work at a different rate. I have seen many mediocre men on the boards of directors…they get there because they had no [career] break along the way. And some get to the top because of who they knew.” (The Telegraph, 2012). Again, the focus appears to be on promoting women in the workplace rather than respecting women’s rights to a family life. Although the evidence for women being disadvantaged in regards STEM opportunities is limited, the evidence that children are disadvantaged by being left in inadequate daycare is much clearer (Todd et al, 2001)&#xa0;7/ Q: What should universities and the higher education sector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?One solution that has been widely adopted in universities in the UK is the Athena Swann Charter. This is scheme that aims to promote women in STEM fields through a wide variety of programmes e.g. training those in management to be aware of their own ‘unconscious bias’ in the hiring and promotion of women, special mentoring schemes for women, and access to career networks for women. The aim appears to be to have as many women as men in the top jobs in STEM, and anything short of this is an unacceptable gender inequality. The first principal of the Athena Swan charter is to “To address gender inequalities requires commitment and action from everyone, at all levels of the organisation” (Athena Swan Charter, 2012). In my opinion, the use of the term ‘gender inequalities’ is misused here because it carries with it connotations of sex discrimination; this is misplaced in a situation where the ‘inequality’ is based on women’s choice not to develop careers in a given field.8/ Should universities adopt the Athena Swann charter? Lesley Yellowlees the first female president of the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC). She is a supporter of the Athena Swan Charter, and said in an interview: “I’m not an advocate of positive discrimination…. “I want women to feel like they achieved what they’ve achieved on their own merit” (ACS, 2013). This raises the question of how the ‘leaky pipeline’ is repaired without resorting to positive discrimination. 9/ Although positive discrimination in the workplace is illegal in the UK, ‘positive action’ is perfectly legal. What is the difference between the two? The latter is deemed acceptable based on the proportionate principle: how serious the inequality is and how important the need is. However, proportionate action depends on the perception of the employer, which in turn depends on the evidence available to the employer. My concerns are that (1) many employers will make poor decisions about employment practices based on weak evidence, such as the RSC (2008) paper cited above, or based upon “discussion with employees or their representatives”, rather than sound evidence, as suggested in the government’s Equality Action note (Jarrett 2011, p.8), and (2) this will create a barrier to men to progress in the STEM workplace. Unlike Lynn Featherstone, I do not presume that many of the men in top jobs are ‘mediocre’, but people who have worked hard and who should not be systematically disadvantaged because of their sex.  10/ There are cases where there is a reasonable argument for that women having priority over men in filling certain jobs. This might be seen around issues of religion (e.g. where a woman prefers not to be seen by a male doctor) or sensitivity (e.g. personal care of elderly women). The same reasoning applies to corresponding jobs for men. However there is no reasonable argument for giving women preferential access to jobs or career development opportunities in cases where a man might just as easily do the job. The reality of the job market is that it is a zero-sum game: giving advantage to one person is to disadvantage another, and does not lead to equality.&#xa0;
