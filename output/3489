[normal]The Faculty of Public Health (FPH) is the standard setting body for specialists in public health in the UK. FPH is the professional home for more than 3,300 professionals working in public health. Our members come from a range of professional backgrounds (including clinical, academic and policy) and are employed in a variety of settings, usually working at a strategic or specialist level.
