&#xa0;Written evidence from the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners [PCC Progress 34]

[[[ ]]]&#xa0;1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC) is the national body which supports Police and Crime Commissioners (‘PCCs’) and other local policing bodies.  This document co-ordinates the views of PCCs in relation to the key areas listed in the terms of reference. The document is arranged in line with those key areas.  &#xa0;1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Oral evidence was given to the Home Affairs Select Committee by Sir Graham Bright, Tony Lloyd and Ron Ball on the 26th November 2013.&#xa0;1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; PCCs can maintain and increase public confidence in policing. PCCs are working hard to ensure local communities have a stronger voice in policing. Working with Chief Constables PCCS are transforming the way forces interact with the public so that policing in the 21st century is more responsive to communities’ concerns about crime.

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC) is a company limited by guarantee. The APCC services are overseen and directed by PCCs. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A key role for PCCs is to ensure that the public and victims have a stronger voice in policing. PCCs’ policing and crime plans demonstrate how they are doing this, by putting local community and victims needs at the heart of their vision. As a result of consultation policing and crime plans reflect the views and interests of the communities they represent.3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Keeping crime low is central to public confidence in policing and PCCs remain vigilant about reducing crime and holding their forces to account to ensure this happens in practice. However, it’s important to note that reducing crime isn’t about the police alone.&#xa0;3.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Over the next year PCCs will be taking on much wider responsibilities for local criminal justice matters, i.e. wider commissioning of services.  This will play an increasingly important role in how PCCs reduce crime and deliver an effective criminal justice service, including policing.&#xa0;3.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Crime has continued to fall since PCCs came into office, down 5-7% on the previous year and is now at record low levels with a national decline in reduction of violent crime. There is some evidence of a nascent increase in some forms of crime, for example shoplifting and theft from the person. There is also an increase in sexual offences in some areas although this has been attributed to a rise in reporting historic crimes. It’s important to note that a comparison of pre-PCC and post-PCC crime statistics will not be available until early 2014.3.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Although it is still early in the piece to judge overall effectiveness there are already plenty of examples of PCCs, both individually and collectively, demonstrating their ability to effect positive change in reducing crime and delivering an effective police service.&#xa0;3.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The following provides a snapshot of initiatives introduced by PCCS to reduce crime and deliver a more effective police service:&#xa0;Victims of Crime:

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; While there have been some local issues, the vast majority of PCCs and Chief Constables have constructive and robust relationships as characterized by oral evidence given to the Committee by both PCCs and Chief Constables. While there is a clear line of accountability from chief constables to directly elected PCCs this does not cut across their operational independence.&#xa0;4.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Policing Protocol Order 2011 states:&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The role of PCCs in holding chief constables to account is characterized by transparency and rigour. A good example is Cambridgeshire which holds a Business Co-ordination Board (BCB), a monthly meeting between the Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner, ACPO rank officers and senior officers of the OPCC. This is a forum in which current and future business is discussed between the senior leaders of the two bodies, focussing on issues relating to strategy, governance, business and holding the Chief Constable to account. It is one forum in which decisions can be made by the Commissioner, informed by the decision making policy. Minutes of the meeting and key papers are published on the Commissioner’s website.&#xa0;4.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Surrey PCC has instituted live webcasts of bi-monthly management meetings so that the public can see how he is holding the Chief Constable to account and the progress that is being made.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The role of the Police and Crime Panel is to scrutinise the PCC in the delivery of their functions whereas it is the role of the electorate to hold the PCC to account. &#xa0;5.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The powers of the Panel are set out in legislation; the legislation does not provide for any other forum for scrutiny.  It is for Parliament to consider any change to those powers. PCCs will of course have an interest but respect the Panel’s independent and distinct role in scrutinising PCCs. Indeed PCCs remain committed to PCPs taking full advantage of their existing powers. &#xa0;5.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Police and Crime Panels have only been operational for one year and there are indications of growing engagement between PCCs and Panels. The relationships between Panels and PCCs are maturing, and there are areas of effective discussions around difficult issues of budgeting and the precept. PCCS believe that the relationship with the Panel is an important one and value the potential for a “candid friend” in the development of policy.&#xa0;5.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Greater Manchester provides a good example of a PCP making use of its powers of scrutiny through an effective panel comprising 10 local authority leaders. The work of the panel is underpinned by a police and crime steering group which has been able to work jointly with police on achieving consensus where there have previously been diverging views.&#xa0;5.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There should be recognition that the change from the Police Authority system took place very swiftly, with limited transitional planning, mid-financial year, making conversations, particularly those about budget-making decisions, challenging for both PCCs and Panels.&#xa0;5.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In conclusion PCCS believe that PCPS are well placed to scrutinise the delivery of their functions and that as they mature they are increasingly making full use of their existing powers.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The underlying intention of Stage 2 is that operational staff under the control and direction of Chief Constables will pass to their employment. PCCs retain responsibility for the budget and holding forces to account. &#xa0;6.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; No one force’s Stage 2 plan is exactly the same as another.  There are variations in what each PCC proposes, with some keeping a larger number of staff than others and some keeping functions which others are not.  PCCs and chief constables are deciding locally what is best for their forces, ultimately to reduce crime and deliver an effective police service.&#xa0;6.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Although all Stage 2 plans are different it is possible to say that most plans will see the majority of police staff transferring to the employment of the Chief Constable, whilst the PCC will continue to employ a small body of support staff to help run their offices and support them in their oversight and scrutiny functions. &#xa0;6.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; All plans are still subject to the approval of the Home Secretary and we expect confirmation of plans from December, in time for implementation in April 2014.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Commissioners have maintained progress on working with chief constables to bring down the cost of policing in line with the government's targets, without so far a significant adverse impact on performance and crime levels. This has been achieved through efficiency and capacity enhancements, reductions in bureaucracy, and more robust scrutiny and challenge. But it would be wrong to suggest that austerity has not posed a significant challenge for leaders of the police service.&#xa0;7.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It should be noted that HMIC has identified an increased number of forces where further reductions may risk services delivered to the public.&#xa0;7.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; While significant success has been achieved through collaboration, better procurement, and more efficient use of staff resources, looking ahead, substantial further grant reductions are likely. The scope to cut costs is not infinite, and Commissioners need the government to work with them to consider the long term configuration of services and resourcing levels which will ensure that services remain sustainable. There is also a need to consider better approaches to the management of demands for policing and community services.&#xa0;7.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In year 1, the vast majority of Commissioners have set precepts which have been at or below the government's threshold. While recognising the need to control local taxation levels, PCCs were elected on the basis of clear statements about local plans and priorities. There is a powerful case for arguing that the stringent controls on precept increases should be relaxed where the increase is linked to delivering additional services requested by communities. &#xa0;7.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Ultimately, PCCs are responsible for the safety of their communities. As the austerity agenda continues, there may come a point in some areas where the Force is unable to sustain current levels of services and expectations within the resources available from grant and the target level of Council Tax.  PCCs will be monitoring performance locally, and this could trigger the need for increases in Council Tax above the threshold.&#xa0;7.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Should any Commissioner wish to raise the precept above the stated threshold they would need licence from their communities (via a referendum) and they would need to consider the cost implications of such a course of action.&#xa0;7.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A number of Commissioners have cited concerns about further impacts on their budgets:&#xa0;&#xa0;7.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Commissioners can only deliver through others. In the case of the chief, the PCC can set targets and hold the Force to account. It is not the same with other partners who, by their own actions, can impact on Policing resources. A prime example is in relation to Health, where changes to the way Mental Health care is commissioned, and pressures on Ambulance Services can impact on policing. In situations where an individual is in crisis, such as those placed under Section 136 of the Mental Health Act 1983 and may represent a danger to themselves or others, too often the police service is expected to act as 'last resort' with insufficient support from the health and social care partners who are better placed to deal with the needs of the individual.  PCCs need the power to apply policy or financial levers on these partner services in such circumstances, or there should be a transfer of resources nationally.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]8.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This is one of the areas where PCCs have been able to demonstrate a clear difference over the system that preceded them. PCCs are more engaged and better recognised by their local communities. They communicate and consult more with the local community and as such their agenda better reflects the priorities of local people. Whilst only 7% of the public were aware that they could go to their police authority if they were unhappy with their policing (Cabinet Office Research 2007), a ComRes poll for the BBC revealed that 62% of the public are aware of the work of PCCs. PCCs are achieving this greater recognition as a result of the level of engagement with their communities. &#xa0;8.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; PCCs can demonstrate substantial engagement with their local communities. The Staffordshire PCC for example has engaged face to face with over 12,000 people in Staffordshire since 1 January 2013.&#xa0;8.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; PCCs are progressing good work to promote their local policing priorities. Below provides a summary of the most often mentioned PCC’s individual key priorities in police and crime plans:&#xa0;&#xa0;8.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In Cambridgeshire the following initiative have been undertaken in response to local priorities:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]9.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Collaboration is one of a number of areas of focus, and experience shows that collaboration projects are often a big commitment of resources while they are being planned, and often take time to produce real benefits. Many forces are focusing on ensuring that they are as efficient as possible before undertaking more ambitious collaboration projects.&#xa0;9.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; PCCs are collaborating well with other PCCs. In the South West for example PCCs meet every six weeks and have already approved three collaborative ventures. &#xa0;9.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Whilst fully recognising the value of collaboration, Commissioners are focused on the here and now, and the really big savings on budgets at this time still come from reducing directly employed staff levels, and increasing the efficiency of those that remain.&#xa0;9.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Although focussed on the here and now there are great examples of PCCs reaping the benefits of sharing resources with different agencies. For example, the co-location of services where police, council and health workers are all based in the same building generates modest financial benefits but also has a much more fundamental benefit of getting agencies to work better in partnership which feeds into the strategic overview of reducing crime and reducing demand.&#xa0;9.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There is a long list of examples of where collaboration is successfully progressing. These include: &#xa0;9.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Work will continue on collaboration with local, regional and national partners and with the public and private sectors to maintain the momentum on collaboration and generate efficiencies and value for money for our communities.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]10.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; PCCs take transparency very seriously and equate this with empowering communities to hold them to account effectively.  Many have taken steps to improve information about both themselves and the force – for instance, Ian Johnston, PCC in Gwent has launched a PCC App to inform the public about what he is doing, and Sue Mountstevens, PCC in Avon and Somerset, has launched an on-line ‘track my crime’ service for victims.&#xa0;10.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; PCCs are now publishing their expenses and other related information appropriately.  No national register has been created, in part because of the bureaucracy and complexity involved, but also because most PCCs feel that this is a matter of local accountability. &#xa0;10.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;  In addition to equality and diversity within their own offices, PCCs also have a duty to ensure their forces are compliant with their equality duties and that they adhere to the relevant guidance on employment processes and procedures, including recruitment and retention. &#xa0;10.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; All PCCs have now completed their annual registration as Data Controllers, but in any event, the transition provisions in the PRSRA meant PCCs were covered by the former police authority registrations.&#xa0;10.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Mechanisms to check the accuracy of crime data are in place in all forces, but PCCs are not complacent and know that more can be done.  The current thematic inspection of data integrity by HMIC will be an important step in informing PCCs what more should be done – although several have already put additional steps in place.  For instance, Nick Alston in Essex is setting up an integrity committee, whose terms of reference will include checking force data independently.&#xa0;
