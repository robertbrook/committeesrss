"Written evidence submitted by Dr Judith Freedman, Convener, The Consortium of Expert Witnesses to the Family Courts (LAI 0081)&#xa0;\nI write on behalf of the nearly 600 members of the Consortium of Expert Witnesses to the Family Courts. \nOur members comprise expert clinicians from a variety of disciplines that report to the Family Courts, including paediatrics, adult and child psychiatry, psychology, and independent social work. We provide professional input\n \nregarding non-accidental injuri\nes, mental health issues within families, and child development. \n&#xa0;\nAlthough you have raised particular issues about the Governmentâ€™s proposals to restrict legal aid, \nplease\n consider \nthe\n \nhuman rights \nissues that \ncurrently \nare affecting children and families\n who are before the Family Courts. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThis input to the\n Courts has largely disappeared for \nthe \nfamilies who \nneed public support and no longer have it. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat is being lost is the clinical expertise and experience of senior professionals who have contributed to the working of the Family Co\nurts for many years. Medical specialists \nhelp\n the Courts to identify non-accidental injuries, sometimes when they \na\nre not suspected. They \nhelp\n the Courts to identify cases where non-accidental injuries \na\nre wrongly suspected. \nWhen mental health clinicians i\ndentify treatable problems, families \ncan be helped to\n remain together, reducing the risk of poor outcomes for a child growing up in care and the \nfinancial cost to \nsociety\n. Conversely, prompt mental health assessments can identify poor prognosis and high le\nvels of risk, reducing delay for the child and reducing cost by assisting the Court in speedy resolution of these cases.\n&#xa0;\nThe real victims are the children and their families who are the subjects of Family Court proceedings. They will not have the benefit \nof expert clinical input to the \nC\nourts when decisions are made about their future.\n \nDecisions made without relevant and accurate evidence risk justice being undermined for children and families who cannot afford to pay privately\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI am available to discuss these matters further with you or to give evidence in person, if you wish. \n&#xa0;\n27 September 2013\n1\n&#xa0;\n"
