defaultTAXATION OF PARTNERSHIPS: DRAFT FINANCE BILL 2014 PROVISIONSdefault&#xa0;defaultOriginsdefault&#xa0;default1.
default              
defaultThe possibility of conducting a formal review of certain aspects of the tax rules on partnerships (including limited liability partnerships (LLPs)) was first mentioned at Autumn Statement 2012 as part of a Written Ministerial Statement (WMS) announcing the closure of a tax avoidance scheme involving partnership tax rules. The WMS stated that the Government would consider partnership taxation as part of its review of high risk areas of the tax code.  
default&#xa0;

default              
defaultThis was followed by a formal announcement at Budget 2013 indicating that the Government would consult on introducing legislation effective from April 2014 to:

default3.
default              
defaultHMRC consulted stakeholders informally between the run-up to Budget 2013 and the publication of the formal consultation document in May 2013.  The evidence gathered at this stage informed the consultation proposals and the Government’s decision to introduce legislative changes. The formal consultation ran for 12 weeks ending in early August, attracting about 110 written responses. 
default&#xa0;
default4.
default              
defaultAutumn Statement 2013 reaffirmed that the G
defaultovernment would take forward the proposals as modified following consideration of the consultation responses and that t
defaulthe changes 
defaultwould take effect from April 2014 as previously announced.

defaultDraft Finance Bill 2014 clauses and guidance were published in December for technical consultation, which will close on 4 February 2014.   
default&#xa0;

default              
defaultAssociated changes to the National Insurance contributions (NICs) legislation in relation to Salaried Members and alternative investment fund managers are being introduced under the NICs Bill 2013 and these will take effect from 6 April 2014.

default              
defaultThe Budget 2013 announcement stated that significant tax revenues were at risk from these tax-motivated arrangements.  Information obtained during the consultation showed that the use of mixed membership structures was far more widespread amongst the alternative investment fund managers (typically hedge 
defaultfunds) who operate as a partnership than originally expected. The 
defaultcostings
default certified by the Office of Budget Responsibility and published at Autumn Statement (AS) 2013 were accordingly increased as follows (with all extra yield attributable to the investment fund manager sector):

default&#xa0;defaultObjectives of the review default&#xa0;default8.
default              
defaultMinisters have made clear that 
defaultthe objective of the review has been to secure tax revenue and achieve fairer taxation, primarily by:
default&#xa0;
default9.
default              
defaultThe first issue reflects the fact that individual members of LLPs are currently taxed as self-employed partners even if they are engaged on terms closer to those of employees.  This can produce unfairness in the tax system as an individual member of an LLP who is treated as a partner receives more favourable treatment than a member of a traditional partnership. The difference results in significant loss of tax and NICs, much of it attributable to individuals who would normally be regarded as employees in high-salaried professional areas such as the legal sector. 
default&#xa0;
default10.
default              
defaultThe second issue reflects the fact that under partnership and tax law, it is not necessary for profit-sharing ratios to be in proportion to contributions, effort or capital, or to be the same from year to year. This flexibility has been used to generate tax advantages. For example, profits may be allocated to a low tax entity, such as a company, while individual partners taxable at higher income tax rates ultimately receive the benefit of those profits in low-taxed or even non-taxable form.  
default&#xa0;defaultDetail of the proposalsdefault&#xa0;defaultSalaried Members
default11.
default              
defaultThe draft legislation sets out 3 conditions
default, all of which must be met before an LLP member can be classified a Salaried Member. These conditions are that the member:
defaultA) is to be wholly (or almost wholly) rewarded for services by a fixed amount or, if variable, by an amount that does not vary according to the profitability of the firm;
default&#xa0;
defaultB) 
defaultdoes
default not have a significant influence over the firm’s affairs; and
default&#xa0;
defaultC) 
defaulthas
default not contributed a significant amount of capital (25% or more of the fixed payment entitlement).
default&#xa0;default12.
default              
defaultWhere all 3 conditions are met, then from 6 April 2014, the individual member will be treated as an employee of the LLP for tax and NIC purposes. Failing to meet any one of these conditions will mean that the member continues to be treated as a partner. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTax-motivated allocations of business profits or losses in mixed partnerships 
default&#xa0;
default13.
default              
defaultThe new rules will reallocate excess profits from a non-individual partner to an individual partner where: 
default&#xa0;
default14.
default              
defaultIn certain circumstances, profits may be reallocated to an individual who performs services for the partnership through a non-individual partner (for example, a personal service company) if it is reasonable to suppose that the individual would have been a partner but for the new rules. 
default&#xa0;
default15.
default              
defaultThe new rules will also deny individuals income tax loss relief and capital gains relief for partnership losses allocated to an individual partner as part of arrangements, the main purpose of which is to secure the allocation of some or all of the loss to the individual, instead of a non-individual, with a view to the individual obtaining relief. 
default&#xa0;
default16.
default              
defaultThe mixed membership proposals will not be relevant to traditional partnerships consisting wholly of individuals (or wholly of 
defaultcorporates
default), nor where profit and loss allocations are made on a basis that properly reflects the contribution made to the partnership by the relevant members.
default&#xa0;
defaultTax-motivated disposals of income streams through partnerships
default&#xa0;
default17.
default              
defaultThe legislation will impose a charge to tax on income where a person disposes of all or part of an income stream by or 
defaultthough
default a partnership if the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of the disposal, or any of the steps by which 
defaultthe disposal is effected, is to secure a tax advantage in relation to the charge to income tax or the charge to corporation tax on income.  
defaultWhat do these changes say about the overall state of partnership taxation?default&#xa0;
default18.
default              
defaultThe tax rules applicable to traditional partnerships (those established under the Partnership Act 1890 or the Limited Partnership Act 1907) respect the fact that in English law the partnership is a transparent entity. The tax rules likewise treat them as tax transparent. Any profits of the partnership are attributed to the partners according to their profit shares and tax is then levied at that level through the income tax self-assessment (or corporation tax self-assessment) system. Partners who are individuals rather than companies are also charged NICs. 
default&#xa0;
default19.
default              
defaultThe salaried member proposals relate only to LLPs and do not have any wider significance for partnership taxation. The LLP is a body corporate and has little in common with a traditional partnership apart from its tax treatment.  In most areas, it is subject to the same rules as a company. Like a limited company, it gives members the benefits of limited liability. 
default&#xa0;
default20.
default              
defaultIn the absence of specific tax rules, the LLP would be taxed as a company. However, the tax rules introduced for LLPs in 2000 for most purposes treat it like a traditional partnership.  Individual members are taxed as self employed partners and company members are liable to corporation tax according to their respective profit shares. 
default&#xa0;
default21.
default              
default              
defaultThese tax rules go further than intended and result in all LLP members being classified as self-employed. This outcome was never intended and given rise to significant risk to the loss of employment taxes which will be prevented by the proposed rules. 
default&#xa0;
default22.
default              
defaultThe proposals relating to partnerships with mixed membership reflect the fact that the flexibility of partnership profit and loss allocation rules combined with differentials between income tax and corporate tax rates currently gives rise to significant loss of tax.  This is not exclusively a partnership issue but reflects a wider issue about rate differentials. 
default&#xa0;
default23.
default              
defaultThe proposals relating to transfers of income streams through partnerships respond to a particular issue involving tax legislation introduced in 2009 to deal with sales of income streams. These rules do not always work effectively where the transfer is achieved through or by a partnership (for example, by means of a change in profit-sharing ratios), and the changes now proposed will correct this.  Again, this is not primarily a partnership issue. 
default&#xa0;default24.
default              
defaultThe Government has been clear from the start of the review that the FB2014 measures are not only about avoidance, but about making structural changes to tax rules to prevent loss of tax. HMRC and the Government stated in the consultation document and during consultation meetings that the vast majority of partnerships 
defaultdo not engage in avoidance or in the types of tax-motivated activity that will be affected by the proposed changes.
