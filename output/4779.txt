&#xa0;6 January 2014&#xa0;&#xa0;Written Submission from Nedim C. Buyukmihci, V.M.D. Emeritus Professor of Veterinary Medicine School of Veterinary Medicine University of California-Davis&#xa0;&#xa0;Summary relative to the three points enumerated:&#xa0;•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The extent of the trade and keeping of primates as pets within the UK&#xa0;I have no personal information on this and have not commented on this point.&#xa0;•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Whether the existing regulatory framework and Code of Practice offer adequate protection for the welfare of primates kept as pets and are being applied effectively&#xa0;Members of the various species of non-human primates have unique and complex requirements that are integral to their welfare and well-being. Because the conditions necessary to meet those requirements are not likely to ever be possible or feasible in captivity, particularly when these animals are kept as pets in private homes, no regulatory framework could logically be adequate or effective.&#xa0;•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Whether people should be allowed to keep primates as pets and, if not, how a ban might be implemented&#xa0;People should not be allowed to keep primates as pets because it is inherently a cruel practice and it is dangerous to society. Law could be written to ban any further acquisition of primates and to allow for re-homing of existing pets into proper sanctuaries.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The substantial negative impact caused by trapping and removal of wild non-human primates from their natural social groups is universally recognized by relevant organizations and official bodies, for example, the International Primatological Society (21), the World Health Organization (38), Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare (SCAHAW; European Union) (1), Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER) (34) and the United Kingdom Animal Procedures Committee (UKAPC) (19).&#xa0;Beyond the inherent negative impact of capture, there are the issues of the methods of capture and the transportation of the animals once captured. There has been much evidence accumulated over the years that has revealed the immense suffering that is inflicted on non-human primates during their capture, caging, holding and transportation to an artificial facility, whether it be breeding or research. I have evaluated this evidence and found that the conditions in which the animals have been housed at various supply and breeding facilities that export primates were often appalling and unacceptable, even by current standards which leave much to be desired. Many conditions breached the International Primatological Society's minimalist animal welfare guidelines.&#xa0;Studies have shown that transportation causes profound negative effects on the behavior and welfare of non-human primates (14,20,33). The animals are often packed into small wooden crates and travel as cargo. The crates are too small to permit normal postural adjustments nor any exercise. Transportation to the final destination, including air and ground transit times, can take days to complete. The animals may also have to endure inadequate ventilation, noise, extreme temperature fluctuations and delays en route. Statistics for primate deaths and illnesses either during transportation or subsequently are generally not publicized. Examples of animals found dead on arrival, often as a result of distress and shock due to the conditions on board, have been documented.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;References:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“...discourages all individuals from privately owning primates for non-scientific or non-educational purposes and from breeding and selling or otherwise supplying nonhuman primates for non-scientific or non-educational purposes.”&#xa0;&#xa0;“The AVMA does not support the use of nonhuman primates as assistance animals because of animal welfare concerns, the potential for serious injury, and zoonotic risks.”&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“Under no circumstances should any primates be dispositioned to a private individual or to the pet trade.”&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
