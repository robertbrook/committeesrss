[[[Executive Summary: ]]]Disabled peopleâ€™s access to assistive devices is a human right recognized by the United Nations. However, for disabled individuals in the developing world, assistive devices are often difficult to obtain, and, when they are available, inappropriate for both the user and the environment. An appropriate assistive device can dramatically improve the health and quality of life of the user, but an inappropriate one can cause serious and potentially deadly medical complications. Despite this, assistive devices receive little attention from institutional development agencies. Furthermore, development projects are frequently designed without consideration of the needs of disabled people and as a result, disabled people are excluded and marginalized from much-needed programmes. The Department for International Development is called upon to adhere to international guidelines on disability, include both disabled people and attention to assistive devices in development projects and to ensure that all assistive devices used in their programmes are appropriate for the needs of the beneficiaries. Without this, development efforts will fail by neglecting a vulnerable portion of the world. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0; UNCRPD, 3 May 2008  World Health Organisation, 2011
