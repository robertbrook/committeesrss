[[[Ulster Bank Ltd]]]&#xa0;

[[[1. Structure and Governance]]]&#xa0;Ulster Bank was founded in 1836 to provide a reliable banking service for merchants in Belfast. It has for over 150 years been an all-Ireland business and has been central to the economy of the island. &#xa0;The bank is a member of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS) and operates as Ulster Bank Ltd in Northern Ireland as a direct subsidiary of the National Westminster Bank plc. Ulster Bank Ireland Ltd in the Republic of Ireland is a subsidiary of Ulster Bank Ltd. &#xa0;Ulster Bank serves 1.9 million customers on the island of Ireland. It is the leading retail and business bank in Northern Ireland – with 710,000 customers in the province – 670,000 personal banking and 40,000 business banking customers. The bank has a Retail Banking division which has the largest share of the personal banking market in the province at 25% and a Business Banking division which has a significant share of the Northern Ireland business banking market at 30%. In the face of intense competition from other banks and building societies, Ulster Bank has a 20% share of the new mortgage lending market and it has the largest branch network of any bank in Northern Ireland, with 79 branches.&#xa0;The management structure of Ulster Bank Group is structurally similar to comparable businesses within the RBS Group (see Appendix 1). Ulster Bank Group is headed by Chief Executive, Jim Brown and an Executive Committee team of nine colleagues (four of whom are based in Belfast - the Managing Directors of Business Banking and Retail Banking for the entire island of Ireland, the Head of Human Resources and the Chief Operating Officer).&#xa0;The Chief Executive of Ulster Bank Group is a member of the RBS Group’s Management Committee, which is responsible for reviewing strategy and monitoring performance in relation to the business of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc and its subsidiaries. Strategy, risk appetite, pricing and products are governed by Ulster Bank – although it seeks to leverage group systems and product capability where possible.&#xa0;The bank also has standalone governance structures. The Board of Ulster Bank Ltd has a chair from Northern Ireland who is based in Dublin, two non-executive directors from the Province, three non-executive directors from the Republic of Ireland, two representatives from RBS and an independent member from the United Kingdom (UK). &#xa0;In Northern Ireland, Ulster Bank has appointed a specific head of Ulster Bank Northern Ireland, Ellvena Graham. She heads a leadership forum that focuses on the strategy, performance and development of the business in Northern Ireland. This is an explicit recognition of the critical role Ulster Bank plays in Northern Ireland society and, in particular, in helping drive forward the province’s economy. The Head of Ulster Bank Northern Ireland regularly briefs the Board on strategy and activity in the province.&#xa0;

[[[4. Access to Finance, particula]]]

[[[rly for small to medium enterprises]]]&#xa0;A successful and thriving business sector is an important driver of economic growth. Ulster Bank has always recognised it has a key role to play in supporting business development across Northern Ireland and it has the right combination of products to help companies, large and small, achieve their ambitions. &#xa0;Ulster Bank believes in the quality and potential of small businesses in Northern Ireland and it provides them with the support they need. In Ulster Bank’s six business centres, there are 258 full-time employees dedicated to Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) businesses in Northern Ireland. During 2012, the bank approved £181 million in new lending to business customers. 88% of businesses that applied for credit in 2012 were granted facilities. Over the past 12 months, Ulster Bank has helped more than 2,000 start-ups, supporting new enterprise, business development and job creation. In the year to date, Ulster Bank has signed up in excess of 800 start-up customers. In the past seven months, the bank has also identified 25 new business development managers who are dedicated to seeking new business opportunities and working with firms to help them grow and are put through regular credit training. The bank was the first in Northern Ireland to join the Bank of England's Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS). Ulster Bank supported the National Loan Guarantee Scheme and it has also dominated the provision of the Enterprise Finance Guarantee scheme (EFG) in the province (see Section 5 for full statistics). Ulster Bank provides positive practical and relevant support tailored to meet the needs and demands of the market. In 2011, the bank launched its start up campaign to support new and emerging customers and in turn support the growth of local economies. Ulster Bank offers support and mentoring to businesses through its unique Smallbusinesscan online network which regularly attracts over 20,000 users each month.Ulster Bank tailors its product range to support customers, with a range of funding options available to SMEs, including: the EFG scheme which provides working capital where normal lending is not available due to lack of security.The bank works with customers to examine other funding options to help cashflow including invoice discounting and asset finance solutions. Ulster Bank has an independent appeals system in place to address those who are declined lending. &#xa0;In the agri-food sector, Ulster Bank sanctioned during 2012 more than £40 million of new facilities and consequently its net lending to agriculture (ie the amount lent after all repayments had been received) grew by 1% year-on-year. The bank demonstrated its commitment to the agri-food sector through the creation of a £10 million Weather Fund to help farmers cope with the heavy snow at the end of March. It is also the principal sponsor of Northern Ireland’s main agricultural showpiece event, the Balmoral Show which an estimated 100,000 people attended this year.&#xa0;Ulster Bank believes there is a particular challenge in Northern Ireland around accessing venture capital that needs to be addressed. Northern Ireland’s banks, along with Government, have shouldered the role of financing most start-ups in the absence of significant equity funding. This may in part be due to the limited opportunities for substantial Venture Capital returns in a smaller economy dominated by the public sector and reliant on UK subvention. But there has also been a lack of ambition from local investors when it comes to developing Venture Capital funded growth plans. This may be explained by a lack of peer examples and an unwillingness to give up equity in family businesses. This cultural difference may also be a by-product of The Troubles.&#xa0;The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) acknowledged the problem in its ‘Getting Growth Finance Growing’ report last year. In a climate where bank lending to sustainable sectors has not stopped, the CBI said there needed to be greater access to private sources of capital. Northern Ireland is too dependent on bank and public financing and lags considerably behind other regions of the UK on equity financing which will be essential if the province is to develop the kind of first class knowledge economy the Stormont Executive is aiming for.&#xa0;The CBI noted the British Venture Capital Association (BVCA) reported private equity accessed by its members in Northern Ireland fell from £163 million in 2010 to just £21 million in 2011. In Scotland, the BVCA’s members accessed £179 million in private equity in 2010 and £393 million respectively, while in Wales private equity accounted for £78 million and £127 million.

[[[Legacy Issues]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Ulster Bank is addressing the issue of companies with problem debt – much of which is an overhang from the property boom on the island – through our Global Restructuring Group (GRG) which works with companies with debts of over £1 million and our Specialised Relationship Managers (SRM) whose primary focus is to support SME customers with exposures under £1 million and help return their businesses back to good health. &#xa0;In Northern Ireland, the bank has a legacy portfolio of £5.8 billion of primarily property related lending, managed by a team of 143 GRG and SRM employees.&#xa0;In all cases, both teams seek consensual solutions with customers on a case by case basis. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to achieve agreement. In these circumstances, the bank has to take difficult decisions which may, regrettably, include the appointment of an insolvency practitioner. This is not a decision Ulster Bank takes lightly.&#xa0;Over the past 18 months, however, GRG has helped protect 5,500 jobs and is on course to return £200 million of Northern Ireland exposure across numerous trading businesses, to the mainstream bank during 2013. GRG has also provided approximately £50 million of additional finance to the Corporate and SME sector in NI to provide development and trading finance.&#xa0;

[[[Lack of effectiveness of national i]]]

[[[nitiatives to help aid economic ]]]

[[[recovery ]]]Ulster Bank has a strong record of participation in incentive schemes that the Government has made available to all UK licensed banks. In particular, the bank has embraced the Bank of England’s Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS), lending £100 million to more than 650 customers since it was launched in mid-September 2012. The FLS is a good method of providing affordable finance to businesses across Northern Ireland.Although all the main lenders in Northern Ireland participate in the Enterprise Finance Guarantee scheme (EFG), Ulster Bank has dominated the provision of EFG funding in the Northern Ireland market since the launch of the scheme in 2009, accounting for 77% of all financing by value.Ulster Bank believes EFG has an important role to play in accessing finance for new investment opportunities. The bank has suggested that Government should re-visit the level of the net cap, increasing it to at least 33%. This would recognise the fundamental difference between Northern Ireland’s economy and the rest of the UK - Northern Ireland has a much greater reliance on the public sector and a preponderance of micro businesses. Ulster Bank also believes Government should develop a co-ordinated marketing initiative with banks to promote EFG and should consider marketing and aligning the scheme to specific business sectors.

[[[. Lack of availability of detailed regional l]]]

[[[ending data]]]With regards to business lending, Ulster Bank completes a monthly Bank of England return through RBS Group which shows our lending figures. However, one of the challenges in Northern Ireland is the lack of consistency in the definition of new lending across banks. For example, while Ulster Bank may not count renewals as a new loan, its competitors may count it. Therefore, if regional lending data is to be effective, there needs to be an agreed common definition of what constitutes new lending. In Northern Ireland, the British Bankers Association is working with banks and the Northern Ireland Executive on relevant data to inform the local business landscape. Whilst Ulster Bank is supportive of this principle, before committing to the publication, like the other banks, it will require assurances around data protection, customer confidentiality, consistency of definition and ensuring commercially sensitive information is secure.

[[[ Access to banking in rural communities]]].Ulster Bank recognises the importance many of its customers place in face to face contact with staff and it is cognisant of the important role branches play in the commercial heart of a community.However, throughout the world, banks – and other retail sectors – are witnessing significant changes in customer behaviour. More people are availing of online, telephone and mobile banking services and branch usage is declining. The trend is no different at Ulster Bank which is also witnessing a significant shift in customer behaviour. Customers now do more than twice as many transactions through new digital mobile phone and Internet banking channels as they do in branches.This has meant Ulster Bank, like all UK, Irish and international banks, has had to adjust to changing customer needs and that has inevitably led to an ongoing review of our branch network. With 79 branches, Ulster Bank still has the largest branch network in Northern Ireland and is committed to continuing to provide branch banking services to personal and business customers in both rural and urban locations. The bank has 246 free to use ATMs across Northern Ireland. In addition, current account customers (including basic account holders) are able to check their balance and withdraw cash from post offices. Ulster Bank customers are able to use any branch to carry out their banking, not only their account holding branch. As result of the change in customer behaviour, Ulster Bank has since March 2013 made our Anytime Banking apps, Internet centre and contact centre available to SMEs. The contact centre has been operating 24 hours, seven days a week. In June 2013, Ulster Bank closed seven branches and four part-time sub offices in Northern Ireland. As a matter of course full due diligence will be carried out before we make any future decisions on specific branches.&#xa0;Closing any branch is never easy but in reaching a decision, Ulster Bank looks at its geographic branch coverage across the province and the proximity of other branches to the location being considered for closure. Ulster Bank looks at customer numbers, footfall and the number of transactions going through an individual branch. Consideration – and engagement with relevant stakeholders – is also given in decision-making to the needs of specific customer groups – for example, benefit recipients, vulnerable customers, elderly and young customers.&#xa0;During the recent branch closures, as part of Ulster Bank’s engagement with impacted customers, it wrote to its customers at least 12 weeks in advance to inform them that their branch was closing and to advise them of the details of their new branch including the nearest free to use ATM. During this process, branch managers also identified and met individual vulnerable customers, so they could put in place steps that would meet those customers’ banking needs. Ulster Bank will replicate this approach for any future closures, and in addition, it will seek to strengthen its measures for vulnerable customers with an education programme to help them register and use our online, telephone and mobile banking services. This will include holding open master classes and individual customer meetings in branches in the period prior to closure to provide face-to-face support to help customers use Anytime Banking services.&#xa0;Ulster Bank will also continue to ensure that, where possible, staff from branches that have closed are moved to other branches in their locality to maintain some continuity for customers who like to see a familiar face in their branch.&#xa0;Ulster Bank recognises that for some customers in rural locations, telephone or online banking is not always viable. To that end, the bank will be reintroducing in Northern Ireland a mobile banking van service to extend face-to-face banking services to customers and communities where branches close. Ulster Bank will continue to give consideration to other inclusive services for our customers, particularly those in rural areas.&#xa0;&#xa0;
