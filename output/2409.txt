[[[Legal Aid- the Secret ]]]

[[[Legal ]]]

[[[Service?]]]&#xa0;LAG has found a disturbing reduction in the take-up of legal aid cases in civil law for the first quarter of the current year, 2013/14.&#xa0;The Legal Aid Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders (LASPO) Act introduced sweeping cuts to scope in legal aid from April this year. What LAG’s research shows is that for the cases which are still covered by legal aid there has been a large reduction in the take-up of legal aid services for these by public. We believe this has been caused by a combination of factors including, the reduction in the number of solicitors firms and charities, such as Citizens Advice Bureaux, offering legal aid, a perception amongst the public that they can no-longer get help with any civil law problems and the failure by the government to adequately advertise the availability of services.&#xa0;

[[[Downward Trend in Cases]]]&#xa0;Previous figures released by LAG show that the number of civil legal aid cases has been in decline over the last few years. It is in the social welfare law (SWL) category that the biggest falls have occurred. From just under half a million cases at their peak in 2009-10 the number of SWL cases had dropped to 293,319 last year. The following table breaks down the figures for legal help and certificated cases for the five categories of SWL-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;2009/102010/112011/122012/13Welfare benefits143,865120,042110,77188,618Debt&#xa0;147,194128,179109,42782,117Housing&#xa0;153,106127,840118,909100,253Employment/Discrimination31,79625,33020,32416,148Community Care9,7037,0607,4486,183&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;485,664408,451366,879293,319&#xa0;&#xa0;The reducing number of SWL cases is surprising given the continuing difficult economic outlook and the numbers of cases reaching the courts and tribunals system. For example in the quarter ending 31st Dec 2012 there had been a 48% increase in the number of cases brought to the Social Security and Child Support Tribunal. Citizens Advice has also reported increasing numbers of enquiries in the first three quarters of 2012/13. However, in the final quarter Bureaux capacity to deal with specialist cases was reduced as they prepared for the withdrawal of legal aid from much of SWL.  We believe the reduction in the numbers of cases since 2010 has been caused by changes to the system, such as the reduction in the numbers of cases legal aid firm are permitted to commence, rather than a decrease in the numbers of people needing assistance. &#xa0;The trend over the last few years has been of concern, but the latest figures for the first quarter of the current year (outlined below) show that the take-up of legal aid services in common areas of civil law has fallen off a cliff.&#xa0;

[[[Fewer Cases than Predicted]]]&#xa0;The following table shows the percentage number of cases which the government predicted would remain in scope after the cuts were introduced in April-&#xa0;&#xa0;Category of law&#xa0;Debt (mainly housing related)26%Education42%Discrimination100%Housing60%Welfare Benefits0&#xa0;The above table refers to legal help cases. Legal help cases involve initial advice and assistance to a client. Some cases go onto legal representation, but the bulk of cases referred to in this report remain at the legal help level. For example in 2012/13 there were 81,944 new matters started for legal help with debt problems, but only 353 cases went on to the next level, civil representation.&#xa0;The table below shows the total number of legal help cases for each category of law for the first quarter of the current year, the projected number of cases is based on the government’s estimates and the percentage shortfall in the number of cases has been calculated by LAG. The analysis is based on figures from the Legal Aid Agency (LAA) the new body which was established within the Ministry of Justice from April this year to administer legal aid. &#xa0;&#xa0;AprilMayJuneTotalProjected number of cases%ShortfallDebt1731461574761,46768%Education916912128131812%Discrimination1682051795522,42977%Housing8066317052,1423,23834%Welfare Benefits45484213500%&#xa0;

[[[This is a total shortfall ]]]

[[[of 52%. ]]] The shortfalls do vary between the different categories of law, with the lowest being in education law at 12% and the highest being in discrimination law at 77%.  &#xa0;LAG believes that the very large shortfall in discrimination law can be explained by the 100% reduction in the availability of legal aid for employment law cases. In the employment law category the government projected that 78% of cases, out of a total of 24,000, would be taken from scope. The remaining 22% would be discrimination ones. However, most discrimination law cases usually stem from a dispute in the workplace, but as no legal aid is available for employment law advice people who have been discriminated against are less likely to seek help. Another factor in the low take-up of legal aid for discrimination, as well as debt cases, might also be the government’s decision to shift all initial enquiries onto the Civil Legal Advice (CLA) service which is an internet and telephone based service.&#xa0;

[[[Low take-up of ]]]

[[[Housing ]]]

[[[and Debt ]]]

[[[Cases]]]&#xa0;Legal Aid is still available for people in danger of losing their homes, homelessness cases and for some disrepair matters. Such cases can be covered by either the debt or housing law categories. Debt legal aid contracts were mainly concentrated among advice charities such as Citizens Advice Bureaux. These have seen the biggest reduction in the number of legal aid contract holders. According to the national charity, Citizen’s Advice, there are now only just over 30 of its bureaux with legal aid contracts, down from a total of over 160 before the cuts were imposed in April.&#xa0;Birmingham CAB held one of the largest legal aid contracts in the not for profit sector. The service operates out of four offices in Birmingham. Prior to April it employed 27 specialist caseworkers in debt and welfare benefits, but according to Emma Cook, acting Chief Executive of the Bureaux, all of these post holders have had to be made redundant or redeployed, “the loss of the £750,000 contract for legal aid meant a third of the service went from 31st March. These specialist services cannot be replaced by volunteers.”&#xa0;Russell Conway, is an experienced housing law solicitor who recently won the Legal Aid Lawyer of the Year Award for his work in housing and other areas of social welfare law. He blames in part the unrelenting bad news on legal aid for the reduction in cases, “the public are quite good at picking-up on the grim stuff”, but “find it difficult to know exactly what’s happened.” He says that “some local authorities and social landlords have been peddling the rumour that legal aid for housing cases has been abolished completely. Some of my clients have been pleasantly surprised when I’ve told them they can still get legal aid for their case.” &#xa0;Many practitioners have told LAG they believe that there is a problem over the identification of clients who are eligible for legal aid as the rules now are so complex. Vicky Ling is a management consultant and author of LAG’s Legal Aid Handbook. She says that “the Legal Aid Agency is now so draconian in their audits that practitioners fear applying for legal aid unless they are absolutely certain it will fall within the rules.” &#xa0;Welfare benefits cases were cut by 100% from April, but 135 new cases were commenced in April, May and June this year. This is around 3% of the cases which were reported in the same period last year. LAG believes that these cases are Higher Tribunal, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court cases which relate to an appeal on a point of law,&#xa0;Only in family law does the number of cases exceed the projected number of cases significantly (14%), but this could be due to a combination of the tapering effect and the greater number of firms still providing services, (from April there were 2227 family law legal aid contracts against 703 housing and debt contracts).&#xa0;

[[[Lack of Marketing]]]&#xa0;Pam Kenworthy is the Legal Director at the solicitors firm Howells LLP. The firm won one of the contracts for the telephone gateway service. Kenworthy believes that both lawyers and the public need to get the message that employment law discrimination cases are still covered by legal aid. “The CLA providers would obviously like the Ministry of Justice to consider raising the profile of the service with stakeholders as it seems daft to have a service that no one knows about.” &#xa0;The Legal Aid Practitioners Group (LAPG) has expressed concerns to the government about the adequacy of the marketing of legal aid services, “we believe it has been inadequate and is some cases unfortunately misleading” says Carol Storer, LAPG Director, “the information which is available does not provide clear guidance to the public about what is covered by legal aid.”&#xa0;

[[[Exceptional Cases]]]&#xa0;As part of the provisions in the LASPO Act the government introduced a revamped exceptional funding rule to ensure people with cases out of scope can get assistance if their human rights had been breached. The LAA had estimated that there would 5-7000 cases granted annually.&#xa0;Figures from the LAA reveal that there were only 233 applications for exceptional funding in April, May and June this year the first quarter of operation for the scheme.  Only two grants of exceptional funding to clients have been made in non-inquest cases (funding for inquest cases was usually granted under the previous exceptional funding scheme). The Public Law Project (PLP) has expressed concerns about these figures as they are very low compared to the original projections and there is evidence of poor quality decision making in the cases being rejected.&#xa0;It is difficult not to conclude that the LAA is being deliberately obstructive in not allowing many of the claims. The PLP talks of the “poor quality of decision-making” in the cases which it has seen and expresses concern about the low number of applicants who seek reviews of the decisions.&#xa0;LAG has spoken to many practitioners who are not prepared to apply for exceptional funding as they have no guarantee of payment for the work unless the application is successful. Chris Johnson of the Community Law Partnership in Birmingham has submitted a number of exceptional funding applications but says “we cannot afford to keep on doing this work pro-bono.”&#xa0;

[[[Civil Legal Aid under threat]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The reduced take-up of civil legal aid has been caused by the combination of factors described above, dwindling numbers of firms and agencies undertaking legal aid, increased bureaucratic hurdles before legal aid is granted and a low profile, caused by lack of marketing and a public perception that legal aid is no-longer available for civil cases. Either by accident or design, the government seems to be presiding over a secret legal service. The fear is if nothing is done to increase the take-up of civil legal aid, the remaining services will wither away as the lack of use will be used to justify their loss.&#xa0;LAG calls on the government to increase the profile of civil legal aid services through better marketing via the web and other channels. We are also calling for an urgent review of the exceptional funding mechanism as it is clearly not providing the human rights safety net it was intended to.  &#xa0;25 September 2013&#xa0;4LAG September 2013- updated version 25-9-13 Legal Aid Statistics in England and Wales 2012-2013 https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/177045/quarterly-tribs-q3-2012-13.pdf See  Advice trends January - March 2013&#xa0;(&#xa0;0.52mb) Based on Reform of Legal Aid in England and Wales: the Government Response, June 2011 Annex A Scope Legal Aid Statistics in England and Wales 2012-13, published June 2013 See Annex to this report LAG believes the figures only relate to enquiries made through the CLA telephone service and so some figures for housing cases which are not all covered by CLA are missing.
