defaultSubmission from defaultSafe Install Electrical Solutionsdefault&#xa0;defaultMy Background and my viewpoint of the industry as a whole
default&#xa0;
defaultI am 29 years old and after serving in the armed forces for five years with distinction I decided to leave and become an electrician. That was in 2006 and ever since then I
default have utilised my personal skill set and my armed forces experience to work towards the goal of  becoming a business leader and starting my own venture.
default&#xa0;
defaultI felt it very important that I first become an expert in my field. However I wasn't prepared for just
default how challenging becoming an electrical expert was. There are many specialisms in the electrical industry, technology is evolving rapidly and to gain experience in all of the specialisms is unrealistic.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat I am saying is to become a highly competent ele
defaultctrician is no easy task. I am about to achieve my Joint Industry Board Technician Status having sat my level 4 design qualification. (I studied very hard and believe I have passed the exam) 
default&#xa0;
defaultI now have nearly eight years experience in the industry. I hav
defaulte worked in the Nuclear and Solar industry as well as for companies such as National Grid, EDFE, Western Power and having worked on a whole range of projects from swimming pools, ASDA superstores, Nuclear Power plants and High Voltage Earthing. It has take
defaultn eight years but only now would I feel any truth in saying, “I am highly competent.”
default&#xa0;
defaultYet to become a member of these Part P scheme providers you only have to achieve your 17
defaultth
default Edition exam and pass two installation inspections. If you look on the various
default forums around the internet, the forums are loaded with people who have just passed their 17
defaultth
default edition exam and are now looking to be told how to carry out two installs to pass the Part P compliance inspections from the NICEIC or Elecsa etc etc.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn my vie
defaultw Part P is self defeating. It does absolutely nothing to improve electrical safety. 
default&#xa0;
defaultLet’s
default look at a few other major problems.
default&#xa0;
defaultFirstly, when a job has been completed that is required to be notified under the part p scheme, the only details required are t
defaulthe name and address of the customer as well as sticking a check box to indicate what type of work was carried out.
default&#xa0;
defaultSo what we are allowing is under qualified people to carry out electrical design, installation and testing and then require no design or tes
defaultting parameters to be submitted for scrutiny by someone who does possess the required competence.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn fact, Part P seems to be more of a licence for people who have no competence to easily gain accreditation and carry out dangerous and shoddy work legally.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have licensed the cowboys.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is a vicious cycle out there right now. That vicious cycle goes as follows:
defaultGovernment creates legal licence for cowboys to operate
default&#xa0;
defaultCowboy meets potential victim and does not have the design knowledge to price the 
defaultjob correctly to achieve a safe, compliant installation
default&#xa0;
defaultCustomer decides to buy on price
default&#xa0;
defaultElectrician makes light bulb work
default&#xa0;
defaultCustomer has no idea electrician has installed a potential fire risk due to incorrect design
default&#xa0;
defaultCustomer has no idea metal light fit
defaultting has not been
default earthed or the modified circuit does not meet other requirements such as disconnection times in the event of a fault
default&#xa0;
defaultElectrician is not required to submit design details
default&#xa0;
defaultProblem remains until either house burns down, house is sold and te
defaultsted or customer is killed
default&#xa0;
defaultHighly competent electrician who priced the job correctly looses business and eventually goes bust or moves in to employment
default&#xa0;
defaultGeneral public are left with a mass of cowboys ready to serve with few quality electricians left
default&#xa0;
defaultI w
defaultould invite anyone of the committee to come and work with me for a two month period to experience firsthand
default the effect this has on people’s
default lives and the dangers out there that exist.
default&#xa0;
defaultYou only have to look at the statistics for death, injury and fires cau
defaultsed by electricity. I believe that if the system continues as it is these statistics will rise 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe biggest flaw of all is the fact that there is no mechanism to ensure that work is carried out properly. Time and time again I work for people who have jus
defaultt bought a house. I test and inspect the house and find significant problems.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are too many vested interests and mortgage companies and estate agents are two massive culprits in my view.
default&#xa0;
defaultI believe that there shouyld be a mechanism where before any 
defaulthouse is sold, an independent third party electrical inspector should inspect the property and any defects taken off the price of the house.
default&#xa0;
defaultDIY home owners are getting away with carrying out dangerous electrical work on a massive scale. The problem is ex
defaultacerbated by incompetent electricians, desperate for money who will then come in and sign off the work. Sometimes knowingly sometimes through sheer incompetence.
default&#xa0;
defaultI want to share one last story with you.
default&#xa0;
defaultI was recently tasked with solving a customer’s
default elec
defaulttrical problem. The problem was the young couple were experiencing blown light bulbs, up to 2 a day at times.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat I found was a trail of destruction. I believe what happened there (after speaking with the next door neighbour) was the home owner rewired t
defaulthe house himself.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis couple bought the house and thought the house wiring was fine because they had a Part P compliance certificate. Unfortunately a Napit engineer who had installed the consumer unit was clearly incompetent. I took one look at the test 
defaultresults and could not understand some of the data he had recorded.
default&#xa0;
defaultHe had not carried out any proper testing or inspection, in fact
default I believe he made the results up. There was no earthing on any of the Class 1 metal light fittings. What the previous owner 
defaulthad done was just unbelievable. There were bundles of wires which when I started to inspect, had conductors falling out of connector blocks. Not a single earth cable was sleeved
default or connected to the metal light fittings.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis was just the tip of the iceber
defaultg there and since starting my business two years ago, I am appalled at how weak the industry is in terms of ensuring a robust framework which sets out to increase electrical safety and promote the electrical industry in a positive way.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is just the mo
defaultst recent case and certainly not an isolated case. In fact I believe that as little as 10% or less of electrical installation work is compliant. And don’t think new houses are any different. I have worked on brand new houses with problems.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are not Pain
defaultters and Decorators, we are not carpenters. Electricians should be highly skilled and competent people entrusted to deliver safe and robust installations.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn terms of people being aware of Part P and what it’s
default there for, I’d
default say less than 2% of people
default understand Part P with probably around 60% falling in to the I need
default a certificate
default category and the remainder just either not caring or knowing.
default&#xa0;
defaultI would also like to touch on another factor since you are also looking to understand the competence of the in
defaultdustry as a whole.
default&#xa0;
defaultLet’s
default take the ECS scheme. Sounds great right? I am an approved electrician with the JIB and have an ECS card which states my grading as an approved electrician.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis surely means I am competent? 
default&#xa0;
defaultWrong. The JIB takes no account of 
defaultexperience and most importantly, your personal skill set.
default&#xa0;
defaultI have met plenty of JIB approved electricians who don’t understand basic electrical principles.
default&#xa0;
defaultMoving away from the Part P scheme I'd also say that recruitment agencies and employers use the JIB
default/ECS card scheme exclusively to evaluate ones competence to do the job.
default&#xa0;
defaultUseless. But then in an industry that is riddled with incompetence what else can we expect?
default&#xa0;
defaultThis industry has incompetent leaders and no back bone or frame work to really create an e
defaultnvironment of excellence. I hope you can take a long hard look
default at things and come up with some positive changes but I won't be expecting any radical changes because in my view this country’s
default leaders as a whole are weak and incompetent and that just feeds d
defaultown through the entire system.
default&#xa0;
defaultGood Luck!
