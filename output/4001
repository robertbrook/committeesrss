[normal]Submission from [bold]Safe Install Electrical Solutions[bold]&#xa0;[bold]My Background and my viewpoint of the industry as a whole
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am 29 years old and after serving in the armed forces for five years with distinction I decided to leave and become an electrician. That was in 2006 and ever since then I
[normal] have utilised my personal skill set and my armed forces experience to work towards the goal of  becoming a business leader and starting my own venture.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I felt it very important that I first become an expert in my field. However I wasn't prepared for just
[normal] how challenging becoming an electrical expert was. There are many specialisms in the electrical industry, technology is evolving rapidly and to gain experience in all of the specialisms is unrealistic.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What I am saying is to become a highly competent ele
[normal]ctrician is no easy task. I am about to achieve my Joint Industry Board Technician Status having sat my level 4 design qualification. (I studied very hard and believe I have passed the exam) 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I now have nearly eight years experience in the industry. I hav
[normal]e worked in the Nuclear and Solar industry as well as for companies such as National Grid, EDFE, Western Power and having worked on a whole range of projects from swimming pools, ASDA superstores, Nuclear Power plants and High Voltage Earthing. It has take
[normal]n eight years but only now would I feel any truth in saying, “I am highly competent.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Yet to become a member of these Part P scheme providers you only have to achieve your 17
[normal]th
[normal] Edition exam and pass two installation inspections. If you look on the various
[normal] forums around the internet, the forums are loaded with people who have just passed their 17
[normal]th
[normal] edition exam and are now looking to be told how to carry out two installs to pass the Part P compliance inspections from the NICEIC or Elecsa etc etc.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In my vie
[normal]w Part P is self defeating. It does absolutely nothing to improve electrical safety. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Let’s
[normal] look at a few other major problems.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Firstly, when a job has been completed that is required to be notified under the part p scheme, the only details required are t
[normal]he name and address of the customer as well as sticking a check box to indicate what type of work was carried out.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]So what we are allowing is under qualified people to carry out electrical design, installation and testing and then require no design or tes
[normal]ting parameters to be submitted for scrutiny by someone who does possess the required competence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In fact, Part P seems to be more of a licence for people who have no competence to easily gain accreditation and carry out dangerous and shoddy work legally.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have licensed the cowboys.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is a vicious cycle out there right now. That vicious cycle goes as follows:
[normal]Government creates legal licence for cowboys to operate
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Cowboy meets potential victim and does not have the design knowledge to price the 
[normal]job correctly to achieve a safe, compliant installation
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Customer decides to buy on price
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Electrician makes light bulb work
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Customer has no idea electrician has installed a potential fire risk due to incorrect design
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Customer has no idea metal light fit
[normal]ting has not been
[normal] earthed or the modified circuit does not meet other requirements such as disconnection times in the event of a fault
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Electrician is not required to submit design details
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Problem remains until either house burns down, house is sold and te
[normal]sted or customer is killed
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Highly competent electrician who priced the job correctly looses business and eventually goes bust or moves in to employment
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]General public are left with a mass of cowboys ready to serve with few quality electricians left
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I w
[normal]ould invite anyone of the committee to come and work with me for a two month period to experience firsthand
[normal] the effect this has on people’s
[normal] lives and the dangers out there that exist.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]You only have to look at the statistics for death, injury and fires cau
[normal]sed by electricity. I believe that if the system continues as it is these statistics will rise 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The biggest flaw of all is the fact that there is no mechanism to ensure that work is carried out properly. Time and time again I work for people who have jus
[normal]t bought a house. I test and inspect the house and find significant problems.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are too many vested interests and mortgage companies and estate agents are two massive culprits in my view.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I believe that there shouyld be a mechanism where before any 
[normal]house is sold, an independent third party electrical inspector should inspect the property and any defects taken off the price of the house.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]DIY home owners are getting away with carrying out dangerous electrical work on a massive scale. The problem is ex
[normal]acerbated by incompetent electricians, desperate for money who will then come in and sign off the work. Sometimes knowingly sometimes through sheer incompetence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I want to share one last story with you.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I was recently tasked with solving a customer’s
[normal] elec
[normal]trical problem. The problem was the young couple were experiencing blown light bulbs, up to 2 a day at times.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What I found was a trail of destruction. I believe what happened there (after speaking with the next door neighbour) was the home owner rewired t
[normal]he house himself.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This couple bought the house and thought the house wiring was fine because they had a Part P compliance certificate. Unfortunately a Napit engineer who had installed the consumer unit was clearly incompetent. I took one look at the test 
[normal]results and could not understand some of the data he had recorded.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]He had not carried out any proper testing or inspection, in fact
[normal] I believe he made the results up. There was no earthing on any of the Class 1 metal light fittings. What the previous owner 
[normal]had done was just unbelievable. There were bundles of wires which when I started to inspect, had conductors falling out of connector blocks. Not a single earth cable was sleeved
[normal] or connected to the metal light fittings.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This was just the tip of the iceber
[normal]g there and since starting my business two years ago, I am appalled at how weak the industry is in terms of ensuring a robust framework which sets out to increase electrical safety and promote the electrical industry in a positive way.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This is just the mo
[normal]st recent case and certainly not an isolated case. In fact I believe that as little as 10% or less of electrical installation work is compliant. And don’t think new houses are any different. I have worked on brand new houses with problems.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We are not Pain
[normal]ters and Decorators, we are not carpenters. Electricians should be highly skilled and competent people entrusted to deliver safe and robust installations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In terms of people being aware of Part P and what it’s
[normal] there for, I’d
[normal] say less than 2% of people
[normal] understand Part P with probably around 60% falling in to the I need
[normal] a certificate
[normal] category and the remainder just either not caring or knowing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I would also like to touch on another factor since you are also looking to understand the competence of the in
[normal]dustry as a whole.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Let’s
[normal] take the ECS scheme. Sounds great right? I am an approved electrician with the JIB and have an ECS card which states my grading as an approved electrician.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This surely means I am competent? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Wrong. The JIB takes no account of 
[normal]experience and most importantly, your personal skill set.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I have met plenty of JIB approved electricians who don’t understand basic electrical principles.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Moving away from the Part P scheme I'd also say that recruitment agencies and employers use the JIB
[normal]/ECS card scheme exclusively to evaluate ones competence to do the job.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Useless. But then in an industry that is riddled with incompetence what else can we expect?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This industry has incompetent leaders and no back bone or frame work to really create an e
[normal]nvironment of excellence. I hope you can take a long hard look
[normal] at things and come up with some positive changes but I won't be expecting any radical changes because in my view this country’s
[normal] leaders as a whole are weak and incompetent and that just feeds d
[normal]own through the entire system.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Good Luck!
