"&#xa0;\nWritten submission from Kevin Williams, Chair of the NAPIT Governing Board (BRC 57)&#xa0;\nI am writing in my capacity as the independent Chairman of the Governing Board of NAPIT, one of the competent person scheme operators. I am addressing only the \nquestion raised by the Select Committee regarding the adequacy of supervision of the schemes by DCLG, and my response has been agreed by the all the participants on the Board, which comprises:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Board acts as the “impartiality committee” as required by NAPIT’s accreditation and as such has a primary responsib\nility of holding NAPIT to account for its operations and to quote from our terms of reference:\n&#xa0;\nThe Governing Board shall:\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nassist in developing the policies relating to impartiality of its certification activities\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ncounteract any tendency on the part of the \nowners of a certification body to allow commercial or other considerations to prevent the consistent objective provision of certification activities\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nadvise on matters affecting confidence in certification, including openness and public perception\n&#xa0;\nWhile the\n question raises the adequacy of the Department’s supervision of schemes, I wish to draw attention to the effect of the Department’s decision to require schemes to become accredited to the international standard EN45011 which requires each scheme operator \nto put in place an “impartiality committee” such as NAPIT’s\n which must be \nrepresentative, \nindependent from the scheme operator, must have access to all information it feels necessary to hold the scheme operator to account\n. The impartiality committee\n has th\ne power to report the scheme operator to UKAS or the Department if the scheme operator does not takes its advice. \nI consider\n these \nto be \nquite powerful tools of scrutiny.\n&#xa0;\nDCLG’s terms of authorisation require UKAS accreditation by June 2014 so this element\n of scrutiny will not be in place for all scheme operators until that time\n.\n NAPIT’s Governing Board was formed in March 2009 and \nI \nbelieve has benefited NAPIT, the scheme members and consumers alike in that during that time we have had access and scrutiny \nin regards to many issues including:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe frequency of meetings and the topics covered on \nthe \nagenda are within the Board’\ns control;\n although NAPIT will \nalso \nsuggest issues that have arisen since the last meeting that they believe should be \nshared\n. \nThe board \nhave always been provided with the information we request, and \nit is \nconsider\ned\n the reports supplied by NAPIT have been open and complete in raising key issues. I believe that NAPIT have viewed the external scrutiny by UKAS and the Govern\ning Board in a constructive an\nd\n positive way and have sought improvements through our interactions.\n&#xa0;\nThe board \nhave from time to time, set specific actions for NAPIT to carry out to our satisfaction, or given advice for them to consider. To date we have been satisfied that NAPIT take action and appropriate account of our advice. The board have never had to use our \npower to raise concerns with UKAS or the Department.\n&#xa0;\nUKAS \nspend extensive \ntime carrying out surveillance on scheme operators, \nand \nI \ndraw your attention to the fact\n that in 2013 to date \nthe board \nhave seen reports that represent 17 person-days of UKAS time \nwith NAPIT both at the headquarters and witnessing NAPIT at work assessing scheme members, which far exceeds anything the Department was conducting prior to accreditation.\n&#xa0;\nI am aware that NAPIT have \ninvited\n DCLG \nto \njoin the Board \n(positively received by th\ne Department) \nwhich w\nill\n further improve this element of scrutiny\n.\n I would also note that \nthe board\n reviewed all the DCLG Conditions of \nAuthorisation\n and the implementation of these will give far more scrutiny than has been the case to date\n.\n \nT\nhe amount of \ninformation reported has been increased and the findings of UKAS are reported to the Department\n. \nThe board suggests that perhaps \nthe Department should consider taking a seat on the Governing Board for each scheme, or at least taking a report or minutes fro\nm the Governing Board of each scheme.\n&#xa0;\nTo conclude, I consider that UKAS accreditation and the formation of impartiality committees \n(or Governing Board) \nfor each scheme operator will significantly improve the \nscrutiny of the \nperformance of schemes. In NAPIT\n’s case accreditation and the Governing Board has been in place since 2009 and \nthis has resulted in a strong\n focus on improvement \nand compliance\n.\n \nThis \ngives us as a Board confidence in the scheme operation and which should therefore \nunderpin confidence at \na government level.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
