"Written evidence submitted by Bill Ritchie&#xa0;A programme of land reform should be seen as a means ofextending property rights including ownership, leasing and renting thereby tackling inequality;\nincreasing the participation of communities in decision making over land use policy and land use thereby\nstrengthening democracy;\nusing fiscal and taxation measures to promote specific outcomes thereby providing public benefits and delivering the Scottish Government's Land Use Strategy.\n&#xa0;\nLand value tax and land use taxcould provide powerful tools to guide land ownership and land use change, and provide a valuable and alternative source\n \nof revenue.\n&#xa0;\nReforming the law of successionto allow all children the right to inherit heritable and moveable property has the potential to create smaller\nparcels of land and increase the rate of land coming onto the market, especially very large rural land\nholdings, thereby accelerating land reform.\n&#xa0;Croftingis a secure tenure system for extending sustainable land use, creating diverse livelihoods and small scale\nlow intensity food and timber production. Measures should be introduced to:\nextend \ncrofting\n tenure to all parts of Scotland;\ncreate incentives for land owners to create new crofts;\ncreate planning guidelines for the creation of new croft housing where new crofts are established\ncreate a target of 10,000 new crofts by 2030;\nThe Scottish Government (SG) should lead the way by creating crofts, including woodland crofts, on SG\nowned land.\n&#xa0;Huttingcan allow the urban and rural population to benefit from Land Reform through access to land for\nrecreational occupation. Measures should be introduced to:\nprovide strong political support for the concept of hutting;\ncreate incentives to landowners to release land through sale or lease;\ncreate changes to the planning law to provide a definition of a hut and reform of the planning law;\ncreate changes to the building standards to develop a simple process for obtaining consent to construct huts;\ncreate a target of 1,000 new huts by 2020.\n&#xa0;Allotmentscan allow the urban population access to land for growing food and recreation. The SG should\nprovide strong political support for the expansion of allotments;\ncreate a target of 50,000 new urban allotments by 2030.\n&#xa0;The Land Reform Actis not working. Measures should be introduced to:\nsimplify and streamline the processes of the Land Reform Act (LRA);\nextended the scope of the LRA;\namend the LRAÂ  to allow access to the LRA and the Land Fund by properly constituted bodies set up with the purpose of establishing new crofts, small holdings and huts;\nsimilar amendments should be made to the \nthe\n National Forest Land Scheme .\n&#xa0;ResourcesThe Scottish Government should ensure that there are adequate resources including financial resources to drive forward a comprehensive land reform programme. A new body should be created to ensure effective delivery of the land reform programme.\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n"
