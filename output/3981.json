"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Friends of Radio 3 [FBB0025]&#xa0;\nFriends of Radio 3 (FoR3) is a l\nisteners’ group founded in 2003\n with the aim of raising with the BBC issues which concern like-minded Radio 3 listeners. \nWe have a range of interests, including classical music, jazz, world music, drama, arts and discussion, but our\n common interest is in preserving serious specialised a\nrts and music \nprogramming\n which we see as core to the BBC’s public service remit.\n \nWe have dealt with BBC management, the Governors and the Trust over \nthe past ten years\n. \nThere are\n 700-800 registered \nFoR3 \nsuppor\nters. \nW\nhen the BBC closed its online Radio 3 \nmessageboards in 2010\n for cost-cutting reasons\n we set up The Radio 3 Forum as a replacement for interested members of the public. It currently has just over 1,400 registered members\n, only slightly (approximately 10%) overlapping with the FoR3 supporters\n. \nWe \ninvited\n forum members to contribute and discuss views on the Inquiry \ntopics\n.\nWe strongly support the concept of public service broadcasting and the continuance of \nan independent \nBBC as the main provider. \n&#xa0;SUMMARY&#xa0;&#xa0;Q1. What should the BBC be for and what should be the purpose of public service broadcasting?1.1\n              \nThe \npurpose\n of a public service broadcaster should be to broadcast public service content, as defined by the Royal Charter and Agreement: it should not be formulated i\nn terms of specific responsibilities. \nWe note the House of Lords \nCommunications Committee’s \npublication  ‘\nPublic Service Broadcasting: short-term crisis, long-term\n future?\n’\n (2009) which \noutlined \nvarious \ndefinitions of public service broadcasting \nwhich shared \ncommon \nfeatures\n.\n1.2\n              \nA\n definition\n \ngaining support\n, \nthe Committee said,\n was \"\ncontent\n that the market does not sufficiently provide”\n.\n \nP\nossible examples of such\n \ncontent\n \nwould be \n “national and regional news, current affairs programmes, the arts, children's programming, programmes dealing with religion and other beliefs and UK content\". \n We support that\n interpretation of the core elements which we feel should form\n the basis of the BBC’s public service \ncontent\n.\n \n1.3\n              \nT\nhe Committee\n also\n \nstated\n: “\n[N]either Ofcom's nor the BBC's set of objectives is sufficiently discriminating to distinguish between those programmes and services that merit public finance and special \nregulatory treatment and those that do not. Few programmes screened by any UK broadcaster would not satisfy at least one of the objectives.” We suggest alternative objectives (§3.3 below).\n1.4\n              \nThe \n2006\n \nWhite Paper\n \ndifferentiated\n between \nthe\n “worthy”\n and the en\ntertaining.\n \nWe accept the point that the “worthy” should not be the sole type of content, but the choice of word is unfortunate (= “all very well in its way, but…”): the \ninformative and educational may well be entertaining, but that is not its primary purpose\n.\n It should be acknowledged that quality and distinctiveness alone do not give  BBC entertainment the right to be publicly funded: if that were the case, much commerci\nal entertainment would also merit such funding.    \nQ2. How well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period in achieving its mission and public purposes?2.1\n              \nIt is impossible to take an overview of all services but, regarding Radio 3,  it seems to\n us\n,\n as listeners\n,\n that financial cuts have \nbeen disproportionate, to the detriment of some \nquality of content. This may not apply across the board\n where funding has been maintained, or even increased\n. \n2.2\n              \nThe Agreement §7,\n ‘Promoting education and learni\nng’, states:\nIn developing (and reviewing) the purpose remit for promoting education and learning, the Trust must, amongst other things, seek to ensure that the\n BBC—\n&#xa0;\na) stimulates interest in, and knowledge of, a full range of subjects and issues through \ncontent that is accessible and can encourage either formal or informal\n \nlearning; and\n&#xa0;\nb) provides specialist educational content and accompanying material to facilitate learning at all levels and for all ages.\nHere, a) and b) above are not \neither/or\n but \nboth/and\n. If everything is ‘accessible’ to everyone, \nall levels \nare not catered for.\n The BBC has focused on making programming ‘accessible’, but p\neople who seek to deepen their knowledge of their special areas of interest have not been well catered for. \nTh\nis, and the BBC’s indiscriminate use of ‘interactivity’ – inappropriate for specialist services and programmes\n – trivialise content and contribute to the frequently expressed impression that the corporation is ‘dumbing down’ in an attempt to make all prog\nrammes appealing to all audiences.\n2.3\n              \nThere have been some complaints, which we would support, of BBC services copying commercial rivals,  contrary to §3.1.7 of the 2006 White Paper, and the Charter and Agreement. The Trust has been disinclined to respond\n.\n2.4\n              \nFreedom of Information: We have been dissatisfied with the BBC’s operation of its FOI derogation, nominally in respect of ‘journalism, art and literature’, but \ninterpreted as\n anything connected, however loosely, with programm\ne making\n and content. The\n dividing line between what was intended to fall\n, legitimately,\n outside the scope of the Act and the public interest \nin \ndisclosure\n \nseems to be a matter of BBC convenience. The appeals procedure is in practice too cumbersome\n to offer a remedy\n. \n2.5\n              \nWe are c\noncerned \nthat, n\notwithstanding the cost-efficiency argument, submission of regular reports and \naudience satisfaction surveys,\n the outsourcing of BBC Audience Services and \nComplaints to a private agency results in a service too remote from\n the BBC\n to provide satisfactory responses\n.\n  \n&#xa0;\nQ3. Are the public purposes in the current Charter the right ones? How might they change?              \n3.1\n              \nWe prefer the concept of ‘Public Service \nCommitments’\n, the BBC \nproviding\n specified content and services\n, not achieving vag\nue, unquantifiable outcomes (“Sustaining citizenship &amp;c”)\n3.2\n              \nIn particular, it\n should be \nclear that there is \nno implied \nobligation\n on the BBC to ‘deliver its purposes’ effectively by ‘reaching as many licence fee payers as possible’.\n This becomes a prete\nxt\n to focus on \nboosting \nratings \nwhich is not a healthy contribution to the market\n.\n3.3.\n              \nWe \nsacrifice the admirable succinctness of the Public Purposes to\n offer these expanded Commitments:\ni) To deliver international, national and local news in an accurate,\n balanced and impartial way; to provide informed analysis and a plurality of views to \npromote\n an intelligent understanding of UK society and world affairs\n, both to UK and world audiences  (through the World Service)\n. \nii) To provide a \nbroad \nrange of mainst\nream entertainment, from the UK and the world\n,\n to \nserve\n all ages\n; to provide\n cultural \nand educational programming at all levels, including\n specialised programmes \naimed at \nextend\ning\n tastes and interests, and\n deepen\ning\n knowledge\n and appreciation\n. \niv) To rec\nognise and provide for the needs and requirements of a demographically, culturally and geographically diverse public. \nv) To be mindful of the BBC's position in the ecology of UK broadcasting, not competing with what the commercial sector is already \nproviding.\nvi) \nTo be a leader in developing and using new technologies and new ways of delivering output for the benefit of the public.\n3.4\n              \nService licences should then \nrefine\n the special remits of \neach service\n.\n&#xa0;Q4. What scope, scale and remit should the BBC have?4.1 \n              \nThe BBC Trust’s introduction to the Director-General’s 2010 Strategy Review asked the Executive where the BBC’s focus and scale could be reduced “if necessary”. \n4.2\n \n              \nThe Executive response was contained in the section entitled ‘Doing fewer\n things better’\n which recommended prioritising some areas and recommending some \nservice closures (some of whic\nh materialised, others did not, demonstrating the difficulty of cutting services which audiences value greatly). It may be that some services, fo\nr example Radio 2, can afford to become more focused and specialist at the risk of losing audience (as the Trust implied).\n4.3\n \n              \nThe BBC is almost certainly larger than it needs to be, but this invites the question as to how large the BBC ‘needs to be’ to f\nulfil its mission. \nWe would welcome a better balance between the content  areas: information, education and entertainment, both in terms of broadcast hours and of funding (see 5.3 below). \n&#xa0;\nQ5 Should the BBC’s output and services be provided to any greater or lesser degree for particular audiences?5.1 \n              \nIt appears to be accepted that the BBC should devote the\n largest\n part of its resources to the services and output which appeal to the largest number of people (this has been stated by th\ne\n BBC \nTrust \nas\n “to \npr\notect the services that deliver the greatest value to large parts of the audience\n” – DQF proposals).\n \n5.2\n              \nHowever, that leave\ns\n many other ‘minority’ audiences – demographic, cultural, ethnic – who enjoy \nthe\n \nmainstream\n output to a \nmuch \nlesser degree\n,\n or possibly not at all. They will prefer content which – for a variety of  reasons – is not considered interesting, relevant or entertaining by the majority of the general public\n. Such audiences should be served adequately.\n5.3\n              \nWe think that ‘fair’ and ‘a\nppropriate’, having regard to what are considered core elements of public service broadcasting, are preferable to ‘proportionate’. In terms of television spend, 61% for BBC One, 22%  for BBC Two and 2.7% for BBC Four does not seem ‘fair’, ‘appropriate’ or \neven ‘proportionate’ for a public service broadcaster. BBC radio \nfunding is\n similar\nly discrepant\n, the service\n \nlicence spend of Radio 3 (\nthe only one of the five network stations to have\n no digital only ‘sister’ station) being the lowest of the BBC network \nstations\n, to cover what is arguably the most varied and expensive remit in terms of specialist musics and speech/arts programmes\n.\n5.4\n              \nWe object to the crude \ndemographic\n argument that ‘older listeners’ are overserved or at least adequately served. \nWe totall\ny support special children’s services, but in terms of separate, differentiated services, younger audiences (children and young adults) are, by comparison, well served in terms of both services and funding (CBeebies, CBBC, BBC Three, Radio 1, Radio 1Xtra, \nplus to an extent, the Asian Network and 6 Music). Adult audiences are overwhelmingly treated as ‘general audiences’ and anything ‘new’ or ‘serious’ is treated at an intellectually elementary (‘accessible’) level e.g. Radio 3 is more concerned to introduce\n new listeners to classical music than to cater for its existing music audience.\n&#xa0;\nQ6 What balance should be struck in what the BBC produces in-house, commissions externally and leaves entirely to others to provide?6.1\n              \nQuality, value for money and creative\n opportunities are clearly considerations but this is not of immediate relevance to audiences. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ7. How have the BBC’s commercial activities during the current Charter fitted with the BBC’s public purposes and have they achieved an adequate return for licence fee payers? What should be the aims, scope and scale of such activities beyond 2016?7.1\n              \nIt seems right that programmes which have been paid for by the licence fee payer should be marketed commercially in such a way as to provide a return which can\n be reinvested to fund further programming.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ.8  What role should the BBC play in developing technology and new ways of delivering output?8.1\n              \nThe BBC has traditionally played a leading role in developing new technologies. We believe it to be in the \nlicence fee payers’ interests that this should continue, delivering new opportunities to enjoy BBC content.\n8.2\n              \nThe BBC should stay at the forefront and maintain an understanding of the possibilities that are being developed elsewhere.\n&#xa0;\nQ 9. How should the BBC be funded beyond 2016?9.1\n              \nWe discussed four main possibilities: a) advertising\n revenue  \nb) subscription  \n   \nc)  TV licence fee  d) general taxation\n9.2\n              \nAdvertising was rejected for three reasons. Firstly, audiences appreciate a service without advert\nising and already complain about the amount of BBC on-air promotion. Secondly, the commercial imperatives of advertising would inevitably increase the pressure on programme makers always to appeal to the largest possible a\nudience, something we believe has \nalready become\n detrimental to the BBC’s core public service broadcasting. Thirdly,\n \nwe estimated that the amount of revenue needed to fund the BBC from advertising would begin to approach double the amount of advertising currently \nin evidence\n (\nin the region\n of £4\nbn\n p.a.\n \nfor television\n). The appearance of a giant such as the BBC \nwould\n have a\n colossal impact on the\n market\n.\n9.3\n              \nSubscription was not favoured because the detail \nwas hard to guess:\n \nwhether\n individual service\ns\n \nwould \nrequ\nire a separate subscription, \nhow they might be bundled,  h\now the orchestras and Proms \nwould be funded (\nif added to a service like Radio 3 that would make it impossibly unattractive to subscribers\n)\n.\n9.4\n              \nThe licence fee has served the BBC well over the years but the inescapable fact is \nthat it is an inherently regressive mechanism for raising funds, with the burden falling disproportionately on the poor\n/women\n who bear the brunt of \nprosecutions,\n fines and ultimately imprisonment if they cannot pay the fines.\n9.5\n              \nOne considered benefit of the licence fee has been the link between the fee  paid and programmes watched, but this becomes a disadvantage as people increasingly use subscription services or commercial services only. The fee they pay is \ntherefore \nlinked to \nBBC services which they do not use.\n9.6\n              \nFunding the BBC from general taxation has appeal: it is fair because\n it is\n  income-related; the mechanism for calculating and collecting the tax from individuals already exists; it avoids the need for – and expense o\nf – TV Licensing\n and its related responsibilities\n. \n&#xa0;Q10  Is there a case for distributing funding for public service content more widely beyond the BBC?10.1\n              \nYes. Public service content should be considered a \nvaluable\n ‘public good’\n, but it is expensive\n an\nd \nshould \nreceive public funding.\n&#xa0;\nQ11 What comparisons can be made with the provision of public service content in other countries?11.1\n              \nComparisons as regards standards and range of content will depend on what is being compared. However, with overseas rad\nio services now available online these are being \nincreasingly\n accessed via the internet by Radio 3 \nmusic \nlisteners\n who feel the BBC no longer serves their requirements\n. \n11.2\n              \nDiscussions on our public forum indicate that listeners are keen to recommend and\n to hear of recommended se\nrvices.\nQ12              How should the BBC be governed, regulated and held accountable beyond 2016?12.1\n              \nThe last government’s new model for the governance of the BBC  has been in operation for less than seven years. The Charter put in place \na new framework by which the BBC, especially the BBC Executive, could be held to account in the interests of the licence fee payer, the BBC Trust being the sovereign body charged with protecting the interests of the public.\n12.2\n              \nOur own experience relates \nmost closely to the way in which the new system of service licences and reviews (remits, content and editorial direction of the individual services) has been overseen by the Trust. \n12.3\n              \nThe Trust issues the service licences; approves update\ns, carries out \nservice reviews and\n public consultations\n,\n and approves management strategies. \nAt present the Trust seems both too remote to have sufficient knowledge and competence, and therefore too reliant on information from\n managers\n. That is a flaw of both the system \nand the individuals.\n12.4\n              \nT\nhere is notionally an official procedure for complaining about a Trust action or decision, \n but \nin practice this consists of submitting the details to the Director of the Trust\n Unit for an oracular adjudication\n \nwith\n no \ntransparen\nt procedure. Lord Grade has\n urged the appointment of a BBC ombudsman, a measure which we \nthink should be investigated.\nQ13 In a constantly evolving communications environment, does a 10-year Royal Charter and Agreement with the Secretary of State, together, provide the most appropriate constitutional framework for the BBC?13.1\n              \nIn principle, the Charter and Agreement seem appropriate. Whether ten years is the appropriate length of time might depend how far it is immutable from one 10-year period to the \nnext.\n It is in the interests of the BBC to have time to plan.\n13.2\n              \nT\nhe Secretary of State\n, for the Government, should also be bound by certain\n undertakings\n. T\nhe Agreement allows the Government to make significant changes\n during the life of each Charter\n. Th\ne 2006 Agreement, for example, states:\n “For the purposes of the World Service, the Foreign Secretary shall, in each year, pay to the BBC out of money provided by Parliament such sum as the Treasury may authorise.”\n  Yet the funding arrangements \ncould be\n ch\nanged in 2010.\n There could also have been a change in the funding for the over-75s’ licence fee.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nA public service for all: the BBC in the digital age\n, March 2006,\n §3.\n1.6: \n“\nEnter\ntainment is a vital part of the \nBBC’s mission. The Government sees no conflict between the new arrangements and entertainment. In line with the view of the special Lords Select Committee on Charter Review, we do not subscribe to the idea that \npublic service broadcasting should be confined to the “worthy”. Indeed, in most cases the BBC’s output will achieve its maximum impact only by entertaining its viewers and listeners.”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n“Jane Clancey, research account head for BBC audio and music, defended the commercial impact of the corporation's radio output. \nShe said the BBC's duty was to reach as many licence fee payers as possible.\n”\n \nhttp://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a95062/local-commercial-radio-audiences-suffer.html#ixzz2lCR8aReS\n \n&#xa0;\n \n“\nWhere if necessary\n could the BBC’s focus be \nnarrowed and its scale reduced?                    \n“After a period of successful year-on-year efficiency savings across the whole BBC, there now needs to be some \nradical thinking about either reducing the number/reach of services \nor in clarifying their boundaries to focus on some clear priorities.
