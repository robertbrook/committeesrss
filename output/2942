defaultWritten evidence from Heathrow (WRT 027)
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are grateful for the opportunity to respond to the Committee’s inquiry into winter resilience in transport. I hope this submission is helpful to the Committee and 
defaultI
default look forward to discussing this work in more detail during the oral evidence session lat
defaulter this month.
default&#xa0;
defaultResponding efficiently and effectively to extreme weather conditions is critical to our business and to the UK. Our customers and passengers are our priority and 
defaultHeathrow has robust and tested resilience plans in place for the upcoming wint
defaulter period. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBut
default, we are not complacent. We
default remain committed to
default learning the lessons of previous periods of 
defaultsevere
default weather, and
default an on-going programme of improvement in efficiency and resilience at the airport.
default This includes working hard in collaboration wi
defaultth airlines and the airport community to continually improve, test and implement our plans.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is impossible, of course, to eliminate entirely the risk of disruption at Heathrow. 
defaultAs airports around the world experience, extreme cold and snow will make som
defaulte level of disruption inevitable. In addition, a
defaults you know, the airport operates at around 99% capacity and there is little flexibility with two intensively used runways to close parts of the airfield for anti-icing or snow clearance without consequences.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, passengers and businesses rely on Heathrow every day and we work hard to minimise runway closure periods and to keep our operations running at maximum safe capacity whatever the conditions.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have detailed resilience plans during severe 
defaultweather events. They include:
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Snow Plan documents procedures for preparing and clearing of snow and anti-icing of runways, taxiways and aircraft parking stands at Heathrow. The 2013/14 plan has been created and agreed in collaboration with the airport community, including airlines,
default ground handlers and other on-airport businesses that each play a part in keeping the airport operating. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIncident Response Teams in each part of our business stand ready to deploy during periods of disruption, each with clear command and control objectiv
defaultes and recovery plans. These teams are exercised regularly and actively participate in evaluation toward a continuous improvement of our plans.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition, we hold Winter Resilience workshops with Heathrow staff and the wider airport businesses. These se
defaultssions outline the key elements of our plans, responsibilities in the event of an incident and how Heathrow’s command and control structure will co-ordinate this activity on both the airfield and the surrounding infrastructure. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOver the last few years, H
defaulteathrow has invested heavily in equipment, processes and training to better predict and respond to severe weather conditions. Over the last six months, we have invested in:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWe know that communicating effectively and quickly with passengers is essential and Heathrow has a dedicated Passenger Communications team that proactively use all traditional and social media to communicate and respond to passengers. This is in addition t
defaulto terminal-based information screens, signage and leaflets that explain to passengers their rights and how to access essential information and services. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTo facilitate this, Heathrow has worked closely with airlines to improve communication between our re
defaultspective operational teams. Heathrow also has a group of over 850 reservists and third party customer support staff who can be mobilised to assist passengers where airlines cannot. This includes providing essential welfare items (water, food etc.), use of 
defaulttelephones for local/international call and facilities to assist passengers with re-booking and accommodation.
