"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from IAM (Institute of Advanced Motorists) (WRT 016)&#xa0;\nThe IAM (Institute of Advanced Motorists) directly influences the driving and riding of more than 135,000 UK road users every year (full members, associates and commercial clients).  \n&#xa0;\nEstablished in 1956, the IAM is best known for the advanced driving test and the advanced driving course.  The IAM has grown to become the UK’s largest road safety charity, dedicated to raising driving standards, engaging with the road-using public and inf\nluencing road safety policy.  IAM Drive and Survive also provides a range of occupational driver training courses to the commercial market.  In January 2007, the IAM Policy and Research division was established to undertake consultation responses, campaign\ning and research to assist in the understanding of road safety issues.\n&#xa0;\nOur response is laid out below in the paragraph numbers supplied.\n&#xa0;Overview&#xa0;The IAM welcomes this independent review and believes\n \nthe vast majority of road users, householders and bus\ninesses would like to exercise their sense of personal responsibility when dealing with weather related issues.  The role of government, central and local, should be to allow them to make informed decisions and safely contribute to keeping the country movi\nng.\n In summary our key suggestions are;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.              UKRLG Review and its recommendations&#xa0;No \ncomment\n&#xa0;\n2.              The approach to winter resilience – highways&#xa0;2.1\n              \nWhat has been the experience of your authority, organisation of the winter 2009-10, and what are the lessons you have learned?  If you have conducted a formal review we would be pleased to see a\n copy\n.\n              \n              \nNot applicable\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nWhat has been your own practice about salt stocks, and your experience of the salt supply chain?  What views do you have about the operation of the Salt Cell?\n  \n&#xa0;\nThe IAM believes that a ‘just in time’ approach\n (\ni.e.\n only holding a 7 day reserve)\n to something as crucial as salt stocks is not appropriate.  Stock should be held to deal with extreme weather conditions even if this requires the provision of more storage facilities alongside the road network.\n \nWe r\necognise \nthat there is a holding cost but a full cost benefit analysis should be undertaken.\n&#xa0;\nSalt Cell\n should c\nome into play earlier based on forecast\ning\n and support local planning\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n              \nWhat action would you like to see taken by others – whether in relation to \nsalt supply and use or to other matters?\n \n&#xa0;\nThe IAM supports the provision of more local salt bins and salt supply points to allow d\nr\nivers to clear their own drives and local roads.  Salt should be freely available and supplied in suitable bagged containers\n. \n \nIt is not acceptable that salt is made available but often must be collected in your own container.  Salt bins at key locations should be replenished on a more frequent basis during periods of heavy use.\n&#xa0;\nT\nhe health and safety legislation \nsurrounding \nthe clearing of paths and roads \nmust be \nclarified. \n Many believe that by taking responsibility for clearing snow and ice they become liable to prosecution for any resulting injuries or accidents on the area that they have cleared. This is stopping communit\nies helping themselves. \n&#xa0;\n2.6\n              \nShould further action or powers be taken by central government or its agencies to assure salt supplies or winter resilience generally?\n  \n&#xa0;\nPrepare for the worst and have salt s\ntock levels \nto cover this so that \nsto\ncks don’t redu\nce\n to the levels they fell to last winter.  \nExisting\n powers, good planning and additional \ns\ntor\na\nge \nfacilities\n shou\nld \navoid the need for any \nadditional\n powers\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3.              Weather forecasting and communications - highways&#xa0;\n3.1\n              \nHow accurate have you found the \navailable short, medium and long term weather forecasting in predicting extreme winter weather, and how have you acted on the forecasts?\n              \n              \nSee below\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3\n.2\n              \nHow could the system be improved?\n   \n&#xa0;\nWeather forecasting is accurate but remains too \nhigh level\n to be useful in the very localised conditions found in many parts of the UK.  The general public should have free access to short term weather forecast and other ice condition information \n(such as ice alert temperature detectors) \nbeing used to inform grit\nting decision making.  The public pays for this information to be collected by public bodies and the IAM can see no reason why it should not be available in a suitably understandable graphic and standardised form on \nthe internet\n.  \nForecasting and road cond\nition information must be consistent no matter what the source – police, road operators, or Met office.\n&#xa0;\nPhase Two – maintaining winter transport service (all modes) and longer term issues4.              Resilience of rail services in severe winter weather&#xa0;No \ncomments\n&#xa0;5.              Resilience of airports and air services in severe winter weather&#xa0;No comments\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;6.              The consequences and economic impacts of severe winter weather &#xa0;6.1\n              \nHow does severe winter weather impact on critical aspects of people’s daily travel needs, \nand on the mobility of goods and services?  What lessons have been learned in business, public service and other organisations about forecasting and mitigating the transport effects of severe winter weather?  How effective have winter resilience measures b\neen, and what other measures should be taken?\n         \n&#xa0;\nIn our view last winter’s snow and ice had little \nprolonged \nor \nmajor economic impact.  \n&#xa0;\nBut, e\nxtended periods of snow and ice will almost certainly have \na high cost associated with it in terms of \ndisruption and lost productivity\n.  \nThe UK grinds to a halt at the first fall of snow and that is an unacceptable \noutcome\n.\n&#xa0;\nMore research is needed on the individual and societal costs of bad weather delays. \n \nUntil loss of earnings, damage to vehicles, cras\nhes and loss of output can be fully quantified by research we will not have a clear understanding of the costs and benefits involved\n.\n&#xa0;\nAny analysis should include the cost of \ndaily impact on travel, finding alternatives, if available, and the delays and di\nsruption caused by cancellations, traffic jams etc\n.\n&#xa0;\nCritical functions \nshould be prioritised \nsuch as daily care of the elderly, NHS patients, \nand heat\n and power \ngeneration. Over\n a prolonged period food production and distribution would assume more importa\nnce and priority.\n \n&#xa0;\nOrganisations must include bad weather issue\ns\n in their disaster recovery and Business Continuity planning.  Best practice guidelines should be prepared by leading trade associations for each sector and the Government should ensure they \nare widely disseminated and adopted including within the public sector.  The cascading of decisions to close offices, allow staff home or to remain at home is critical and should be teste\nd \nand updated on a regular basis\n in a similar way to fire or evacuation drills\n.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.2\n              \nWhat major areas of economic cost and benefit arise from the transport and travel aspects of: \n&#xa0;\n              \nMore research is needed in this area\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nbeing prepared for, and dealing with, severe winter weather?\n \n&#xa0;\nThe IAM believes that keeping traffic flowing is a key economic and safety function of road authorities and budget constraints should not have a part to play in winter maint\nenance decisions.  British drivers\n already pay\n \nsufficient tax on their motoring to \nfund a winter maintenance operation geared up to the worst conditions.\n  \n&#xa0;\nCurrent training offerings are focused on \n‘stopping’ but our experiences from the public is \nthat the main problem is actually \n‘how do we get going, \nhow to we keep going, \nshould we be\n travelling, what is the best method and how do we prepare ourselves and our vehicles’\n&#xa0;\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nfailure to deal adequately with such weather?\n        \n&#xa0;\nThe main costs of delays due to bad weather accrue to individual\ns,\n drivers and companies and more research is needed to better quantify them in relation to the expense of an up rated winter maintenance operation\n or proposals to fit different tyres etc.  The IAM can see no case for the \ncompulsory fitment of snow chain as \nour winter maintenance procedures are not based on driving on hard packed snow.  Winter tyres can offer extra traction but the ‘hassle and cost’ of changing tyres on a seasonal basis is too high for most occasional bad weather episodes.  The tyre industry \nshould continue to explore new rubber technology to \ngive its all year tyres more useful winter properties.\n&#xa0;\n6\n.3\n              \nDuring the recent winter weather large parts of the country experienced icy footpaths and icy conditions on minor roads for longer periods than \nusual.  What were the consequences of this, in terms of traffic accidents, higher-than-expected injuries due to slips and trips?  Should the public and local communities be able to take a more pro-active role (eg in clearing public and private paths and mi\nnor roads) and what issues are raised by this?\n        \n&#xa0;\nThe IAM has no information on injuries and the number of incidents.  \n&#xa0;\nMany local authorities actually met their published targets for snow clearance but the public as a whole have little understandin\ng of winter maintenance priorities and often felt helpless and abandoned.   \n&#xa0;\nCouncils must be more explicit on how long they will take to\n clear side roads and footpaths and what the priorities are and the ‘order’ of clearance\n.\n  \n&#xa0;\nPoor footpath clearance can lead to \npedestrian injuries, \nisolation and less inclination to attempt journeys which may actually be possible if main roads are accessible.  \n&#xa0;\nA\n \nnew approach which encourages m\nore personal responsibility for footpath cleaning \nby local residents/shopkeepers/businesses\n,\n combined with a higher priority for local salt bins and a clearer timetable of footpath clearance would be the most effective way forward.  Urban myths regarding the law on personal liability due to snow clearing \nshould be addressed as a matter of priority and local guidelines agreed and communicated to house holders and businesses.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.4\n              \nWhat can we learn from the experience of and approach taken by other nations who have similar weather to the UK, in terms of pla\nnning and managing winter resilience?\n                   \n&#xa0;\nThe UK climate is relatively unique.  \n&#xa0;\nThe latest developments in Ice alert, snow clearing equipment and chemicals should be monitored but the I\nA\nM is unaware of \nany \nnew thinking in winter maintenan\nce policy as a whole that would revolutionise our approach.  \nIn our view the most important area for technological advances would be techniques that do not require the passage of traffic to ‘work in’ salt and the ability to clear roads and deal with large \nnumbers of stranded motorists at the same time.\n&#xa0;\nRoad user behaviour in Scandinavia does suggest that additional training in dealing with ice and snow can lead to over confidence and a rise in serious collisions. \n&#xa0;\nQuick, reliable and personalised/localise\nd \ninformation\n in an often fast changing weather situation is the key.  Access to more CCTV cameras off the trunk road network would help to give real time information on what is actually happening at key pints on the network.\n&#xa0;\nAs a member of the \nF\nIA, the \nability to surv\ney motoring clubs across Europe\n we would be happy to do this as part of the winter resilience review.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7.              Communications and public expectations&#xa0;\n7.1\n              \nWhat can the public reasonably expect in terms of the winter resilience of roads and \ntransport services, and communication about this in severe weather?\n    \n&#xa0;\nThe public must \nbe allowed to \nexercise a high\ner\n degree of personal responsibility and \nbe \nencouraged to play a more positive part\n in the safe use of roads in the winter.  Information is the key and it is not yet tailored to the individual needs of drivers.  Blanket warnings about \n‘\nessential\n’\n journeys are of little value \nwithout a full definition of ‘essential’.\n  Highways authorities\n should actively encourage feedback from drivers on local trouble spots and micro climatic conditions.\n  The government should zero rate or exempt from VAT products directly linked to snow and ice clearance such as rock salt.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7.2\n              \nAre there ways of enablin\ng the public to be better prepared for future severe winters?\n       \n&#xa0;\nThe IAM does not believe that compulsory training in snow and ice driving is feasible, deliverable or would actually reduce delays or crashes.\n  Current training is geared to controlling \nskids or stopping safely as opposed to how to start on slippery roads, maintain momentum up hills or how to make informed decisions about which conditions make travel impossible.  \nHowever, p\nractical tips on how to cope with snow and ice can be useful and the IAM is well positioned \nand willing \nto deliver such advice through the media.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe IAM supports the idea of an informal ‘\ncontract\n’\n between dr\nivers and authorities \nto clarify each role and\n agree who should do what, by when and for who\nm\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFor example\n;\n&#xa0;\nDrivers could;\n&#xa0;\nHighway Authorities would agree to;\n&#xa0;\nDrivers make no distinction between road operators and one operator \n(\ne.g.\n the Highways Agency) \nsuggesting roads are open when local routes are still poor\n is \na recipe for \nconfusion and un\nnecessary trips.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nRoads will remain choked with traffic attempting to make what they see as their own \n‘\nessential\n’\n journey u\nntil drivers have access to comprehensive real time travel information, know what their employers policy is on stayi\nng away from work and can \nhave ‘trust’\n \nthat the \nauthorities \nare \ndoing their utmost to keep road\ns and pavements clear.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n8.              Long term weather trends8.1\n              \nRecognising the uncertainties and probabilistic nature of weather forecasting, what further information\n or assessment is available about the likely trends in UK winters – their nature, duration and severity - over the next 10-15 years.  And how might these most effectively be communicated to those who may need to act on them?\n&#xa0;\nMost climate commentators predict an increase in extreme \nand unpredictable \nweather events over the coming decades.  \nThe IAM would welcome a wider debate on extreme weather provision and \nthe \npolicy relating to it.\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n  \n&#xa0;\n"
