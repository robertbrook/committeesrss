"&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence from the London Assembly Transport Committee (CYS0050)&#xa0;&#xa0;I am writing, on behalf of the London Assembly Transport Committee, to \nprovide\n written\n information on cycling safety\n \nto inform the Transport Select Committ\nee’s oral evidence session on 2 December 2013. \n \n&#xa0;\nThis \nwritten \nsubmission \ndetails our relevant past work\n on cycling safety\n in relation to the \nthree \nspecific areas \nwhere the\n Transport Select Committee would like views\n: 1) whether cycling is safe\n, particular\nly in towns and cities\n; 2) what government can do to improve cycling safety; and 3) whether it would be desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from other road users. \nThe submission \nis\n mainly\n based on our\n report \nGearing\n Up? An\n \ninvestigation into safer\n cycling in London \n(November 2012\n)\n \nand a\n \nfull copy of \nthis \nreport is available \nonline\n at: \nhttp://www.london.gov.uk/mayor-assembly/london-assembly/publications/gearing-up\n \n&#xa0;\n1. Is cycling safe, particularly in towns and cities?&#xa0;\nIn our report \nGearing Up\n?\n,\n \nwe argued that,\n although cycling is increasing in London, safety \nremain\ns\n a\n cause for conc\nern.  D\nespite \nimprovements in the cyclist casu\nal\nty rate between 2001 and 2006, we identified that the \nrate across all types of casualty (slight, serious and fatal) \nworsened between 2007 and 2010.  \nAfter 2006 there was an \nincrease in the number of \ncyclist \ncasualties per million cycle journeys in London\n and the\n risk of injury to cyclists increased between 2007 and 2010. Moreover, T\nransport for London (\nTfL\n)\n failed to achieve its\n original\n target to improve cycle safety\n and \nsubsequently \nlowered its target. \n Ori\nginally \nTfL\n aimed to reduce the number of cyclists killed or seriously injured (KSI) by 50 per cent by 2010 compared to the 1994-98 average, but the actual reduction achieved was 18 per cent. \nTfL\n now has\n \na target to reduce all KSI casualties by 40 per cent\n \nby 2020 \ncompared to the 2005-09 average. \n&#xa0;\nWe found cyclist\n casualty \nrates in London compare\nd\n poorly to\n those in \nother cities where cycling ha\nd\n \nalso\n \nincreased\n. \nFor example, \nbetween\n 2001 and \n2010\n,\n New York recorded a drop of 72 per cent in the rate of cycl\nist KSIs\n in central Manhattan\n whereas in the same p\neriod in London the drop was 55 per cent on \nTfL’s\n road network. This is based on an increase in cycling of 255 per cent in New York and 160 per cent in London. \nElsewhere\n higher cycling rates have led to fe\nwer casualties. For example, in Copenhagen, as cycling grew by 50 per cent between 1995 and 2010 the risk of cycle casualties reduced four-fold. Although the Mayor believes the ‘safety in numbers’ effect will improve cycling safety in \nthe capital\n, we found\n this is not \nyet\n evident. \nWe, \ntherefore\n,\n concluded that it was\n imperative for the Mayor and \nTfL\n to make improving the safety of cyclists the top priority in all their cycling programmes.  \n&#xa0;\n2. What can government do to improve cycling safety?&#xa0;\nIn our report \nGearing Up?\n, \nwe made \nclear the role central, regional and local government \nbodies \nha\nve\n to play in improving\n cycling safety\n and encourage more cycling\n. \n We expressed our support for the Mayor’s aspiration to increase cycling but suggested that\n his \ntarget of 5 per cent cycling modal share by 2026 was too low and \nthat the\n upward cycling casualty trends could prevent more Londoners cycling. \n Indeed the \nMayor and \nTfL’s\n Cycle Safety Action Plan\n (2010) recognises\n \nthat \nconcern about \nsafety \nis\n both the\n most significant barrier for non-cyclists taking up cycling and stop\ns\n 10 per cent of existing cyclists cycling more.  We\n \nrecommended that the Mayor should establish a new target of 10 per cent cycling modal share by 2026 \nand \nappoint a Cycling Commissioner\n to champion cycling. \n We wanted the Cycling Commissioner to \npublish a biennial London Bicycle Account to inform Londoners \nof \nthe \nwork \ntaking place \nto improve cycle safety. \nWe also called for more\n invest\nment in \ncycling to shift it away from a transport opt\nion for the few\n,\n to a safe and attractive choice for all Londoners. \nWe \nrecommended that \nthe Mayor a\nnd\n \nTfL\n should\n:\n \nallocate at least £145 million to cycling in 2013/14 (the equivalent of 2 per cent of \nTfL’\ns\n 2012/13 budget); \ncom\nmit a minimum of £100 million \nto\n funding the\n Better\n Junction\ns\n \nReview (\nover the period of the review);\n \nand \nprovide at least £60 million (or 20 per cent of \nTfL\n cycling budget\n)\n to fund the\n Biking Borough Programme so it becomes an Outer London Cycling Fund\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n3. Would it be desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from other road users?&#xa0;In our report \nGearing Up\n?\n,\n \nwe concluded \neriod of the review), recommendations in four broad areas: 1) ndon \nal authorities have encouraged the provision of cy\nthere could, and should, be more segregated\n cycle space in London. Currently, decisions to give cyclists protected space are often turned down because there is a lack of political will to take space from motorised traffic. \nWe heard from \ncyclist \norganisations that cyclists should mix with other traf\nfic where possible, and be separated where necessary. Experts told us that any effort promoted as cycling improvement should give cyclists protected space.  We found the lack of protected space for cyclists on cycle superhighways continued to present risks\n. This echoed the findings from our earlier report \nPedal Power\n \n(November 2010) which found that users of the first two cycle superhighways were concerned about their safety. Around 60 per cent of over 1,000 cyclists who responded to our survey said they di\nd \nnot \nfeel safer \nwhen \nusing the \nfirst two \ncycle superhighways and two-thirds did not feel the\nse\n superhighways were respected by other road users. We \nrecommended the Mayor and \nTfL\n provide\n greater consistency in the measures along the \ncycle \nsuperhighways suc\nh as a uniform width, improvements to junctions and 20 mph speed limits on busy sections.\n&#xa0;\nIn our re\nport \nGearing \nUp?\n,\n we recommended the Mayor and \nTfL\n commit to introducing fundamental cycle safety improvements to\n the road\n junctions\n \nin their\n Better Junctions Review. \nThey should \nprioritise the removal of one-way gyratory systems and examin\ne\n the case for introducing 20 mph speed limits at junctions.  \nWe also\n recommended tha\nt the Department for Transport\n introduce legislative changes to traffic \nregulations to enable \nTfL\n to use new cycle safety solutions such as cyclist eye-level traffic signals. In addition to\n improving\n infrastructure, we \nwanted to see\n action\n taken\n to improve the interactions of cyclists with other road users especially HGVs.  We\n expressed support for the \nG\novernment and \nEuropean Union\n introduc\ning \nlegislation to increase the number of vehicles that are retrofitted with cyclist safety equipment such as side guards, close proximity c\nameras and visual aids. We \nalso recommended that th\ne\n Mayor and \nTf\nL\n work with the London Boroughs \nto \nmake HGV safety training a condition\n \nin planning consents and for \nTfL\n \nto do more with \nthe Metropolitan Police Service to tackle dangerous road use\n. This\n should include\n more\n enforcement activity along busy cy\ncle routes and at collision hotspots and improv\ning\n driver\ns’\n awareness through education campaigns.  \nIn addition, we called on the\n Department for Transport \nto \nexamine evidence from leading cycling countries about the costs and benefits of stricter responsib\nility and penalties against dangerous driving \nand \nthe\n Mayor and \nTfL\n \nto\n develop a plan to roll out cycle training across London\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nWe will be following up \nour\n work on cycling safety in London at our meeting on 10 December\n \n2013 \nwith representatives of the Ma\nyor, \nTfL\n and cycling organisations\n. In advance of the meeting, we have i\nnvited Londoners \nto contribute their views \nthrough an online survey which has \nalready \nattracted many responses.  \n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
