[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Evidence Submission: Home Affairs Select Committee Inquiry into [bold]Pursue [bold]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1
[normal]. 
[normal]The 
[normal]Pursue 
[normal]strand of the Government's counter
[normal]-
[normal]terrorism 
[normal](CT) 
[normal]strategy
[normal] 
[normal]CONTEST seeks to identify, 
[normal]investigate 
[normal]and disrupt terrorist attacks 
[normal]in 
[normal]this country
[normal] 
[normal]and against our interests overseas, and 
[normal]- 
[normal]wherever possible 
[normal]- 
[normal]to prosecute those
[normal] 
[normal]involved. 
[normal]This paper sets out in brief the key aspects of 
[normal]Pursue
[normal], 
[normal]considering the
[normal] 
[normal]structures within which 
[normal]Pursue 
[normal]is delivered; the powers 
[normal]in 
[normal]place to target and disrupt
[normal] 
[normal]terrorist activity
[normal]; 
[normal]the roles of o
[normal]r
[normal]ganisations such as the Charity Commission and
[normal] 
[normal]Financial Conduct Agency in tackling terrorist financing
[normal]; 
[normal]and the way in which the UK
[normal] 
[normal]co
[normal]-
[normal]operates with other countries and multilateral organisations 
[normal]to counter 
[normal]the threat.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]. 
[normal]Recent 
[normal]events 
[normal]in Woolwich and the attack against the Westgate shopping
[normal] 
[normal]mall in Nairobi, are a reminder that the threat the UK faces remains both serious and
[normal] 
[normal]sustained and that the nature of that threat is evolving and diversifying
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal]. 
[normal]The UK
[normal]'
[normal]s record on CT remains a strong one
[normal]. 
[normal]We continue 
[normal]successfully 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]disrupt attempted 
[normal]attacks 
[normal]against this country and its interests overseas. We are
[normal] 
[normal]becoming more successful at prosecuting and convicting individuals 
[normal]engaging 
[normal]in
[normal] 
[normal]terrorist activity
[normal]. 
[normal]We delivered a safe and secure Olympic and Paralympic Games in
[normal] 
[normal]2012
[normal]. 
[normal]And our CONTEST strategy, and the way we implement it
[normal], 
[normal]cont
[normal]i
[normal]nue to be held
[normal] 
[normal]up as examples of good practice around the world
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal]. 
[normal]Key to this success is our commitment to continuous improvement: we
[normal] 
[normal]regularly review our powers and capabilities to ensure they remain both effective and
[normal] 
[normal]proportionate
[normal]. 
[normal]A 
[normal]·
[normal]root-and-branch review of CT and security powers 
[normal]was 
[normal]an 
[normal]early
[normal] 
[normal]priority for this Government and led to considerable reform
[normal]; 
[normal]but monitoring 
[normal]and
[normal] 
[normal]evaluation is an ongoing process
[normal]. 
[normal]As we develop our powers and 
[normal]capabilities 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]meet new challenges, we will continue to ensure that we get the balance between
[normal] 
[normal]security and civil liberties right. Recent events have led to some debate about the
[normal] 
[normal]powers we have and the way we and our partners use them
[normal]. 
[normal]Whilst it is not 
[normal]the
[normal]Government's policy to comment on intelligence matters or leaked material, the
[normal] 
[normal]Committee will be aware that the Intelligence and Security Committee 
[normal](ISC) 
[normal]has
[normal] 
[normal]already published a report into allegations made by former US government
[normal] 
[normal]employee Edward Snowden, which found that GCHQ acted entirely properly
[normal]. 
[normal]In
[normal] 
[normal]respect of the detention of David Miranda
[normal], 
[normal]we await the report 
[normal]of 
[normal]David Anderson
[normal] 
[normal]QC, the Independent Reviewer of CT Legislation
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. Despite our 
[normal]successes, 
[normal]there is no room for complacency: the threat
[normal] 
[normal]continues to diversify both in terms of geography and methodology
[normal], 
[normal]and maintaining
[normal] 
[normal]current 
[normal]levels of assurance will be challenging 
[normal]. 
[normal]Whilst we still face a significant threat
[normal] 
[normal]from AI Qa'ida (AQ) in the border areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan, groups
[normal] 
[normal]affiliated or associated 
[normal]with 
[normal]AQ have become stronge
[normal]r 
[normal]and 
[normal]more 
[normal]active across 
[normal]a
[normal] 
[normal]range of unstable states
[normal], 
[normal]such as AI Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula 
[normal]in 
[normal]Yemen and
[normal] 
[normal]AI Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb in West Africa
[normal]. 
[normal]In Somalia
[normal], 
[normal]AI 
[normal]Shabaab 
[normal]remains
[normal] 
[normal]capable of mounting attacks throughout the country and against targets 
[normal]in 
[normal]the wider
[normal]region
[normal]. 
[normal]The conflict in Syria has drawn extremists on both sides
[normal]; 
[normal]whilst 
[normal]instability
[normal] 
[normal]across that 
[normal]region 
[normal]has provided new ungoverned spaces for terrorists to operate in
[normal].
[normal] [bold]Domestically
[normal],
[normal]. 
[normal]there has been a trend towards 'low signature
[normal]' 
[normal]terrorism by self-directed groups and lone actors
[normal]. 
[normal]These individuals or groups develop the intent and
[normal] 
[normal]capability to conduct attacks without support or direction from AQ or AQ-affiliates
[normal]. 
[normal]Of
[normal] 
[normal]similar concern
[normal]· 
[normal]are 'self
[normal]-
[normal]starters' who radicalise themselves over the internet and
[normal] 
[normal]plan attacks independently. Their attack methods tend to be simple
[normal], 
[normal]requiring little
[normal] 
[normal]money or technical ability
[normal], 
[normal]but detecting and disrupting such threats is a significant
[normal] 
[normal]challenge
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. To put these words in context
[normal], 
[normal]there have been six foiled terrorist plots in
[normal] 
[normal]Great Britain since April 2010
[normal]. 
[normal]Other terrorist incidents of note over this period
[normal] 
[normal]include the attempted murder of an MP by a student in May 2010 and the discovery
[normal] 
[normal]of printer cartridge bombs in transit at East Midlands airport in October 2010
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]However, attack plots represent just a small proportion of all terrorist activity in the
[normal] 
[normal]UK, and they tend to develop in groups already involved in terrorist facilitation.
[normal] 
[normal]Timely disruption of these groups has prevented further attack plans developing
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7
[normal]. 
[normal]Between April 2010 and March 2013, 580 individuals were arrested in Great
[normal] 
[normal]Britain for terrorism
[normal]-
[normal]related offences. The majority of arrests over this period (446)
[normal] 
[normal]were categorised by the police as international terrorism
[normal] 
[normal](77
[normal]°(
[normal]o), with 80 categorised
[normal] 
[normal]as domestic terrorism (14
[normal]%
[normal]) and 9 as Northern Ireland related terrorism
[normal]. 
[normal]The
[normal] 
[normal]number of arrests has increased in each of the past two years. In the most recent
[normal] 
[normal]year from April2012 to March 2013
[normal], 
[normal]the number of arrests increased by 21% to 249
[normal] 
[normal]from 206 in the previous year
[normal]. 
[normal]The longer term trend is fairly stable
[normal]: 
[normal]since 2002
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]there have been on average 210 arrests per year. It should be noted that the
[normal] 
[normal]relatively small number of terrorism
[normal]-
[normal]related arrests each year means that
[normal] 
[normal]proportionately large fluctuations in percentage terms are not uncommon
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8. Of the
[normal].
[normal]580 arrested between April 2010 and March 2013, 241 (42%) were
[normal] 
[normal]charged with an offence
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Of the total arrested
[normal], 
[normal]98 (17
[normal]%
[normal]) were charged with a
[normal] 
[normal]terrorism
[normal]-
[normal]related offence
[normal], 
[normal]of whom 35 (36%) were charged with preparation for
[normal] 
[normal]terrorist acts (Terrorism Act 2006, section 5)
[normal]. 
[normal]This has led to 64 people being
[normal] 
[normal]convicted of a terrorism-related offence so far
[normal]. 
[normal]Of these
[normal], 
[normal]31 (48%) were convicted of
[normal] 
[normal]preparation for terrorist acts (Terrorism Act 2006, section 5)
[normal]. 
[normal]Following a number of
[normal] 
[normal]trials relating to the most recent foiled plots
[normal], 
[normal]2012/13 saw a significant number of
[normal] 
[normal]individuals (13) convicted of preparation for terrorist acts. Since current records
[normal] 
[normal]began in September 2001 and March 2013, 64% of those charged with terrorism
[normal] 
[normal]related offences have been convicted
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]9
[normal]. 
[normal]As the threat changes
[normal], 
[normal]we will continue 
[normal].
[normal]to focus on improving our
[normal] 
[normal]understanding of the threat picture and maintaining our ability to disrupt and detect
[normal] 
[normal]terrorist plots
[normal]. 
[normal]No strategy can be 1 00
[normal]% 
[normal]effective in mitigating the threat
[normal], 
[normal]and th
[normal]e 
[normal]risk
[normal] 
[normal]of a successful attack is always present. Recent tragic ev
[normal]e
[normal]nts here and abroad have
[normal] 
[normal]only strengthened our resolve to do all we can to protect the public from those who
[normal] 
[normal]would do us harm, and we will continue to monitor
[normal], 
[normal]develop and ref
[normal]i
[normal]ne our powers
[normal] 
[normal]and capabilities to ensure they remain both effective against 
[normal]- 
[normal]and proportionate to -
[normal] 
[normal]the threat we face.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. [bold]Pursue [bold]Structures[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]10
[normal]. 
[normal]Ownership and governance of 
[normal]Pursue 
[normal]sit
[normal], 
[normal]like the rest of CONTEST
[normal], 
[normal]with the
[normal] 
[normal]Office of Security and Counter-Terrorism (OSCT) in the Home Office
[normal], 
[normal]but a wide
[normal] 
[normal]range of organisations and partners are responsible for contributing to the
[normal] 
[normal]development and delivery of 
[normal]Pursue 
[normal]policy. Whilst the police and the security and
[normal] 
[normal]intelligence agencies 
[normal]- 
[normal]the Security Service (MI5), Secret Intelligence Service (MI6)
[normal] 
[normal]and Government Communication Headquart
[normal]e
[normal]rs (GCHQ
[normal]) 
[normal]- are at the forefront of
[normal] 
[normal]operational delivery
[normal], 
[normal]a number of other Whitehall departments and their agencies
[normal] 
[normal]have important roles to
[normal]. 
[normal]play in 
[normal]Pursue, 
[normal]including the FCO
[normal], 
[normal]Cabinet Office
[normal], 
[normal]HM
[normal] 
[normal]Treasury and HMRC, along with other bodies such as the Charity Commission and
[normal] 
[normal]Financial Conduct Authority
[normal]. 
[normal]Close co-operation and dialogue between these
[normal] 
[normal]organisations
[normal], 
[normal]underpinned by common objectives and priorities
[normal], 
[normal]and effective
[normal] 
[normal]information and intelligence sharing
[normal], 
[normal]form the basis of suc
[normal]c
[normal]essful 
[normal]Pursue 
[normal]delivery
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11 
[normal]. 
[normal]The work of the 
[normal]security and intelligence agencies [bold]falls mainly within the
[normal] 
[normal]purview of the ISC
[normal]. 
[normal]These organisations play an important role in delivering and
[normal] 
[normal]supporting policy
[normal], 
[normal]judiciary and law enforcement partners alike in combating 
[normal]·
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]terrorist threat. On the operational side
[normal], 
[normal]the most important of these is the police.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12
[normal]. 
[normal]Policing [bold]is key to 
[normal]Pursue 
[normal]delivery in the UK
[normal], 
[normal]and whilst the Metropolitan
[normal] 
[normal]Police Service (MPS) plays a leading role in Great Britain
[normal], 
[normal]CT policing is delivered by
[normal] 
[normal]every police force in the
[normal]· 
[normal]country
[normal]. 
[normal]The national Polic
[normal]e 
[normal]CT Netwo
[normal]r
[normal]k comprises the
[normal] 
[normal]Counter-Terrorism Command (S015) within the MPS
[normal]; 
[normal]four Counter-Terrorism Units
[normal] 
[normal](CTUs) in the West Midlands
[normal], 
[normal]West Yorkshire, Greater Manchester and Thames
[normal] 
[normal]Valley; and Counter
[normal]-
[normal]Terrorism Intelligence Units (CTIUs
[normal]) 
[normal]in the East Midlands
[normal], 
[normal]South
[normal] 
[normal]West and Eastern regions
[normal], 
[normal]and Wales and Scotland
[normal]. 
[normal]Individual forces also have their
[normal] 
[normal]own Special Branch capability or equivalent.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13
[normal]. 
[normal]The police contribution to delivering CT is co-ordinated by an ACPO
[normal] 
[normal]committee - the ACPO (TAM) Board - using authority delegated by the Chief
[normal] 
[normal]Constables
[normal]' 
[normal]Council
[normal]; 
[normal]major CT investigations are co-ordinat
[normal]e
[normal]d a
[normal]c
[normal]ross force
[normal] 
[normal]boundaries by the Senior National Co-ordinator under a national agreement. Police
[normal] 
[normal]activity is funded by dedicated CT grants
[normal], 
[normal]the level of which is based on advice from
[normal] 
[normal]the police and 
[normal]·
[normal]the agencies
[normal]. 
[normal]Funding for CT policing has been protected since 2010
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]maintaining core capabilities
[normal], 
[normal]and as announced in the recent Spending Round
[normal], 
[normal]it will
[normal] 
[normal]continue to be ring-fenced until 2015
[normal]-
[normal]16. The intelligence agencies also received a
[normal] 
[normal]3.4
[normal]% 
[normal]increase in their combined budget for 2015
[normal]-
[normal]16
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14. A key aspect of police 
[normal]Pursue 
[normal]work focuses on protective security at 
[normal]ports[bold] [bold]and airports. [bold]The National Border Targeting Centre uses advance passenger
[normal] 
[normal]information to issue alerts to Special Branch officers at ports about subjects of
[normal] 
[normal]interest travelling to and from the UK, and 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]deny airlines authority to carry to the
[normal] 
[normal]UK individuals who pose a threat. These officers investigate people and goods
[normal] 
[normal]involved in terrorism to obtain intelligence, and make arrests where appropriate. 
[normal]·
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15. 
[normal]· 
[normal]The creation of the 
[normal]National Crime Agency [bold](NCA), which will be formally
[normal] 
[normal]established in October 2013, represents a significant change to the policing
[normal] 
[normal].
[normal]landscape. The NCA will lead work on serious, organised and complex crime,
[normal] 
[normal]including cyber crime and border security.
[normal]  
[normal]Once the agency is up and 
[normal]running 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]Government will consider what 
[normal]- 
[normal]if any - role, it should play in respect of CT. Until
[normal] 
[normal]then, the NCA will work with the Police CT Network on issues of. common interest.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16. Successful disruption and prosecution of terrorist suspects does 
[normal]not
[normal] 
[normal]necessarily eliminate the risk they pose, meaning partners such as the 
[normal]National[bold] [bold]Offender Management Service [bold](NOMS) are also vital to Pursue delivery
[normal]. 
[normal]NOMS
[normal] 
[normal]has a well
[normal]-
[normal]established intelligence infrastructure which identifies risk and threats
[normal] 
[normal]within prisons, from evidence of attack planning to radicalisation and recruitment
[normal] 
[normal]activity, and ensures that relevant intelligence is shared and jointly analysed with
[normal] 
[normal]partner agencies and the police to disrupt extremist activity. 
[normal]This 
[normal]includes informing
[normal] 
[normal]decisions about how and where high risk offenders are held, to developing
[normal] 
[normal]appropriate interventions to tackle extremism and radicalisation within prisons.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2. [bold]Counter-Terrorism [bold]&amp; [bold]Security Powers[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Prosecution[bold]17. The most effective way of dealing with terrorist suspects is to prosecute them
[normal] 
[normal]and, in the case of foreign nationals, subsequently to deport them. Responsibility for
[normal] 
[normal]prosecuting terrorism-related 
[normal]cases 
[normal]in Great Britain lies with the Special Crime and
[normal] 
[normal]Counter-Terrorism Division of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Suspected
[normal] 
[normal]terrorists are prosecuted for 
[normal]'
[normal]ordinary
[normal]' 
[normal]criminal offences as well 
[normal]as 
[normal]those provided for
[normal] 
[normal]by specific CT legislation
[normal]; 
[normal]many of those involved in serious terrorist 
[normal]activity 
[normal]are
[normal] 
[normal]prosecuted for offences based on the wider legal framework, most notably offences
[normal] 
[normal]such 
[normal]as 
[normal]conspiracy to murder. Last year, 43 people were charged with terrorism
[normal] 
[normal]related
[normal] 
[normal]offences in Great Britain, with 18 prosecuted and 16 convicted. A further 
[normal]24
[normal] 
[normal]were awaiting trial on 
[normal]31 
[normal]December 2012, with 2 individuals having been acquitted.
[normal] 
[normal]These figures represent a strong performance.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Disruption[bold]18
[normal]. 
[normal]While prosecution is always our preferred option, it is not always possible.
[normal] 
[normal]The first priority must be to protect the public; as such, the police often need to take
[normal] 
[normal]action to disrupt terrorist activity before they have be
[normal]e
[normal]n 
[normal]able 
[normal]to gather 
[normal]enough
[normal] 
[normal]evidence for a prosecution
[normal]. 
[normal]In other circumstances, 
[normal]a 
[normal]prosecution might not be
[normal] 
[normal]practical because information against the suspect is not admissible in court due to
[normal] 
[normal]. national security concerns 
[normal]- 
[normal]frequently, the need to 
[normal]protect 
[normal]our capabilities. 
[normal]For 
[normal]this
[normal] 
[normal]reason
[normal], 
[normal]other means of disrupting terrorist activity are necessary to address the
[normal] 
[normal]threat these individuals pose to public safety. Again, these measures are subject to
[normal] 
[normal]robust safeguards to ensure they are effective, proportionate and consistent with our
[normal]legal and human rights obligations. The main measures are as follows:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]• 
[normal]Terrorism Prevention[bold] and Investigation Measures (TPI[bold]Ms): [bold]Examined
[normal] 
[normal]extensively by the Committee in the past, the TPIM regime restricts the ability
[normal] 
[normal]of terrorist suspects to engage in terrorist-related activity, thus reducing the
[normal] 
[normal]risk they pose to the public. In his 2012 report
[normal], 
[normal]David Anderson QC concluded
[normal] 
[normal]that 
[normal]"so 
[normal]far TPIMS have been
[normal] effective in preventing terro
[normal]rist related activity
[normal]"
[normal].
[normal]• 
[normal]Exclusion: [bold]The Home Secretary has the power to exclude from the UK
[normal] 
[normal]individuals from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) whose presence
[normal] 
[normal]she does not consider 
[normal]'conducive 
[normal]to the public good.' Since January 2005,
[normal] 
[normal]442 people have been excluded from the UK
[normal], 
[normal]including on grounds of national
[normal] 
[normal]security (234) and unacceptable behaviour (extremism) (162)
[normal].
[normal]• 
[normal]Deprivation of citizenship: [bold]Since 2006 over 20 individuals who posed a 
[normal]real
[normal] 
[normal]national security threat to the UK have been deprived of their British
[normal] 
[normal]citizenship and either prevented from returning to the UK or removed from this
[normal] 
[normal]country. Deprivation of British citizenship results 
[normal]in 
[normal]simultaneous loss of the
[normal] 
[normal]right of abode in the United Kingdom and so paves the way
[normal], 
[normal]for possible
[normal] 
[normal]immigration detention, deportation or exclusion from the UK.
[normal]• 
[normal]Deportation with assurances (DWA): [bold]Deportation with assurances
[normal] 
[normal]agreements are an important component of CT co-operation with 
[normal]international
[normal] 
[normal]partners. They enable the UK to deport foreign nationals suspected of terrorist
[normal] 
[normal]activity in compliance with its obligations under human rights law. DWA
[normal] 
[normal]arrangements have been agreed with Jordan (to which the Government
[normal] 
[normal]recently succeeded in deporting Abu Qatada), Lebanon, Algeria
[normal],

[normal]• 
[normal]Royal Prerogative: [bold]The Government's ability to stop individuals from
[normal] 
[normal]travelling abroad to engage in terrorism-related activity has become
[normal] 
[normal]increasingly important with recent developments in Syria and other places of
[normal] 
[normal]concern. A range of measures are in place which 
[normal]can 
[normal]be used to disrupt such
[normal] 
[normal]travel
[normal], 
[normal]which include the Home Secretary
[normal]'s 
[normal]Royal Prerogative power to refuse
[normal] 
[normal]or withdraw a British passport on public interest grounds
[normal]. 
[normal]This is an important
[normal]tool to disrupt individuals who plan to 
[normal]engage 
[normal]in fighting, extremist activity or
[normal] 
[normal]terrorist training overseas and then return to the UK with those 
[normal]skills. 
[normal]New
[normal] 
[normal]powers to
[normal] search
[normal] 
[normal]for and seize passports cancelled by the Home Secretary
[normal] 
[normal]under the Royal Prerogative, as well as other invalid 
[normal]-
[normal]travel documents
[normal], 
[normal]have
[normal] 
[normal]been introduced into the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Preventative Measures[bold]19. As well as targeting individuals, an important element of 
[normal]Pursue 
[normal]is to disrupt
[normal] 
[normal]the activities 
[normal]of 
[normal]terrorist groups
[normal], 
[normal]including their recruitment and funding activities
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]• 
[normal]Proscription [bold]enables 
[normal]prosecution for membership 
[normal]a
[normal]nd other 
[normal]activities in
[normal] 
[normal]support 
[normal]of terrorist groups
[normal]; 
[normal]it 
[normal]also 
[normal]shows 
[normal]solidarity 
[normal]with international partners
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Proscription also facilitates other disruptions, including prosecutions and
[normal] 
[normal]immigration disruptions such as exclusion. In July 2013 Boko Haram and
[normal] 
[normal]Minbar Ansar Deen in Nigeria were proscribed, and the AI Nusrah Front in
[normal] 
[normal]Syria was recognised as an alias of AI Qa'ida.
[normal]• Working through the UN and EU
[normal], 
[normal]the UK also uses targeted international
[normal] 
[normal]sanctions [bold]against individuals and groups suspected of terrorist activity which
[normal] 
[normal]can severely restrict their ability to operate. In July 2013
[normal], 
[normal]after a sustained
[normal] 
[normal]period of UK lobbying
[normal], 
[normal]EU Foreign Ministers agreed to list Hizb
[normal]'
[normal]allah
[normal]'
[normal]s military
[normal] 
[normal]wing as a terrorist organisation
[normal]; 
[normal]and in the first half of 2013
[normal], 
[normal]the UK worked
[normal] 
[normal]with other Member States at the UN to ensure that the UN AI Qa
[normal]'
[normal]ida sanctions
[normal] 
[normal]regime reflected the emerging terrorist threats in north and west Africa
[normal]. 
[normal]The
[normal] 
[normal]restrictive measures imposed by CT sanctions include travel bans
[normal], 
[normal]arms
[normal] 
[normal]embargoes and asset freezes on designated individuals or entities
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Reviewing our powers[bold]20
[normal]. 
[normal]Ensuring our CT powers - and the legislation underpinning them 
[normal]–
[normal] remain
[normal] 
[normal]both effective and proportionate is a cornerstone of our strategy, one which reflects
[normal] 
[normal]our commitment to protecting the people of this country and our interests overseas in
[normal] 
[normal]a way which is consistent with British values
[normal], 
[normal]including transparency
[normal], 
[normal]human rights
[normal] 
[normal]and the rule of law. The Government's review of CT and security powers
[normal], 
[normal]published
[normal] 
[normal]in January 2011
[normal], 
[normal]made changes to the toolkit to make it more effective
[normal], 
[normal]targeted
[normal] 
[normal]and proportionate.
[normal]• We concluded that 
[normal]stop-and-search powers [bold]under Section 44 of the TACT
[normal] 
[normal]Terrorism Act 2000 must be repealed
[normal], 
[normal]and replaced them with a more limited
[normal] 
[normal]power which enables the police to stop and search people and vehicles
[normal] 
[normal]without reasonable suspicion only in exceptional circumstances where th
[normal]e
[normal]re is
[normal] 
[normal]a real threat of terrorist attack
[normal].
[normal]• We also reduced the maximum 
[normal]·
[normal]period of 
[normal]pre-charge detention [bold]from 28 to 14
[normal] 
[normal]days 
[normal]- 
[normal]though recognising that in exceptional circumstances a temporary
[normal] 
[normal]increase to a maximum of 28 days might be necessary, an emergency Bill has
[normal] 
[normal]been prepared as a contingency, subject to Parliament's approval.
[normal]• We also recently commenced 
[normal]post-charge questioning [bold]pow
[normal]e
[normal]rs in Great
[normal] 
[normal]Britain to enable terrorist susp
[normal]e
[normal]cts to be question
[normal]e
[normal]d after b
[normal]e
[normal]ing charged 
[normal]–
[normal] an
[normal] 
[normal]additional investigative tool for the police and prosecutors where further
[normal] 
[normal]evidence emerges after charges have been brought. The purpose is to allow
[normal] 
[normal]prosecutors to build more robust evidential cases
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]21. Evaluation of our powers is an ongoing process
[normal]. 
[normal]Schedule 7 [bold]of the Terrorism
[normal] 
[normal]Act 2000 enables police officers to stop, question
[normal], 
[normal]detain and sear
[normal]c
[normal]h p
[normal]e
[normal]ople
[normal] 
[normal]travelling through ports to d
[normal]e
[normal]t
[normal]e
[normal]rmin
[normal]e 
[normal]whether they are or hav
[normal]e 
[normal]be
[normal]e
[normal]n involved in
[normal] 
[normal]terrorism
[normal]. 
[normal]Schedule 7 confers an important CT power
[normal], 
[normal]but the Government
[normal] 
[normal]recognises there are concerns about its use
[normal]. 
[normal]We recently conducted an extensive
[normal] 
[normal]public consultation on Schedule 7
[normal]; 
[normal]amendments will be proposed in the Anti-Social
[normal] 
[normal]Behaviour
[normal], 
[normal]Crime 
[normal]&amp; 
[normal]Policing Bill, including reducing the maximum examination
[normal] 
[normal]period to six hours
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]22
[normal]. 
[normal]Recognising the need to protect intelligence and the capabiliti
[normal]e
[normal]s for gathering
[normal] 
[normal]it
[normal], 
[normal]we also introduced the 
[normal]Justice and Security Act[bold], [bold]which allows for closed material
[normal] 
[normal]proceedings in the small number of civil cases involving national se
[normal]c
[normal]urity sensitive
[normal] 
[normal]material
[normal]; 
[normal]and for judicial reviews of exclusion and deprivation decisions to be heard
[normal] 
[normal]by the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC
[normal])
[normal]. These measures have
[normal] 
[normal]equipped the courts better to handle sensitive materia
[normal]l 
[normal]to serve the interests of both
[normal] 
[normal]justice and national security
[normal], 
[normal]while allowing the Government to defend its case for
[normal] 
[normal]the use of these executive actions
[normal], 
[normal]even where decisions are based fully or partly on
[normal] 
[normal]material which cannot be disclosed in open court without damaging national security
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]23
[normal]. 
[normal]The Government also remains committed to ensuring that the law
[normal] 
[normal]enforcement and intelligence agencies have the powers they need to investigate
[normal] 
[normal]crime
[normal], 
[normal]protect the public and ensure our national security
[normal], 
[normal]including maintaining
[normal] 
[normal]access to communications data
[normal]. 
[normal]The Government's approach will be proportionate
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]with robust safeguards in place
[normal], 
[normal]but we cannot let cyberspace become a haven for
[normal] 
[normal]criminals and terrorists
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. Counter-Terrorist Finance[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]24
[normal]. 
[normal]The need to tackle terrorist financing is an important aspect of 
[normal]Pursue
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]terrorists need money to organise and conduct attacks, maintain their networks,
[normal] 
[normal]travel
[normal], 
[normal]and radi
[normal]c
[normal]alis
[normal]e 
[normal]and train others
[normal]. 
[normal]This is challenging
[normal]: 
[normal]the amounts of money
[normal] 
[normal]involved are often small and difficult to trace
[normal], 
[normal]and the means by which terrorists
[normal] 
[normal]raise
[normal], 
[normal]move and store money are diverse
[normal], 
[normal]ranging from abuse of charity to exploiting
[normal] 
[normal]weak regulatory environments to conducting kidnaps for ransom.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Banking [bold]&amp; [bold]Money Service Businesses[bold]25
[normal]. 
[normal]Terrorists use banks and money service businesses (MSBs) to move and
[normal] 
[normal]store funds; the 
[normal]Financial Conduct Authority [bold](FCA) and 
[normal]HMRC [bold]are therefore key
[normal] 
[normal]partners
[normal]. 
[normal]The FCA supervises banks
[normal]1 
[normal]compliance w
[normal]i
[normal]th the Money Laundering
[normal] 
[normal]Regulations and focuses on ensuring that banks have robust systems and controls 
[normal]i
[normal]n
[normal] 
[normal]place to 
[normal]·
[normal]prevent money laundering and highlight suspicious activity. HMRC
[normal] 
[normal]supervises money service businesses under the same regulations
[normal]; 
[normal]information
[normal] 
[normal]relating to terrorism is passed to law enforcement agencies
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Financial Action Task Force (FA[bold]TF)[bold]26
[normal]. 
[normal]Ensuring robust regulatory regimes in overseas jurisdictions is an important
[normal] 
[normal]dimension in countering terrorist finance
[normal]. 
[normal]The UK is a strong supporter and active
[normal] 
[normal]member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
[normal], 
[normal]which sets international
[normal] 
[normal]· 
[normal]standards for legal
[normal], 
[normal]regulatory and operational measures to 
[normal]c
[normal]ombat money
[normal] 
[normal]laundering and terrorist finance
[normal]. 
[normal]FATF conducts regular evaluations of countries
[normal]'
[normal] 
[normal]regimes and sets actions plans for those with def
[normal]i
[normal]ciencies
[normal]; 
[normal]high-risk jurisdictions
[normal] 
[normal]which do not take steps to improve their regimes can be 
[normal]'
[normal]g
[normal]r
[normal]ey
[normal]-
[normal]listed
[normal]' 
[normal]or 'black-listed
[normal]'
[normal] 
[normal]by FATF
[normal], 
[normal]which can limit investment and participation in international markets
[normal]. 
[normal]This
[normal] 
[normal]has produced tangible results
[normal]: 
[normal]Kuwait has recently taken significant steps to improve
[normal] 
[normal]its regime
[normal], 
[normal]including ratifying the Terrorist Finance Convention and enacting
[normal] 
[normal]legislation
[normal]; 
[normal]and both Kenya and Ethiopia have also introduced legislation due to
[normal] 
[normal]FATF pressure.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Charities[bold]27
[normal]. 
[normal]The conviction in February 2013 of three individuals for raising money for
[normal] 
[normal]terrorist purposes by posing as charity fundraisers
[normal], 
[normal]underl
[normal]i
[normal]ned the importance of the
[normal] 
[normal]role of the Charity Commission
[normal], 
[normal]the charity regulator in England and Wales
[normal], 
[normal]in
[normal] 
[normal]countering terrorism and extremism. Traditionally
[normal], 
[normal]the Commission has focused on
[normal] 
[normal]regulatory monitoring and compliance. We have been working closely with the
[normal] 
[normal]Commission and its new chair William Shawcross to look at how it can take a
[normal] 
[normal]tougher line with those who seek to abuse the sector for ter
[normal]r
[normal]orist purposes
[normal], 
[normal]including
[normal] 
[normal]through more effective and targeted use of its existing powers against charities of CT
[normal] 
[normal]concern. Where necessary we will seek to enhance those powers to improve th
[normal]e
[normal] 
[normal]Commission
[normal]'
[normal]s ability to regulate the sector as a whole
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]28. Working with the Home Office
[normal], 
[normal]law enforcement and other partners
[normal], 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]Commission has already increased the number of compliance visits it conducts into
[normal] 
[normal]charities of CT concern
[normal], 
[normal]both to identify and investigate abuse by terrorists and to
[normal] 
[normal]improve awareness of and increase resilience to such abuse
[normal]. 
[normal]As part of that
[normal] 
[normal]awareness
[normal]-
[normal]raising the Commission has published guidance to the sector on stopping
[normal] 
[normal]extremist speakers and monitoring charitable funds
[normal], 
[normal]including its successful 'Safer
[normal] 
[normal]Giving' campaigns
[normal]. 
[normal]More recently
[normal], 
[normal]it has run workshops on sending aid to Syria and
[normal] 
[normal]other high risk areas. Internationally, we will continue to work with the Commission
[normal] 
[normal]and other partners to improve its visibility of charities' activities - and of their financial
[normal] 
[normal]footprints- overseas
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. International Co-operation[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Bilateral and Multilateral Engagement[bold]29
[normal]. 
[normal]Many threats to the UK involve an international dimension
[normal], 
[normal]and the
[normal] 
[normal]diversification of the threat in recent years has made it ever more important that we
[normal] 
[normal]work with a wide range of countries to disrupt the threat to the UK and to build
[normal] 
[normal]capability to counter terrorism at source
[normal]. 
[normal]We work in close co
[normal]-
[normal]operation on both
[normal] 
[normal]policy and operational channels with our international counterparts in accordance
[normal] 
[normal]with our values, the rule of law and our own legal obligations
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]30
[normal]. 
[normal]Our most developed C
[normal]T relationships
[normal] 
[normal]are with our 
[normal]'
[normal]5 Eyes
[normal]' 
[normal]partners
[normal]: 
[normal]the US
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]Canada, Australia and New Zealand
[normal]. 
[normal]We have unique intelligenc
[normal]e 
[normal]relationships with
[normal] 
[normal]these countri
[normal]e
[normal]s and hold r
[normal]e
[normal]gular
[normal], 
[normal]detailed exchanges of views on CT pol
[normal]i
[normal]cy and
[normal] 
[normal]strategy issues
[normal]. 
[normal]We also have close relationships w
[normal]i
[normal]th European countries
[normal], 
[normal]both
[normal] 
[normal]bilaterally and through the European Union
[normal]. 
[normal]The UK is regarded as a source of
[normal] 
[normal]expertise on CT within Europe, and we work closely with 
[normal]E
[normal]U bodies (CT Coordinator,
[normal] 
[normal]Commission, Europol
[normal], 
[normal]External Action Service) and oth
[normal]e
[normal]r Member States
[normal] 
[normal]to set the direction for European CT activity
[normal]. 
[normal]The UK opt
[normal]-
[normal]out of Justic
[normal]e 
[normal]&amp; Hom
[normal]e
[normal] 
[normal]Affairs measures will not restrict our ability to co-operate fully with other European
[normal] 
[normal]countries to tackle terrorism
[normal]. 
[normal]We are also engaged in agreeing priorities and action
[normal] 
[normal]plans for the EU
[normal]'
[normal]s external work
[normal], 
[normal]notably in building capability in the security and
[normal] 
[normal]justice sectors in priority countries.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]31 
[normal]. 
[normal]The UK promotes greater international co
[normal]-
[normal]operation on CT 
[normal]through 
[normal]other
[normal] 
[normal]mult
[normal]ilateral
[normal] forums such as the G8 and the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum (GCTF).
[normal] 
[normal]This year's UK Presidency of the G8 focused on kidnap for ransom 
[normal]–
[normal] achieving
[normal] 
[normal]unequivocal rejection of the payment of terrorist ransoms - while the GCTF is
[normal] 
[normal]developing its work in the areas of rule of law and criminal justice capacity building,
[normal] 
[normal]including the establishment of an International Institute for Justice and the Rule of
[normal] 
[normal]Law (opening in 2014), which will t
[normal]r
[normal]ain legal practitioners to international standards.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Overseas Capacity-Building[bold]32. In 2013
[normal], 
[normal]the Government introduced a more strategic approach to its efforts to
[normal] 
[normal]develop the capacity of international partners to investigate and prosecute terrorists
[normal] 
[normal]by building justice and human rights partnerships with countries where there is both
[normal] a threat to UK secu
[normal]rity and weaknesses in the law enforcement, human rights and
[normal] 
[normal]criminal justice architecture. Supported by a £30m CT Programme Fund, these
[normal] 
[normal]partnerships include work to
[normal]:
[normal]• Build the CT capacity of overseas security services to improve compliance
[normal] 
[normal]with the law and human rights and to make them more effective;
[normal]• Improve the ability of loca
[normal]l investigators 
[normal]to build cases based on evidence
[normal] 
[normal]rather than confession
[normal]. 
[normal]The police CT network plays a critical role in this
[normal] 
[normal]regard
[normal]: 
[normal]support is delivered through the network of Counter-Terrorism and
[normal] 
[normal]Extremism Liaison Officers (CTELOs) posted overseas who work with
[normal] 
[normal]organisations in their host countries and regions;
[normal]• Ensure prosecutors and judges are capable of processing terrorism cases
[normal] 
[normal]through the court systems, effectively
[normal], 
[normal]fairly and in line with the rule of law
[normal];
[normal] 
[normal]• Improve and where appropriate monitor conditions in detention facilities so
[normal] 
[normal]that convicted terrorists can be held securely and their treatment meets with
[normal] 
[normal]international standards
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]33. Safeguards have been designed to ensure that this work is carried out within
[normal] 
[normal]a framework
[normal] built 
[normal]on accountability and respect for human rights; it is vital that our
[normal] 
[normal]CT work supports justice and the rule of law as well as meeting our security
[normal] 
[normal]objectives
[normal]. 
[normal]Although work on the partnerships is in its early stages, we have already
[normal] 
[normal]delivered progress in a range of areas
[normal], 
[normal]including the establishment of focused CT
[normal] 
[normal]prosecutor cadres in key countries, more effect
[normal]i
[normal]ve handling of CT cases through the
[normal] 
[normal]courts and improvements in CT investigators
[normal]' 
[normal]evidence gathering and forensics
[normal] 
[normal]skills.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Conclusion[bold]34
[normal]. 
[normal]The latest version of CONTEST considered what success in 
[normal]Pursue 
[normal]looked
[normal] 
[normal]like: effective disruption of terrorist-related activity in the UK and more prosecutions
[normal] 
[normal]or deportations of those responsible; reducing the threat from AI Qa
[normal]'
[normal]ida
[normal], 
[normal]its affiliates
[normal] 
[normal]and other organisations overseas, including disrupting attacks planned against the
[normal] 
[normal]UK
[normal]; 
[normal]and ensuring that our CT work is effective, proportionate and consistent with our
[normal] 
[normal]commitment to human rights
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]35
[normal]. 
[normal]Judged against these indicators
[normal], 
[normal]we are confident that our performance in
[normal] 
[normal]delivering 
[normal]Pursue 
[normal]has been and continues to be strong. However
[normal], 
[normal]as the threat
[normal] 
[normal]continues to diversify and originate from a wider geographical area
[normal], 
[normal]our ability to
[normal] 
[normal]detect and disrupt potential plots will become ever more challenging. We cannot
[normal] 
[normal]reduce the risk from terrorism to zero, but we will continue to work to disrupt those
[normal] 
[normal]suspected of terrorist activity in the UK
[normal]; 
[normal]to prosecute and convict them where we
[normal] 
[normal]can
[normal]; 
[normal]and where we cannot but they are foreign nation
[normal].
[normal]als
[normal], 
[normal]to take action to remove
[normal] 
[normal]them from the UK
[normal]. 
[normal]We do this by ensuring that our partners have a robust range of
[normal] 
[normal]powers which enable them to do their job and their work is integrated and coordinated
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]We keep our powers and capabilities under regular review to ensure that
[normal] 
[normal]they are effective and proportionate, and we are working ever more closely with
[normal] 
[normal]overseas partners and organisations to improve both their and our capabilities to
[normal] 
[normal]counter terrorism.
