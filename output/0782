defaultfrom within their own locality

default strategies for sharing patient information should be explored,
default specifically taking on the challenge of patient consent. Patients expect healthcare professionals to have all of the information necessary to make inform
defaulted decisions about their care, yet barriers remain that prevent the necessary transparency.

defaultIt was further observed that the present system of tariff payments provides secondary care diabetes specialists with a perverse incentive, encouraging them to treat simpler cases to maximise profit for their Trust, rather than focus on the more complex patients who require more attention and therefore more resource. 
defaultThe Think Tank agreed that in order to enable greater integration of care, the financial model needs to match the model of care that it is meant to deliver. It was suggested that if healthcare professionals were placed within an incentive system which encouraged joint working, the service would transform itself accordingly.
default Furthermore, there needs to be greater clarity as to the exact size of local diabetes budgets, and who is responsible for the allocation of funds across the entire integrated pathway. 
defaultIn addition to redressing the balance of incentives, it is imperative that Health and Wellbeing Boards place emphasis on the importance of integrated diabetes service provision in their Joint Strategic Needs Assessments (JSNAs). 
defaultThere are a number of integrated diabetes care models 
defaultworking successfully in the NHS including
default models in Derby, Portsmouth and North West London. However, it is important to note that there is no ‘one-size fits all’ model which commissioners should seek to deliver in every locality. The availability of a choice of models will be greatly desirable in providing a service tailored to the specific needs
