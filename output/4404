defaultWritten evidence submitted by The Motivation Charitable Trust default&#xa0;defaultExecutive Summary: defaultDisabled peopleâ€™s access to assistive devices is a human right recognized by the United Nations. However, for disabled individuals in the developing world, 
defaultassistive devices are often difficult to obtain, and
default,
default when they are available, inappropriate for both the user and the environment. 
defaultAn appropriate assistive device can dramatically improve the health and quality of life of the user, but an inappropriate on
defaulte can cause serious and potentially deadly medical complications. Despite this, assistive devices receive little attention from institutional development agencies. Furthermore, development projects
default are frequently designed without consideration of the needs
default of disabled people and as a result, disabled people are excluded and marginalized
default from much-needed programmes
default. The Department for International Development is called upon to adhere to international guidelines on disability, include both disabled people an
