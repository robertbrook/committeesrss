default&#xa0;defaultAndrew Hall – Written evidence default&#xa0;
defaultI am writing as a member of the public regarding the above bill, and would like to make the comments below.
default&#xa0;
defaultI would like to request that the Parliamentary Committee 
defaultscrutinising
default the bill include a specific piece of legislation within this bill, concerning the use of 'green lanes' in the countryside. Green lanes are usually unsealed tracks (
defaulteg
default not covered with tarmac or concrete), and used by a wide variety of traffic. Historically they were always open to all traffic - perfectly sensible in the days of horses and carts, but highly damaging when used by today's modern sports utility vehicles.
default&#xa0;
defaultMuch time, effort and expense is exercised by various bodies 
defaultwho
default are monitoring the situation. Where damage to green lanes by four wheeled recreational vehicles is evident, applications for Traffic Regulation Orders are made. Where the local authority grants such orders, the green lane in question has time to 'heal' - often with the help of volunteers to infill ruts and puddles created by the recreational vehicles. But sadly such TRO's are often temporary, and once expired, the damage by these vehicles starts again. As so the whole process is repeated.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is patently clear that these green lanes are not designed for the types of vehicle now using them. Current legislation means that the prevention of such vehicles using these lanes is complicated by ‘red tape’. I feel that this is exactly the type of situation where the Deregulation Bill could have a beneficial effect.  I endorse the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance's proposal that:
default&#xa0;
defaultAll unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs), and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs) should be recognised as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be re-classified as Restricted Byways.
default&#xa0;
defaultSecondly, requests for Traffic Regulation Orders on green lanes can be turned down by local authorities, with no right of appeal by the applicant. This can be despite overwhelming evidence that the lanes are being irreparably damaged. The Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance 
defaultare
default additionally proposing that: 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen a local authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order that is widely-supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector, or a magistrate.
default&#xa0;
defaultI am a regular user of green lanes in the Yorkshire Dales and the Derbyshire Peak District, and have 
defaultmyself
default had to climb along the sides of dry stone walls to avoid the mud and deep potholes caused by motor vehicles. I have seen horse riders having to turn back simply because their passage is blocked by such damage. Restrictions on the use of green lanes are certainly beneficial to their wellbeing, but all the good that temporary TRO's do can be undone again within days, when they expire, and the damaging vehicles are allowed back.
default&#xa0;
defaultI believe that facilitating the preservation of our unspoilt countryside is an area where the Deregulation Bill could have a significant - and popular - effect.
default&#xa0;
defaultI fully support the formal submissions, which have been submitted to the scrutiny committee, by 
defaultThe Green Lanes Environmental Action Group (GLEAM), by the Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG), by the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA), and the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance (YDGLA).
