defaultWe are a membership organisation with over 10,000 members who are blind, partially sighted or the friends and family of people with sight loss. 80 per cent of our Trustees and Assembly Members are blind or partially sighted. We encourage members to be involved in our work and regularly consult with them on government policy and their ideas for change.

defaultCurrent management issuesdefault: 
defaultL
defaultate diagnosis
default of glaucoma is a particular problem and
default is often due to the fact that
default initial sight loss
default from glaucoma
default is generally undetected by patient
defaults
default unless it is well advanced
default. G
defaultlaucoma is nevertheless
default easily detected by an eye test
default, even before it causes sight loss, which should be taken every two years
default. 
default&#xa0;
default7.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPeople also “fall
default through the net” by having delayed or cancelled 
defaultcheck-up 
defaultappointments
default and lose sight as a result
default.
default We have found that well over half of eye clinics do not keep a track of how many glaucoma appointments are delayed or
default 
defaultcancelled.

default&#xa0;
default7.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPatients can also struggle to take their medication daily – sometimes they do not fully understand the need for medication or they may simply forget.
default&#xa0;
default7.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPatients may struggle to physically put the medication drops in, for example if they have arthritis. There is not always adequate care to help administer eye drops if patients struggle.

defaultuse of
default community initiativesdefault: capacity in eye clinics is reaching its limit.
default 
defaultGlaucoma “shared care” in the community has been trialled in a number of areas and shows that by monitoring glaucoma patients in the community instead of in a hospital setting it is possible to reduce capacity problems in eye hospitals. The College of Optometrists and The Royal College of Ophthalmologists have produced a review of these initiatives

defaultetween 5 and 10 per cent of all diabetics develop the sight threatening eye disease proliferative retinopathy. It is more common in people with type 1 diabetes than type 2. Sixty per cent of type 1 diabetics show some signs of proliferative disease after having diabetes for 30 years. 
default&#xa0;
default8.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCurrent management: defaultpatients are offered laser treatment for retinopathy and anti-VEGF injections for diabetic macular oedema. In addition l
defaultife-long control of blood-glucose level 
defaultdecreases the chances of developing retinopathy. 
default&#xa0;

defaultRick factorsdefault: t
defaulthe risk of developing diabetic retinopathy can be lowered w

defaultf detected early, with retinal screening, early access treatment can help save sight.
default 
defaultObesity should be recognised as having a link with sight loss. defaultObesity is linked to diabetes which can cause sight loss (see above). Obesity
default defaultis also a factor in AMD and cataracts.

defaultManagementdefault issuesdefault:default variation in screening:default defaultIn 2011–12, the
default screening
default service identified 2.59 million people with diabetes. 98.6% of these were offered screening, but only 80.9% per cent of those offered were screened. The uptake variation in England varies from 95% (highest PCT) to 66.7% (lowest PCT).
default 
default8.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLack of patient centred caredefault: Patients with diabetes struggle to balance their many health care appointments with work and family/childcare commitments and inevitably some appointments are missed. Health services should be designed around the patient so someone with diabetes can have their diabetic retinal screening, full eye examination and foot check all in one go - rather than three different appointments and visits to the hospital/optometry.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFrom 2010 to 2020, the nu

default9.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is increasing evidence that demand is not currently being met in eye clinics which means people are losing their sight unnecessarily.
default Problems will only increase unless the issue is tackled now. More eye conditions than ever are now treatable and this will increase in the future - coupled with the demands of an aging population eye care capacity must be addressed.
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default10.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEye Clinic Liaison Officers (ECLOs) are employees in an eye ward who offer a bridge between health and social care services to people with conditions such as glaucoma or diabetic eye disease. They can: offer information about how to manage the eye conditions, play a role in providing accessible information, signpost patients to appropriate rehabilitation services if they lose a significant amount of sight, talk through treatment options or diagnosis information and prevent patients "falling between the gaps" in the system if hospital appointments are cancelled.
default Secondary care doctors are not equipped with the time or training to confront mental health issues that arise as a consequence of their patient's ill health
default, but ECLOs are able to discuss wellbeing with patients
default.
default 
defaultRNIB recently published a report outlining the critical role that ECLOs play in patient care and this can be accessed at:

defaultLinking low vision services (commonly funded by local authorities and found in a hospital environment) provide aids and rehab services to people with sight loss.
default 
defaultLinking these services with counselling services has a significant impact on patient's independence, physiological outcomes, confidence and ability to socialise.
default default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default11.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPeople facing a disabling illness are much more likely to face mental health problems as well - especially those with sight loss.
default Yet the majority of people who are registered blind are told there is "nothing more that can be done", discharged from the hospital and left cope on their own.
default Linking low vision services (which provide aids and rehab services) with counselling services has a significant impact on patient's independence, physiological outcomes, confidence and ability to socialise.
default Linking services that already exist is a cost effective way to improve outcomes.

default&#xa0;
default12.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOlder people are the main users of the NHS and are much more likely than the general population to have sight loss in addition to another condition which will affect its management. Sight loss must be considered in the planning of NHS services if patients are to receive care centred around them.
default 
defaultThere are around two million people in the UK living with sight loss and that number is set to reach four million by 2050. Sight loss predominantly affects older people: one in 30 of the general population are living with sight loss - that figure rises to one in five people aged 75 and one in two people aged 90 and over are living with sight loss.
default 
default 
default13.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSight loss has a massive impact on a person’s ability to manage a long term
default condition
default and itself has a massive impact on health and wellbeing in general.
default 
defaultAs such, sight loss itself should be considered in light of its impact as a co-morbidity 
defaultwhich a
defaultffects long term conditions.
default 
default&#xa0;
default13.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs outlined below
default, people with sight loss
default who use the NHS face multiple barriers in the current system as sight loss is 
defaultoften 
defaultnot 
defaultconsidered or catered to even inside
default the immediate eye care setting:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default13.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPeople who have stroke, dementia or a learning disability can often have sight loss which is undiagnosed - which adds further difficulties to their treatment. 
default&#xa0;
default13.3.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPeople who have a stroke are more likely to have sight loss.
default 
default 
defaultHowever
default 
defaultRowe, a leading researcher in the field, noted that currently: Often staff on stroke teams do not refer 
defaultpatients for vision assessment because of a common misperception that little can be done to treat visual impairment following stroke
default&#xa0;
default13.3.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPeople with learning disabilities are ten times more likely to have eye problems than the general population but are less likely to receive timely and appropriate care.
default 
default&#xa0;
default13.3.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPeople with dementia and sight loss face everyday living problems caused by sight loss which are masked by and wrongly attributed to dementia. People with dementia can also develop vision problems as a result of their dementia. 
default750,000 people have dementia in the UK, most of whom are over 65 and around 1 in 7 of the over 65s is living with significant sight loss. By the age of 75 at least 2.5 per cent of people will have both conditions.
default&#xa0;
default13.3.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPatient convenience is patchy an
defaultd jeopardises care: see points 8.5.
default 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultAbout two million people have sight loss in the UK. 
defaultPeopl
defaulte can develop sight loss for a n
defaultumber of reasons. Wet Age related macular degeneration affects central vision and about 40,000 people per year develop wet AMD.
default In addition, a further 500,000 people are living with dry type untreatable AMD. 
defaultThis has a massive impact on a person’s general health and wellbeing, for example people with sight loss:
default&#xa0;
defaultAnalysis of the 
defaultUnderstanding Society and the Life Opportunities Survey
default reveals that: 
default&#xa0;
default14.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA significant proportion of sight loss is not treatable with medicines,
default but the effects of sight loss can nevertheless be decreased by following the learning of the social model of disability. NHS services need to consider the way they are modelled for people with sight loss. Making sure health services are geared up to facilitate people with sight loss and targeting public health messaging at hard to reach groups, like those with sight loss, will improve health outcomes. People with sight loss have a particular need to avoid 
defaultmultiple morbiditiesdefault which have a compound negative impact on health.
default&#xa0;
default14.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo take some practical examples: those with sight loss need information in a format they can access such as large print, braille or by email or audio CD. People who cannot read their personal health information find it difficult to manage long and short term conditions, read appointment letters, or screening reminders; they are at a massive disadvantage.
default 
defaultThe majority of NHS computer systems do not record people's preferred format to receive information and therefore do not fulfil their legal duty to provide information in an accessible format 
default–
default and this must change.
default In addition, all NHS correspondence should be in 14 point print. 
default&#xa0;
default14.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHospitals and GP surgeries should be designed for people with sensory loss and linked long term conditions such as dementia so that visitors remain healthy and do not needlessly fall or injure themselves.
default 
defaultStudies have shown that fall rates can be reduced by up to 25 per cent if sight tests, assessment of daily hazards or modifications to the environment are carried out.
default 
default&#xa0;
default14.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNHS staff must to be trained in meeting the needs of people with sight loss 
default–
default for example in basic guiding or general awareness of the need to vocalise actions. Poorly trained staff is a very commonly cited barrier faced by people with sigh loss in the NHS.
