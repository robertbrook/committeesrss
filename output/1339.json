While noting that legal aid is still available for some private family law issues, the Committee is concerned that the Act conditions lega\nl aid upon proof of, inter alia, abuse for victims of violence, and that a proposed residency test is under consultation. It is also concerned at the introduction of court fees under the Employment Appeal Tribunal Fees Order 2013. The Committee notes with \nconcern reports that these limitations may push women, particularly ethnic minority women, into informal community arbitration systems, including faith-based tribunals, which are often not in conformity with the Convention.\n23.\n              The Committee urges the State party to:(a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnsure effective access by women to courts and tribunals, in particular women victims of violence;(b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nContinuously assess the impact of the reforms to legal aid on the protection of women’s rights; and(c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProtect women from informal community arbitration systems, particularly those which violate their rights under the Convention.”&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Paying for permission work in judicial review cases &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nRecommendations &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n21st\n August 2013\n1\n&#xa0;\n \nWomens\n’ Access to Justice: A \nresearch report\n, Rights of Women, 2011. \n \nIbid. \n \nConcluding observations on the seventh periodic report of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\n \nAdopted by the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women\n Committee at its fifty-\nfifth session (8-26 July 2013) CEDAW/C/GBR/CO/7. \n Rights of Women is a registered charity 1147913 and Company Limited by Guarantee. \n \nWomen\ns\n’ Access to Justice: A research report\n, Rights of Women, 2011.\n \nRights of Women’s response to the Ministry of Justice’s consultation, Transforming legal aid and \n&#xa0;Rights of Women's response to the Ministry of Justice's legal aid proposals 2011 Ibid\n A/RES/48/104\n \nThe Rule of Law\n, Tom Bingham, \nAllen Lane\n (2010) page 85. \n Ibid page 88. \n \nAirey\n v \nIreland\n [1979] ECHR 3\n \n \nSteel and Morris\n v\n \nUK\n  [2005] ECHR 103\n&#xa0;\n \nOpuz\n v Turkey\n [2009] (Application no. 33401/02)\n \npara\n 191\n \nSee for example, \nCEDAW General\n Recommendation No. 28, \npara\n 34\n. \n \nObservations of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women: The \nNetherlands\n, UN DOC CEDAW/C/NLD/CO/5, 5 February\n&#xa0;\n 2010.\n \nConcluding observations on the seventh \nperiodic report of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\n Adopted by the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women Committee at its fifty-fifth session (8-26 July 2013) CEDAW/C/GBR/CO/7.\n \nHuman Rights \nCommittee, General Comment No. 28, \npara\n 18.\n&#xa0;\n For further information see Rights of Women’s Domestic violence, immigration law and no recourse to public funds \nwww.rightsofwome\nn.org.uk/legal.php#domestic_sexual_violence\n. \n \nSee further \npages 11 and 12 of \n‘A Guide to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme 2012’\n published by the CICA in March 2013.\n&#xa0;\n Adopted by the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women Committee at its fifty-fifth session (8-26 July 2013) CEDAW/C/GBR/CO/7.\n"
