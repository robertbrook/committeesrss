[normal]The study showed that pathways without CCS would require exceptional levels of power from nuclear and 
[normal]renewables
[normal] – to support increased electrification of th
[normal]e heating and transport sectors. The development of low-carbon heat networks with CHP would soon become limited due to emissions constraints and 
[normal]the absence of 
[normal]CCS would have a significant impact on the potential for wide-scale roll-out of hydrogen 
[normal]as a fu
[normal]el source for
[normal] low-carbon heat.
