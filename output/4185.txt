[[[Written evidence submitted by The Industry Council for Research on Packaging and the Environment]]]

[[[ (INCPEN)]]]INCPEN is a research body established in 1974 to consider the environmental and social impacts of packaging. INCPEN members represent all stages of the supply chain. 

[[[Summary:]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[ It is INCPEN’s view that the proposed charge on carrier bags in England will have no beneficial impact on the environment. Worse, the proposed exemption for biodegradable bags will result in the closure of UK plastics reprocessing with consequent job losses.  It will also give a very confusing message to consumers. ]]]

[[[It will not reduce litter or save resources and will impact disproportionately on poorer people who have to use public transport and will still need bags to take their shopping home. ]]]

[[[Introducing a bag levy for no other reason than to address what some have described as ‘an iconic symbol of our consumer society’ is unjustified and ill advised. ]]]
