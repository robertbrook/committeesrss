[[[About NCVO ]]]NCVO champions and strengthens the voluntary sector, with over 10,000 members, from the largest charities to the smallest community organisations. Alongside our sister councils in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, we make sure the voluntary sector can do what it does best www.ncvo.org.uk. NCVO convenes the Public Service Delivery Network, a group of 2500 organisations that have an interest in public service delivery. NCVO also convenes a Special Interest Group (SIG) of sub-contractor organisations involved in the Work Programme, and a Payment-by-Results working group that will be making recommendations in late 2013.&#xa0;

[[[Summary ]]]&#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Government’s policy goals, as expressed in the Open Public Services white paper, are positive and could support more effective and open public services. &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However, at present, poor commissioning and procurement practice is hampering the Government’s ambitions. Ultimately, this will impact on the quality of public services. &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Public bodies are focussing on securing the cheapest price, rather than assessing value for money. This can exclude voluntary organisations and SMEs from public service delivery. &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Other barriers facing voluntary organisations include: inappropriate procurement approaches; larger contract sizes; short procurement timescales and disproportionate bidding requirements. &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Many VCSEs are unable to participate in payment-by-results (PbR) contracts because of the cash flow and working capital requirements to the detriment of market diversity and user experience. &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There is a lack of open and consistent data available, despite its importance for effective policy formation, driving improvements in procurement and securing better value for public money. &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Improving commissioning and procurement requires focussing on culture as much as procedure. Increased training and support for commissioners and procurement professionals will be vital if the government’s objectives to deliver better public services are to be achieved. &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Citizen-led delivery of public services relies on the trust and commitment of local communities, these communities are often mobilised around particular voluntary or community groups; if properly supported these groups can provide a route for more effective services. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Q2. What evidence is there that citizen-centred approaches to public service design, delivery and choice of provider can deliver better outcomes—ensuring not only better value for money, but also greater social, economic and environmental value?]]]

[[[Q5. How successful have the Government’s reforms been in opening up public services to grassroots community groups, rather than to large private or third sector organisations?]]]

[[[5]]] A recent Public Administration Select Committee report into government procurement found that civil servants often lack an understanding about how to gather requirements, evaluate supplier capabilities, evaluate relationships or specify outcomes when procuring services and goods. &#xa0;Procurement approaches &#xa0;Source: NCVO public services and procurement survey 2013 &#xa0;&#xa0;________________________

[[[16]]] A cost benefit analysis of one area found that with every £1 invested a return of £4.44 was achieved. When the benefits of improving quality of life are included, a return of £14.07 is gained for every £1 invested.

[[[18]]] The New Economics Foundation’s (NEF) report Doing Services Differently shows how some local authorities and providers are delivering better services by working in partnership with disabled people and disabled people’s organisations http://www.neweconomics.org/publications/entry/doing-services-differently. 

[[[19]]] Large contracts excluding the VCS have been most visible in the Government’s flagship Work Programme. Organisations wishing to deliver one of 40 prime contracts had to display an annual turnover of at least £20 million and the financial capacity to deliver large contracts that require significant cash-flow. Consequently only three charities now act as a prime contractor. The 21 prime contracts for the MoJ’s ‘Transforming Rehabilitation’ expects organisations to have an annual turnover of between £6-36 million. That said, the effectiveness of large contracts at the local level is unclear20 and many charities are unable to access the capital needed for these larger scale contracts, resulting in a diminution of local knowledge and expertise 21,22,23. Large contracts can also create unnecessary layers of management and increased costs, as primes take a significant cut of contract value24. &#xa0;&#xa0;Social value &#xa0;&#xa0;Source: NCVO public services and procurement survey 2013 ________________________

[[[21]]] A 2013 VCSE survey by Locality found that 42% of respondents believe contracts have become larger in the last five years and a further 52% expect them to become larger still over the next five years. 80% said this would provide them with less opportunities and a lower range and quality of services in their area. 

[[[22]]] A recent NCVO survey found that 23 out of 46 respondents said the scale of contracts has prevented their organisation bidding for work. One respondent noted how a county council have moved to county wide contracts rather than local ones, and that this has opened up the market to national providers to the detriment of local organisations. The full survey results can be provided on request. 

[[[23]]] The Federation of Small Businesses points out that the UK has amongst the largest average contract values in the EU. In France and Germany, with larger populations and similar size economies, average contract sizes are significantly smaller http://www.fsb.org.uk/policy/rpu/scotland/assets/publi_spec_procurabridjuly2012.pdf 

[[[24]]] An NCVO report The Work Programme – Perceptions and Experiences of the Voluntary Sector identifies management fees of between 15-20 percent http://www.ncvo.org.uk/images/documents/practical_support/public_services/SIG%20survey%202012%20report.pdf 25 Ibid 

[[[26]]] A recent NPC report highlighted a case in Bradford where the City Council had reduced the number of homelessness services providers from 11 to 4, and required providers to demonstrate their financial strength while squeezing pricing. As a result, fewer VCS organisations bid for the contracts. http://www.thinknpc.org/publications/governance-in-the-new-commissioning-landscape/ 

[[[27]]] A recent survey by Compact Voice found that almost 90 percent of voluntary sector respondents believe that public bodies will still focus on lower cost rather than social value when funding http://www.compactvoice.org.uk/blogs/compact-voice/2013/08/07/local-compact-survey-results-2013-briefing-3-social-value 

[[[28]]] From NCVO members in two recent surveys. Also feedback from Compact Voice, the NCVO Public Services Delivery Network and other voluntary sector partners. 

[[[29]]] One NCVO member reports how four years ago a public health body let a smoking cessation contract where the contract specification was 80 percent quality and 20 percent price. This year the contract was re-let at 60 percent price, 40 percent quality. 

[[[30]]] Good practice does exist. For its Café West Tender, York City Council held a number of events where they engaged with potential providers to discuss how social value should be built into the specification of the contact. Items in the specification included employing local people, working with people with disabilities and creating employment pathways. &#xa0;&#xa0;Data &#xa0;&#xa0;Recommendations&#xa0;&#xa0;

Greater Manchester is looking to reduce the number of people on out of work benefits by 22%, delivering annual savings of £500 million.

[[[41]]] An NCVO survey of VCSE experience of the Work Programme found that 70 of respondents feared their contracts would not be viable for the full term, and nearly half of the respondents were subsidising their service delivery with their own reserves. 

[[[42]]] A Compact Voice survey has found that 42% of VCSE respondents believe that the financial risks and capital requirements involved in PbR ‘completely’ limit their ability to compete. The survey also found that 87 and 82 percent of voluntary sector and local authority respondents respectively do not believe that PbR contracts will improve service quality http://www.compactvoice.org.uk/blogs/compact-voic e/2013/08/13/local-compact-survey-results-2013-payment-results 

[[[43]]] 22 out of 46 to a recent NCVO survey said PbR contracts have prevented their organisations from bidding for contracts. 

[[[44]]] NCVO’s survey of WP subcontractors found that 13 out of 98 have had to ‘park’ customers because the cost of the intervention exceeds the payment. The same research showed that 29 out of 98 respondents believed that prime contractors were inappropriately withholding clients (“creaming”). &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;________________________
