[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Does the Government have an effective strategy for forensic science in the UK and is it sufficient to support forensic science R&amp;D and criminal justice?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Did the FSS transition and closure run smoothly and within budget?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What impacts have the FSS’s closure had on (i) the criminal justice system and (ii) forensic science R&amp;D and training? In particular, have the appropriate quality standards and accreditation been rigorously maintained? (please provide evidence/examples)[bold]&#xa0;

[normal]What should be role of the Forensic Science Regulator?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What is the size of the forensics market and how stable is it?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]How are forensic science services procured by police forces and could procurement processes be improved?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Has the closure of the FSS resulted in a loss of intellectual wealth through its scientists leaving the forensic science profession, or the UK? (please provide evidence/examples)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]30 reporting officers (ROs) from 
[normal]the 
[normal]FSS London homicide team were TUPE’d to the MPS evidence recovery laboratory at Lambeth, together with approximately 70 examiners from the FSS homicide and sexual offences teams.  On face of it, this may be counted as them still being in forensic science profession, however the 30 ROs have effectively been deskilled by the operating model employed by the MPS – their new role is 
[normal]focused on the 
[normal]recover
[normal]y of
[normal] evidence rather than 
[normal]its evaluation.  These 30 ROs
[normal] are currently being trained to search items for blood and other body fluids and evidence types.  In the FSS these ROs, many of whom have 10-20 years of experience, carried out case evaluations and complex DNA interpretation as
[normal] 
[normal]well as file review (peer review of another scientist’s statement).  In the MPS model they are not 
[normal]able
[normal] to use the
[normal]ir
[normal] evaluation and DNA skills
[normal],
[normal] resulting in a great loss of skill to the CJS and those who hold these skills at other FSPs being given increasing workloads. The TUPE’d staff are 
[normal]currently
[normal] undergo
[normal]ing a long
[normal] training program 
[normal]which is progressing slowly, 
[normal]such that many are not yet signed off as competent to examine items themselves a year after transfer.  The same applies to file review – we understand that none of the 30 ROs are yet signed off to do MPS file review, something which many of them were highly skilled with in the FSS.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]For the FSS London ROs from the sexual offences team – at the present time the majority are still in forensic science.  This comprises 2 who became freelance consultants, one became a lecturer in forensic science and 12 went to other forensic providers (but largely on short term contracts) - however 4 of those 12 have 
[normal]recently
[normal] been made redundant 
[normal]by LGC
[normal].  In addition, 3 people left the profession
[normal];
[normal] others are considering doing so as they are now without jobs or very unhappy in their current roles.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Are current arrangements for the FSS’s archives satisfactory? How could arrangements for the retention of case files and forensic materials in the UK be improved?[bold]&#xa0;
