"&#xa0;\nWritten Evidence from the Police and Crime Commissioner for Suffolk [CST0048] &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCRIME STATISTICS&#xa0;\nThank you for your letter of 6 December 2013 and the re\nquest \nfor information on crime statistics.\n&#xa0;\nIn my Police and Crime Plan\n I have set 4 Police and Crime O\nbjectives which are underpinned by 14 performance measures.  The\nse measures will \nhelp \nindicate how well my objectives are being achieved.  The Chief Constable reports on performance against these measures to me at my bi-monthly Accountability and Performance Panel.  The measures are not targets per se but they are \none \nof\n the means by which I hold the Chief Constable to account for addressing performance.  I have attached a link to my Police and Crime Plan where you will see explained at pp27-29 the performance measures and the performance assessment framework.\n  \n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.suffolk-pcc.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Police-and-Crime-Plan-2013-2017.pdf\n&#xa0;\nClearly the veracity of crime recording data i\ns\n impor\ntant to me if I am going to \ngauge\n the levels of performance in my Force’s area.  \nIt will be no surprise therefore that\n I was concerned about recent statements \nmade elsewhere about\n the integrity of crime recording data\n.  \nI immediately requested the Chief Co\nnstable to reassure both myself and the public of Suffolk \nupon \ndata quality by reporting to my 5 December Accountability and Performance Panel.  I have attached the link to th\ne Chief Constable’s\n report for your information.\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.suffolk-pcc.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Crime-Data-Quality-Auditing Process.pdf\n&#xa0;\nI was pleased to note the detail of the processes set out\n in the report and to hear direct from the Chief Constable as to the strong audit regime in Suffolk backed up by strong leadership.\n  As a result\n,\n I am as satisfied as I reasonably can be as to the integrity of Suffolk’s crime data quality.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
