"VEP 0020\n&#xa0;\nWritten Submission by The Rt Hon David Davis MP, The Rt Hon Jack Straw MP and Dominic Raab MP VEP 0020&#xa0;The draft Bill&#xa0;(a)&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDisqualifying prisoners sentenced to 4 years or more in prison from voting&#xa0;Disqualifying only those prisoners serving four or more years would have the undesirable effect of enfranchising a substantial proportion of convicted prisoners.  \nAccording to figures from the Ministry of Justice, on\n 31 March 2013 there were 26,972\n \nconvicted \nadult\n British\n \nprisoners \nserving sentences of less than fou\nr years\n (excluding fine defaulters)\n; a f\nigure that represents almost a third (32.2%)\n of the total prison population.\nMany \nof those individuals sentenced to \nless than\n four years in prison\n \nare \nguilty of extremely serious and violent crimes.  T\nhey include \nthose \nconvicted \nof rape, robbery and \ncausing death by dangerous driving.\n  \nIt would be totally inappropriate to extend \nthe right to vote, during the period of their imprisonment, to individuals\n who have violated \nso seriously the rights of their fellow citizens\n.\n&#xa0;\n(b)&#xa0; \nDisqualifying prisoners sentenced to more than six months in prison from voting&#xa0;If only \nthose prisoners sentenced to more than six months in pris\non\n were disqualified from voting, this \nwould still enfranchise thousands of prisoners.\n \nAccording to figures from the Ministry of Justice, on 31 March 2013 there were 4,623 \nprisoners\n \n(excluding fine defaulters) \nse\nrving sentences of six months or\n less\n.  \nEven allowing for the foreign national prisoners in that group, the House of Commons Library has estimated that around 4,000 British prisoners would be enfranchised if the rules were changed in this way.\nAmong \nthe prisoners serving \nsix months \nor less \nin prison\n are those convicted of theft, assault and dr\nink driving.  If the offence committed is deemed sufficiently serious by a British judge to justify \nthe \ndecision to deprive\n the perpetrator of his or her liberty,\n even for a \nrelatively \nshort period, it is \nright that he or she is \nalso denied\n the civic right to vote for the duration of their imprisonment.\n&#xa0;\nThe \ncase law of the \nEuropean Court of Human Right is haphazard, but has gradually moved towards the enfranchisement of all prisoners.  It is unlikely to accept\n \na\nny\n \n‘\ncompromise\n solution’ such as\n disqualifying prisoners sentenced to more than six months in prison from voting.\n  In the case of \nFrodl –v- Austria\n \nthe European Court of Human Rights\n ruled \nunlawful the Austrian \nlaw \nban\nning \nprisoners \nfrom \nvoting if they had been sentenced to one year or more in prison.\n  \nTh\nis demonstrates\n that\n,\n i\nf the Government sets a\n fixed ‘length of sentence’ \nthreshold \nabove which prisoners automatically lose their right to vote, that law would risk being ruled incompatible \nwith the E\nuropean \nC\nonvention on \nH\numan \nR\nights\n (ECHR)\n.\n  In \nFrodl\n, the Court suggested that denial of the right to vote, as a sanction, had to be linked to the character of the crime, a qualification that would lead to the enfranchisement of all prisoners bar a small group such as those guilty of electoral fraud.\nIn addition, i\nf the Government did allow prisoners sentenced to less than six months to vote in elections, and this was deemed unlawful by judges in Strasbourg\n, the Government would have accepted the principle that \njudges of the European Court of Human Rights have\n the final say\n even on the minutiae of UK pen\nal policy\n, but c\nould \ncontinue to \nf\nace further demands \nfrom the Court \nto give \nthe vote\n to those prisoners who were still disqualified from voting\n, and further demands for compensation from British prisoners claiming that their rights were being breached. \n It is arguably the worst solution, sacrificing a key democratic principle, but leaving a high risk of future legal challenge in Strasbourg.\n&#xa0;\n(c)&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDisqualifying all prisoners serving custodial sentences from voting – a restatement of the existing ban&#xa0;In 2005 the European Court of Human Rights held\n, in the case of \nHirst v U\nnited \nK\ningdom\n,\n that the UK ban on prisoner voting\n \nviolated the right to free and fair elections in Article 3 \nof the Protocol to the E\nC\nHR\n.\n \n \nThe C\nourt reasoned that the ban was ‘disproportionate’, amounting to an automatic blanket ban on all\n convicted prisoners.\nSecond, the Court\n noted that UK prisoners are not informed in court, at sentencing, that they forfeit the ri\nght to vote.\n&#xa0;\nThird, the Court argued:\n‘...\nthere is no evidence that Parliame\nnt has ever sought to weigh the\ncompeting interests or to assess the p\nroportionality of a blanket ban\non the right of a convicted prisoner to vote .\n.. it cannot be said that\nthere \nwas any substantive debate by me\nmbers of the legislature on the\ncontinued justification \n… for maintaining such a general restriction ...’\nThe Court’s first argument, that \nthe current UK ban \non prisoner voting is \na\nn automatic \nblanket ban\n on all convicted prisoners, is factually incorrect.  The UK ban\n \ndoes not apply t\no prisoners on remand, \nn\nor to prisoners convicted for \ncontempt of court \nn\nor for\n default\ning on fines.\n  The Court is also incorrect to descr\nibe the ban on prisoner voting a\ns disproportionate.  Under the law as it stands, every prisoner over the age of 18 and who is a British national will regain the right to vote once he or she is released from prison.  The length of time for which each prisoner loses the vote is lost is therefore directly proportionate to the seriousness of the crime he or she has committed, as the length of the voting ban mirrors exactly the \nlength of the sentence served.\n&#xa0;\nThe \nCourt’s \nsecond \nargument, that UK prisoners are not informed in court, at sentencing, that they will lose the right to vote, can be addressed easily through a minor ch\nange to sentencing guidelines requiring judges to inform those given a custodial sentence that they will lose the right to vote for the duration of their imprisonment.  There is no need to lift the ban on prisoner voting in order to address this issue.\n&#xa0;\nThe Court’s third argument, that Parliament had not held a substantive discussion \non the issue of prisoner voting,\n was incorrect and ill-\nin\nformed at the time of their judgment.  The matter \nhad\n \nbeen\n dealt with by Parliament.  In 1999 the then Home Office Minister George Howarth led a working party on electoral procedures which, as part of its work, examined this issue in detail.  Following on from this review, in the year 2000, the legislation on prisoner voting was modified (under the Representation of the People Act 2000) to permit remand prisoners to vote.  Along with two consultations under the last Labour government, one in 2006 and the \nother in 2009, the matter\n was \nfurther \naddr\nessed on 10\n F\nebruary 2011, when an extensive \ndebate was held in the House of Commons\n. \nMembers of Parliament \nfrom all sides of the House \nvoted, by 234 votes to just 22\n, to retain the current ban on prisoner voting.\n  This emphatic statement of Parliament’s support for the \nstatus\n \nquo\n on prisoners’ voting rights should take precedence over the rulings of the European Court \nof Human Rights on this issue.\n \n&#xa0;\nAdditional Questions&#xa0;&#xa0;There are strong historical justifications for denying prisoners the vote.\n  \nBritish law has\n \nde jure\n restricted the voting rights o\nf \nprisoners \nsince the passing of the Forfeiture Act 1870\n. \nIn fact a ban of sorts\n had existed, \nde facto\n, since 1832 as the franchise \nduring that period was extended only\n to men \nwho owned land worth \nten pounds\n or more\n, while common law\n directed that felons forfeited their lands.\n  \nSince 1870\n, \nfour Representation of the People Acts - in 191\n8, 1\n969, 1983 and 2000 – have retained restrictions\n \non \nprisoners\n’\n \nright to vote\n.\nIn the case of \nHirst v UK\n the European Court of Human Rights held that the UK’s restrictions on prisoner voting were\n incompatible with the ECHR\n.  In fact, voting rights for prisoners were specifica\nlly excluded from the ECHR\n from the outset.  W\nhen British representatives were negotiating the text of the \nECHR\n in 1949\n, \nthe French proposed including \nin the document the right to vote by “universal suffrage”\n.  Britain expressly rejected this wording on the grounds that it was too vague, and could lead to the right to vote being given to those who were denied it under British law - including prisoners. \nAs UK delegate\n \nSir Oscar Dowso\nn told representatives from other European nations at the negotiations\n:\n&#xa0;\n“[i]\nn no State is the right to vote enjoyed even by c\nitizens without qualifications…\nit is our view that the variety of circumstances to be considered may justify the imposition of\n a variety of qualifications\n”\n&#xa0;\nI\nn Britain, \nthese qualifications included restrictions on the voting rights of \n“peers, \nfelons and lunatics”\n. \n The UK Government’s\n objection was accepted\n by those negotiating the \nECHR\n, and\n the phrase ‘universal suffrage’\n was \nspecifically and deliberately \nomitted from the Convention\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe philosophical justifications for denying prisoners the vote are clear.\n  \nIndividuals \nkeep\n most of their basic human righ\nts whilst serving a custodial sentence\n.  They retain the right to humane treatment, to be adequately fed and clothed.\nHowever, f\nor someone to receive a \ncustodial sentence in England, he or she has\n to have committed a serious crime. \n \nBy doing so, t\nhat person has\n broken their contract with society to such a serious extent th\nat they \nlose a number of rights\n;\n their liberty, their f\nreedom of association, and the\n right to vote.\n  When British voters elect \na government they choose the \nme\nn and women who will\n make laws on their behalf. \n \nConvicted prisoners should have no say in this\n; those who break the law should not\n make the law.\n&#xa0;\nThe prisoner voting debate raises important questions about where the authority of national parliaments ends and that of the European Court of Human Rights begins.  \nWhen Br\nitain \nsigned up to the ECHR\n, it was to help prevent a repeat o\nf the catastrophic devastation, unprecedented suffering and appalling\n \nhuman rights violations \ncaused by the Second World War.\n&#xa0;\nHowever, in \nTyrer v \nUnited Kingdom\n, judges in the European Court of \nH\numan \nR\nights\n adopted the view that the Convention was what it termed “\na living instrument\n”.  \nSimilarly, in  \nCossey v United Kingdom\n the Court stated that it had a duty to “\nensure that the interpretation of the Convention reflects societal changes and remains in line with present day conditions\n.” \nWhat that \nhas \nmeant in practice \ni\ns tha\nt the Court assumed \na legislative function fundamentally at odds with its judicial mandate\n.  It did so with no mandate from the Council of Europe member states.\n&#xa0;\nIt is not disputed that the European Court of Human Rights has authority to hear and make authoritative rulings relating to cases involving alleged breaches of fundamental human rights by governments within the Council of Europe.  However, the signatories to the ECHR would never have envisaged that the Court would attempt to interfere in the minutiae of an individual nation’s electoral \nand penal \nlaws, let alone try to overrule the clearly stated view of a national parliament on the issue.\n&#xa0;\nThis was the argument \nmade in \nthe dissenting judgment\ns\n in the case of \nHirst v UK\n.  Among those judges who dissented from the European Court of Human Rights’ judgment against the UK was the President of the Court, Judge Jean\n-Paul Costa.  In his judgment Judge Costa\n said:\n&#xa0;\n“\nWith due respect, I see no convincing arguments in the majorit\ny’s\nreasoning that could persuade m\ne that the measure to which the applicant\nwas subject was arbitrary, or\n even that it affected the free expression of\nthe opinion of the people\n...it is not for the Court to \nprescribe the way in which national legislatures \ncarry out their legislative functions. It must be assumed\nthat section\n 3 of the Representation of the \nPeople\n Act [2000] reflects political,\nsocial an\nd cultural values in the United \nKingdom\n.\n”\n&#xa0;\nThe European Court of Human Rights’ own case law allows member states a “margin of appreciati\non” which accepts the ECHR\n can be validly interpreted in different ways by different member states according to their own cultural, historical and philosophical traditions.\n&#xa0;\nAs Judge Costa \nadded in the conclusion of his dissenting judgment:\n&#xa0;\n“\nThe point is that one must avoid confusi\nng the ideal to be attained and which\nI support – which is to make every e\nffort to bring the isolation of convicted\nprisoners to an end, even when they have bee\nn convicted of the most serious\ncrimes, and to prepare for their reintegration into so\nciety and citizenship – and\nthe reality of Hirst (no. 2), which on the o\nne hand theoretically asserts a wide\nmargin of appreciation for the States as to the c\nonditions in which a subjective\nright (derived from judicial interpretation!) may be exercised, bu\nt goes on to\nhold \nthat there has been a violation of that right, the\nreby depriving the State of\nall \nmargin and all means of appreciation\n.\n”\n&#xa0;\nIn seeking to redefine the details of UK electoral and penal law, the European Court of Human Rights has exceeded its proper \njudicial \nauthority\n and set itself on course for a constitutional clash with the elected and accountable legislative bodies in the UK\n.\n  I\nf the Court insists on expanding its influence and eroding the margin of appreciation, Strasbourg judges will find themselves more frequently in direct opposition to national courts and parliaments. Democratic parliaments across Europe will find themselves, with increasing regularity, forced to choose between the will of their people and the views of foreign judges. \n&#xa0;\nFurthermore, \non good constitutional authority from senior judicial figures, \nit is legit\nimate for Parliament and UK\n courts to reject the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. \nLord Chief Justice Igor Judge used the 2010 annual Judicial Studies Board lecture to state that, although the decisions of the European Court of Justice bind UK courts, decisions of the\n Strasbourg court \ndo not.\n&#xa0;\n“\nAs a matter of statute the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights\ndo not bind our courts. The statutory obligation on our courts is to take account\nof the decisions of the court in Strasbourg...We can follow the reasoning and if possible identify and apply the principle to be found in these decisions,\nparticularly those of the Grand Chamber.  But I venture to suggest that that is\nnot because we are bound to do so, even if the decision is that of the Grand\nChamber, or because the Supreme Court is a court subordinate to the Strasbourg court, but because, having taken the Strasbourg decision into account and\nexamined it, it will often follow that it is appropriate to do so.  But it will not\nalways be appropriate to do so.  What I respectfully suggest is that statute\nensures that the final word does not rest with Strasbourg, but with our Supreme Court.\n”\n&#xa0;\nIn the same speech, Lord Chief Justice Judge argued that “\nToo many decisions from Strasbourg, and too ma\nn\ny domestic decisions, are cited in argument, and, I’m sorry to have to say this to my brother and sister judges, in all our judgments\n.”\n&#xa0;\nLord Neuberger, currently President of the Supreme Court, said the following in 2011, shortly after Parliament had voted to retain the current ban on prisoner voting:\n“\nThe fact remains though that when Strasbourg speaks, it is ultimately for\nParliament to consider what action needs to be taken...Placing such decisions\nin the hands of the judicial branch of the state poses a danger for the judiciary\nand for liberal democracy, because it removes the debate from the public and\ntheir elected representatives.\n \n&#xa0;\nIt is the clear view of two of this country’s most respected and senior judges that decisions of the European Court of Human Rights\n \nare \nbinding neither on UK courts nor\n Parliament.  The Strasbourg court \nhas issued judgments on UK prisoners’ voting rights, but the question of \nwhether to enfranchise more prisoners or retain the current ban is one for Parliament. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;The right to vote is not a human ri\nght; it is a civic right.  Human rights\n are \nby definition \nextended \nunder the ECHR\n to every human being.  Fundamental rights like \nArticle 3 ECHR – “No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman\n or degrading treatment \nor punishment\n”\n \nare held under the Convention to apply \nwith reservation \nto every citizen regardless of \ngender, nationality, \nrace, religion, age\n, property, political opinion or any other status\n.\n&#xa0;\nVoting rights, on the other hand, are \nusually \nqualified.  As discussed in our response to Additional Question 1 (above) the term “universal suffrage” was specifically exclude\nd from the text of the E\nC\nHR\n in recognition of the fact that not every citizen is entitled to vote.\n  \n&#xa0;\nEvery \nsingle \nmember country of the Council of Eur\nope imposes some form of \nrestrictions\n on the right to vote\n, for instance by imposing a minimum voting age\n or limiting the right to vote to their own nationals.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;It is entirely appropriate to deprive prisoners of the right to vote for the duration of their \nsentence.  Indirectly, through their right to choose their elected representatives, voters have the power to make, influence, block and amend laws.  That important power to shape the laws of the land is one that should not be granted to those who, at the time of an election, are serving a custodial sentence for breaking one or more of those laws.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;The European Court of Human Rights is unable to \nenforce its own judgments or compensation awards\n against national governments\n.  \n \nFurthermore, the Council of Europe cannot impose fines on the UK Government for non-compliance with European Court of Human Rights judgments.  If Britain maintains the current ban on prisoners voting \nthen \nt\nhe unimplemented judgment \nin \nHirst v UK\n \nwill \nsimply remain, along with hundreds of others, \non the \nCouncil of Europe \nCommittee\n of Ministers’ list for review.\n This is the same body that, through the Izmir Declaration 2011 and the Brighton Declaration 2012, has called on Strasbourg\n to show greater respect for national democratic institutions.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;According to the European Court of Human Rights\n, as it held\n in the case of \nFrodl\n v Austria\n,\n it is unlawful for a government to impose a ban on prisoner voting based \nsolely \non the length of the sentence being served.  Therefore if the UK Government opted to amend the law in order to disqualify \nfrom voting prisoners sentenced\n to\n more than six months, four years or any other fixed period then it c\nould, based on existing Strasbourg case law, be interpreted as another form of “blanket” restrictio\nn and therefore ruled unlawful.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Domestically, retaining the current ban on prisoner voting would respect the clearly stated view of Parliament, as expressed \nmost recently \non 10 February 2011 when the House of Commons voted by 234 votes to 22 in favour of the following motion:\n&#xa0;\nThat this House notes the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights\nin Hirst v the United Kingdom in which it held that there had been no\nsubstantive debate by members of the legislature on the continued justification\nfor maintaining a general restriction on the right of prisoners to vote;\nacknowledges the treaty obligations of the UK; is of the opinion that legislative decisions of this nature should be a matter for democratically-elected lawmakers;\nand supports the current situation in which no sentenced prisoner is able to vote except those imprisoned for \ncontempt, default or on remand.\n&#xa0;\nIf the UK retained its current ban on prisoner voting, and therefore refused to implement the judgments against it in \nHirst\n and \nGreens and MT\n, the sanctions at the Council of Europe level would be primarily political\n.  There might\n be some \nmild diplomatic \ncriticism from the Council of Europe’s Committee of Ministers in Strasbourg.  However, expulsion \nfrom the Council of Europe \nis utterly implausible\n.\n \n The Council\n of Europe has not \nexpe\nlled\n Bulgaria for \nbreaches of the right to life (\ncases of fatal polic\ne brutality\n)\n, Moldova for \nthe \ntorture\n \nof\n prison\ners\n and Russia for a\ntrocities committed \nby its armed forces \nin Chechnya.  \nIf the Government refuses\n to change the law \non \nprisoner voting, the m\natter will remain on the \nlist of unenforced judgments kept by the Council of Europe.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;A\ns explained in our response to Question 5, the European Court of Human Rights held, in the case of \nFrodl v Austria\n, that it is unlawful for a government to impose a ban on prisoner voting based solely on the length of the sentence being served.  Therefore if the UK Government opted to amend the law in order to disqualify from voting prisoners sentenced to more than six months or \nmore than \nfour years, this could still be interpreted as another form of “blanket” restriction and therefore ruled unlawful.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Given the shifting goalposts of the European Court of Human Rights, any compromise solution is likely to be temporary.  The court has a political agenda that is likely to press gradually for the enfranchisement of all prisoners.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJune 2013\n1\n&#xa0;\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/192314/omsq-q4-oct-dec-2012__2_.pdf\n \nFrodl v Austria\n [2010] ECHR 508\n              \n \nHirst v the United Kingdom (No 2)\n [2005] ECHR 681\n \nArticle 3\n states\n&#xa0;\n: ‘The High Contracting Parties undertake to hold free elections at reasonable intervals by secret ballot, under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in\n the choice of the legislature.’\n Para 79.\n \nSection 2 of the Forfeiture Act 1870 provided that \nany person convicted of treason or a felony and sentenced to a term of imprisonment exceeding 12 months lost the right to vote at parliamentary or local elections until they had served their sentence.\n [1978] 2 EHRR 1 at para 31.\n \nHirst v the United Kingdom\n [2005] Judgment dated 6 October 2005, Joint Dissenting Opinion of Judges Wildhaber, Costa, Lorenzen, Kovler and Jebens, para 7.  Document can be found \nhere\n.\n \nHirst v the United Kingdom\n [2005] Judgment dated 6 October 2005, Dissenting Judgment of Judge Costa, para 9.  Document can be found \nhere\n.\n The Rt Hon The Lord Judge, \nThe Judicial Studies Board Lecture 2010\n, 17 March 2010.\n Lord Neuberger, \nWho Are The Masters Now?\n, Second Lord Alexander of Weedon Lecture, 6 April 2011.\n"
