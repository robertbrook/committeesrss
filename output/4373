default&#xa0;defaultAbout Keoghsdefault&#xa0;
defaultKeoghs is the only “top 
default100
default” law firm to focus exclusively on the handling and defence of both mainstream and specialist insurance claims.
default&#xa0;
default We offer an “end to end” claims service
default to insurers, public sector bodies and self-insured corporate
defaults
default which includes pre-litigation, litigation and costs negotiation activities.
default&#xa0;
default We represent insurers who, between them, provide around 70% of the motor insurance purchased in the 
defaultUK
default.
default&#xa0;
default With almost
default 1,200 dedicated staff Keoghs is a recognised leader in the field.
default&#xa0;
default In the last 12 months we have been instructed to handle in excess of 35,000 separate matters in total across all classes of personal injury claim.
default&#xa0;
defaultKeoghs has been closely engaged in the b
defaultroader Government reforms to the civil litigation system as enacted in Part 2 of the LASPO Act 2012 and other ancillary CPR changes as recommended by Lord Justice Jackson.

defaultIntroduction.default&#xa0;defaultWe welcomed the Committee’s Fourth Report on “Cost of Motor Insura
defaultnce: Whiplash” released on 
default31
defaultst
default July 2013
default. Whilst there were some points upon which we disagreed, we saw the overall response as both balanced and pragmatic. We have also seen Mrs 
defaultEllman’s
default letter of 29
defaultth
default October to the Secretary of State for Justice. We concur that whilst the Government’s own response to the whiplash issue should be broadly welcomed, that response was light on detail and timeframes. Certain key points raised were simply not mentioned and 
defaultas always, our concern is that “the devil will be in the detail”.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe will deal with what we consider to be the key outstanding points in turn:

default&#xa0;
defaultWe welcome the 
defaultTSC
default’s continued engagement and scrutiny in this important policy area.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have articulated our concerns and would welcome the chance to discuss these further with members of the 
defaultTSC
default. We would also express an over-arching concern in terms of timeframes. We are all of course aware that an Election will take place in May 2015. R
defaultealistically therefore, much of this important work will have to be undertaken and delivered against in the next 12 months. The 
defaultMoJ
default have stated tha
defaultt they intend to work “at pace”
default - a comment which we welcome.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is now for all stakeholders to support the 
defaultMoJ
default in their work and to help both the Committee and Government to implement meaningful change which will ultimately benefit the end consumer in the form of reduced motor premiums.
