defaultSafermedia
default will respond only to 
defaultcertain aspects of this Inquiry 
defaultwhich we set out below:
default•default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default What should the BBC be for and what should be the purpose of public service broadcasting?defaultThe raison 
defaultd’etre
default of the BBC 
defaultshould be to provide the licence fee paying British public
default with 
defaulta  first
default-
defaultclass service which is based on integrity and imp
defaultartiality and produces high quality output for all including news, current affairs
default, education
default and  entertainment.
default•default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default How well hadefaults the BBC performed in the current Charter period in achieving its mission and public purposes?defaultIn some cases very well but in others it has been lacking
default.
default•default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default What scope, scale and remit should the BBC have?defaultThe BBC has a worldwide reputation for the 
defaultquality of its journalism from highly respected BBC reporters around the world
default and the BBC can be proud of this record. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHowev
defaulter, 
defaultas about 70% of the news
default that
default people ‘consume’ in this country is via the BBC, we believe that there should be a better balan
defaultce in staff recru
defaultiting.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe BBC should always maintain the highest standards of neutrality, both factually and in its commentary.   There have been some notable deficits:  Panorama has been exposed for fabricating or skewing stories as in the programme 
defaultabout Primark and child labour in 
defaultBangalore
default; 
defaultand
default in 
defaultthe coverage of 
defaultAndrew 
defaultTyrie
default MP at the Conservative Party Conference.
defaultIn an earlier study, a BBC journalist David Kerr set o
defaultut to discover if the BBC is a 
defaultneutral a
defaultrbiter.  This study appears in 
defaultRobin 
defaultAit
defaultken's
default book, Can We Trust the BBC?
default&#xa0;
default In a chapter entitled The Moral Maze, Kerr considers 'the population control debate'.  “The BBC generally avoids entering into partnerships with campaigning groups but Kerr uncovers a complex web of relationships between 
defaultthe BBC, IPPF and a charity called Television Trust for the Environment (TVE). TVE is a prolific producer of programmes about the environment, development, human rights and health issues which it sells worldwide
default.
default“TVE's relationship with Panorama was both 
defaultpersonal - the reporter on 'Sex and the Holy City', Steve Bradshaw, is the husband of TVE's deputy director Jenny Richards - and formal - TVE co-hosted a pre-broadcast screening of 'Sex and the Holy City' followed by a debate chaired by the BBC's Francine 
defaultStock”.   
default“Kerr says the BBC also has a close relationship with IPPF through a project called 
defaultSexwise
default.
default&#xa0;
default This consists of sex education programmes
default&#xa0;
default broadcast worldwide
default&#xa0;
default and covering such 'topics as foreplay and intimacy, masturbation, homosexuality, unsafe
default abortion, sexual coercion, prostitution alongside subjects such as HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections and contraceptive methods for both men and women.'
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default In all t
defaulthe programmes and accompanying
default&#xa0;
defaultwebsite information and literature there are no re
defaultferences to social conservative teaching
default.
default“So when the BBC proclaims: 'We are independent, ho
defaultnest and impartial' Kerr wondered how that could
default be squared with the Corporation's close partnership with a pro-abortion organisation like IPPF.
default“
default £
default15m in taxpayer cash is spent by the  Corporation's charity on ‘international aid’ projects (''changing lives through media and communication') including ‘educating’ 
defaultAfrica
default on climate change and a ‘romantic’ soap for Indian radio.
default&#xa0;
default The charity is called 
defaultthe BBC World Service Trust .......It also produces foreign sex edu
defaultcation programmes, including an
default advertisement star
defaultr
defaulting an Asian beauty queen emerging from a bath seductively 
defaultencouraging men to use a condom.
default&#xa0;
default It has also produced a Hindi drama on relatio
defaultnships - 156 in the series.  The BBC’s charity gets £800,000 from the BBC, also funding from the Foreign office, the British Council, the EU and the UN, as well as cash from the charitable fo
defaultundation of Bill Gates.”

defaultMost r

default th
defaulte
default BBC charity has been in the s
defaultpotlight over impartiality

defaultBrussels
default last year.
defaultSafermedia
default 
defaultwonders how 
defaultmany licence
default 
defaultfee payers are aware o
defaultf this charity and its activities.
default&#xa0;
defaultAnother recent example of bias, in our view, has been shown 
defaultin the BBC’s attitude towards pornography.    In Radio 4 Analysis ‘Pornography: What do we know?’ on 30 June 2013 and 
defaultNewsnight’s
default ‘Online porn boom: liberating 
defaultminds or damaging brains’ on 14
defaultth
default August 2013
default, the 
defaultBBC  did
default not provide balance or show any interest in the precautionary pr
defaultinciple where harm is concerned;   
defaultthis shows
default that
default the BBC 
defaultis 
defaultout of step with the majority of society which is extraordinary 
defaultgiven 
defaultthe concern not just in this country but globally 
defaultabout pornography especially its e
defaultffects on children.
default.
defaultThe licence fee should stay in order to keep the BBC as a public service broadcaster
default serving the licence fee payer
default.
default   There is a case for a reduction in the fee which could be achieved by scaling down the number of channels on offer for example.   Please see our views on Channel Three below.
defaultW
defaulte think that
default the licence fee should remain with the BBC
default and not be given to commercial broadcasters.
default&#xa0;default-  Lord Hall recently spoke
default of his vision for the BBC’s future, which “
defaultbelongs
default” to viewers.
default“Digital technology now means that we are able to hand to our listeners and viewers a huge amount of control that 30 years ago we kept to ourselves,” he said.
default“No listener or viewer should ev
defaulter have to feel a sense of powerless frustration that the BBC they want has succumbed to a BBC they didn’t ask for, because in future individuals will have the ability to control the BBC themselves
default.”
defaultThis
default is a rather lofty 
defaultstatement and we wonder what it m
defaulteans in practice.    Digital technology is only accessible for those who are online.    This leaves the 15% or so of people not online disenfranchised, particularly the elderly and the disadvantaged.   
default 
default-
defaultGiven the recent scandals at the BBC, including 
defaultSav
defaultile
default (please see note at the end of this section
default*
default)
default, remuneration, bias and the unseemly blame game between the Trust Chairman and the previous Director General Mark T
defaulthompson, we believe there needs to
default be a real change in the culture
default,
default and proper accountabili
defaultty to the licence fee payer
default, not just lip service
default.  
default                                                                                      
default-
default 
defaultThis accountability can work more fairly if the Trust 
defaultbecomes entirely independent of, and separate from, the BBC Executive.   It cannot represent 
defaultboth at the same time.
default- Editorial Guidelines should be re-drafted
default and simplified 
defaultunder close scrutiny by the
default Trust.
default-
default 
defaultIn the interests of transparency and 
defaultopenness we also suggest that the Trust should include
default 
defaultone member who represents the licence fee payer
default 
defaultdirectly, for example a representative from an independent
default media
default charity such as 
defaultSafermedia
default.   
default- 
defaultA member of the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committ
defaultee might also be 
defaultincluded
default on a rotating basis to ensure political 
defaultbalance.
default*
defaultIt is interesting
default to note that on the subject of
default the 
defaultSavile
default scandal, in June 2002 the BBC broadcast, ‘Hunt for 
defaultBritain
default’s Paedophiles’ on BBC Two.   This programme generated large n
defaultumbers of complaints for its graphic content.  The video footage, photos, ‘sex’ drawings, taped telephone conversations
default of paedophiles with children, and verbal descriptions (including bad language) were so explicit they might have helped to: develop an in
defaultterest in paedophilia in some vulnerable adults and desensitise others;  give existing paedophiles guidance on how to target and groom children; traumatise some child viewers, or lead them to develop a precocious sexual interest and lastly create the sort 
defaultof hysteria which can lead to dangerous vigilantism. 
defaultodefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default In a constantly evolving communications environment, does a 10-year Royal Charter and Agreement with the Secretary of State, together, provide the most appropriate constitutional framework for defaultthe BBC?defaultWe believe it does and should continue to do so.   However, there needs to be a 
defaultvery 
defaultdifferent style of management and accountability if this is to work
default for the public good
default.
default 
default  
defaultA little more humility and less arrogance.
defaultThe BBC’s Royal Charter statdefaultes that “The BBC exists to serve the public interest” and that its main object is the promotion of the following Public Purposes:defaultThe public purposes are extremely worthy but t
defaulthe BBC does not live up to them.   
defaultE
defaultxample
defaults of three
default on which we base most of ou
defaultr comments are
default: sustaining citizenship and civil society
default;
default stimulating cre
defaultativity and cultural excellence and promoting education and learning
default.
defaultOver several years, the BBC has consistently driven down standards in some of its content and we believe this has contributed towards a coarsening of society, especially harmful to the development of good values for children and young people.   We have 
defaultbro
defaultught this to the attention of the BBC 
defaultmany times as have 
defaultou
defaultr supporters 
defaultalso.   Please see 
defaultour  
defaultproforma
default letters of 2002 and 2007 which, while eliciting so
defaultme interest from the Trust
default initially
default, 
default did not convert into any action to reduce the decline in stand
defaultards.
default    Inde
defaulted
default this decline continues apace; 
defaultincreasingly
default,
default TV and radio programmes, in particular dramas, feature unacceptable levels of violent, sexual and sexually violent material and bad language. 
defaultWe continue to experience biased reporting of news an
defaultd current affairs, indeed reports of BBC bias are far too frequent
default, and not without foundation.
defaultShould the BBC’s output and services be provided to any greater or lesser degree for particular audiences?defaultLord Hall said, “Now we deliver so much more with fou
defaultr times more television channels, twice as many national radio stations, impressive web services and the 
defaultiPlayer
default.”
default 
default&#xa0;
default1.  
defaultT
defaulthe number of television
default channels
default. The BBC should have fewer television channels and would do well to focus on the audience as a whole,
default and treat everyone with equal respect and provide equal quality.   The current situation regarding television breaks the population down into groupings: the populist BBC One; the more serious BBC Two and BBC Four (BBC Four was be
defaultst rated channel in 2011)
default,
default  and
default 
defaultBBC Three for younger audiences (we are not going to discuss children’s programming here).
default    By targeting different groups this ghettoises viewing and does little to raise aspiration or promote family viewing and link g
defaultenerations.   
default&#xa0;

default.    This 
defaultchannel
default 
default 
default“
defaulttargets young audience as a …...place to nurture 
default‘
defaulttalent
default’
default for BBC One
default”
default.   
default  
defaultBBC Thre
defaulte 
defaultshares programmes with BBC One,
default apparently 
defaultto provide additional chances to watch programmes which appeal to younger audience (surely BBC 
defaultiPlayer
default does this,  
defaultso why repeat 
defaultEastEnders
default for example, on another channel)
default.
default This adds to unnecessary duplication.
default&#xa0;
default(We note the projected service licence content spend 2016/17 for  BBC Three was £85.5m and that it will see a percentage reduction of 10%.  This 
defaultspend is still significantly higher than say BBC Four which manages to make good quality, informative programmes.)
default&#xa0;
defaultThe question that must be asked is why does the BBC target young people with such down market 
defaultdross and 
defaultoft-repeated material?  
defaultT
defaulthere is the
default occasional good
default documentary but why are these not given a wider audience
default.  
default The BBC Three Controller tells us
default the young people like the content
default but is that good enough?   After all, the current younger generation has been raised on a diet of declining con
defaulttent standards and coarsening programming and this is what they know
default, 
default expect
default, and enjoy
default.  Much o
defaultf Channel Three output is 
defaulthighly 
defaultcrass and crude
default 
default‘
defaultcomedy
default’
default (try Russell Howard’s Good News or Family Guy). 
default   This does not 
defaultoffer valuable and enriching content
default to
default 
defaultraise the aspirations of young people or teach them about history or the arts, or 
defaultserve the 
defaultpublic  interest
default  but
default,
default rather, 
default 
defaultthe opposite.
default   
default&#xa0;
defaultBBC Three 
defaultcaters for 
defaultages 16-34 
defaultbut 
defaultwill without doubt attract a good many under 16 year olds 
defaultwho will enjoy t
defaulthe animations.   
defaultMany
default of the programmes have a warning at the beginning such as ‘Contains strong lan
defaultguage’ and ‘
defaultContains
default 
defaultsome strong language and adult humour’
default.  To access the programmes you simply have to click on a button.   There are no checks to verify
default age and, although the BBC does operate a parental control system, this does not seem enough given the propensity of many parents to neglect these controls as 
defaultOfcom’s
default ‘Children and Parents: Media Use and Attitudes Report, October 2013’ clearly shows.
default  It i
defaults simply not good enough to put the burden of responsibility on parents alone who are generally unaware of th
defaulte content of the programmes or w
defaulthat their children are watching.   This is exacerbated by the variety of devices used to watch television now 
defaultonlin
defaulte 
defaultespecially with the rise in children using 
defaultsmartphones
default.
default   Given the findings of the 
defaultOfcom
default Report, the BBC shows an extraordinary disregard for children and young people.
default&#xa0;
default4
default.  
defaultA reduction in episodes of
default 
defaultEastEnders
default could be undertaken especially as an incr
defaultease in 
defaultthe  number
default has resulted in poorer quality and a growing trend towards sensationalism, violence and sexual content as a ploy to keep viewers watching.  Any justification for controversial storylines on the grounds 
defaultof  raising
default difficult issues is di
defaultsingenuous, and in some instances has contributed to high levels of complaints.   The bottom line seems to be ratings once again and keeping viewers in front of the television for the rest of the evening.    
default5
default.   The 
defaultBBC 
default has
default been host to nudity, violence
default and explicit drug taking in the risqué thriller ‘Hidden’
default for example
default.   From The Romans to Henry Tudor, 
defaultLady Chatterley’s Lover to Men Only, 
defaultthe BBC seems intent on reducing its drama, historical or otherwise, to the lowest common denominator.  
defaultThe contro
defaultversial Jerry Springer the Opera 
defaultdrove a horse and cart through our blasphemy laws in the face of huge public outcry.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultMost 
defaultrecently 
default new
default dramas such as Escape Artist  and  
defaultRipper Street
default glorify in
default graphic
default violence
default,
default sexual violence
default and gore
default.  
default  While scheduled p
defaultost 
defaultthe 
defaultwatershed
default such 
defaultcontent is a problem 
defaultfor the
default many older viewers
default who
default do 
defaultnot  enjoy
default ‘gritty/edgy’ drama and are upset by being confronted with bad language, violence, sex  etc.   ‘Context’ does not dispel the effect of the image or 
defaultword, even for the most discerning viewers.    It should also be remembered that scheduling does not prevent younger viewers watching unsuitable content
default (as commented on under BBC Three).
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultOn Radio 4 G F Newman’s ‘The Corruption’ attracted a large level o
defaultf complaints.
default 
defaultOther daytime programmes have also drawn complaint
defaults
default about their sexual references such 
defaultThe Archers, t
defaulthe Diary of Samuel Pepys and a
default Woman’s Hour drama.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the portentous words of 
defaultAldous
default Huxley on Pleasures (1923): “
defaultWith a mind almost atrop
defaulthied by lack of use, unable to entertain itself and grown so wearily uninterested in the ready-made distractions offered from without that nothing but the grossest stimulants of an ever-increasing violence and crudity can move it, the democracy of the futu
defaultre will sicken of a chronic and mortal boredom.”
default6. 
default  
defaultEditorial Standards
default&#xa0;default defaultEverything hinges on the
default default‘defaultEditorial Guidelinesdefault’default giving details of how the language used in the Guidelines can be interpreted
default 
defaultand how little understanding the ordinary licence fee 
defaultpayer 
defaulthas of the Guidelines which require a great deal of effort
default, both in time and intellectual ability,
default to refer to.
default&#xa0;defaultThe BBC 
defaultsay they 
defaultset out to apologise quickly
default when appropriate and respond
default to the issues 
defaultraised
default.
default   
defaultHowever, 
defaultapologetic responses very oft
defaulten leave the complainant frustrated and confused when the complaint is not upheld.
defaultFor example, letters in response to a complaint say things like “We would never deliberately set out to cause offence”*; “It is inevitable that programmes which are 
defaultacceptable to some will occasionally strike others as distasteful and the only realistic and fair approach for us is to ensure that the range of our output is broad enough for everyone to feel that they are catered for at least some of the time”**; “We fee
defaultl that our adult audience members should make up their own minds about what they personally find acceptable and we therefore try to ensure that enough detail is given about programmes for an informed decision to be made.”; “programmes containing strong lan
defaultguage are usually signposted by presentation announcements so that no-one will be taken by surprise.”**
default* ;
default “There is no single set of standards in this area (
defaultbad language on this occasion) 
defaulton which the whole of society can agree.  The BBC has issued detail
defaulted guidelines to programme makers in order to try and minimise the risk of gratuitous offence.”****    (these BBC response comments come in one email dated 18 July 2011 Ref: CAS-869429-1H894G)
default&#xa0;
default* 
defaultequally
default, this suggests that the BBC is sanguine if it has ca
defaultused offence.
default**this begs the question, where is the line on ‘broad range of output’ drawn and what percentage of the time should a licence fee payer expect to find something which doesn’t offend?  And why is it ‘fair’ to cater for the taste of the lowest 
defaultcommon denominator?
default*** this does not allow for channel hopping and accidentally coming across offensive material, even in programmes which sound innocuous enough.   This is a common complaint from our supporters.  
default**** Surely there should be certain (eth
defaultical) standards for the BBC to abide by. The BBC’s “duty to use resources efficiently and proportionately in the interests of the licence fee payers as a whole” would be easier to achieve if the Editorial Guidelines were clear and specific, thus saving a g
defaultreat deal of everyone’s time and energy and contributing to higher standards.    At present they are weighted in favour of editorial flexibility by being couched in permissive language.  This means that the complainant generally will receive a typical BBC 
defaultbrush
default off.
default 
defaultIt must be the responsibility of the Editor in Chief, the Director General, to ensure the Guidelines cannot be interpreted too widely by program
defaultme makers and editorial staff, also, and of equal importance, to ensure that the Guidelines are easi
defaultly understood by the viewer and listener.
default    For too long the Guidelines h
defaultave helped the BBC make a speciality
default of
default self-jus
defaulttification which takes 
defaulttime and great determination to tackle
default through the lengthy 
defaultcomplaints procedure.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is hardly surprising then,
default that at a meeting with Fran O’Brien at the Trust three or four years ago  she told us they had only received one appeal on the subject of sexual content.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultFor a previous consultation, 
defaultDirector General, Mark Thompson,
default 
defaultsaid
default:  default“Your views help shape the 
defaultdecisions we take about the BBC’s services and the priorities we set the BBC’s management.”
default    defaultThese words appear to
default have been
default empty rhetoric most of the time.    
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Guidelines are still lacking in clarity, ambiguous, open to interpretation and permissi
defaultve, as before, serving producers’ interests rather than the interests of the licence fee payer, and causing confusion among employees as to what is and is not allowed.  What is the resulta
defaultnt 
defaultcost of editorial and legal 
defaultadvice to programme makers?  If guide
defaultlines were more specific and clear cut, there would be less need to resort to such advice – so is this costing the licence fee payer more money as some producers 
defaultpush boundaries
default and editors make mistakes
default?
