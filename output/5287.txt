[[[Detention of Filimone Lacanivalu]]]&#xa0;Thank you for your letter dated 15 November expressing your concerns about the treatment of Mr Lacanivalu.&#xa0;I recognise and value the immense sacrifice and contribution made by members of our Armed Forces, including foreign and Commonwealth personnel. Their contribution is reflected in the Immigration Rules and nationality legislation, which enable foreign and Commonwealth personnel to apply to naturalise as a British citizen after five years' service, or alternatively to apply for settlement after four years' service.&#xa0;Foreign and Commonwealth military personnel are exempt from immigration control while serving. On discharge, they are given a period of grace of 28 days to regularise their immigration status and can subsequently apply to settle here up to two years after leaving the military, although they are expected not to have remained here in breach of immigration laws in that time. Mr Lacanivalu did not apply to regularise his stay in the UK for over two years.&#xa0;Whilst immigration officials correctly applied the rules in this case, it is not clear that Mr Lacanivalu's Army unit correctly explained to him the immigration procedures on his discharge. In the light of the particular circumstances of this case, I have personally intervened. Mr Lacanivalu was released from detention on Friday 15 November and will shortly be granted Indefinite Leave to Remain in the UK exceptionally outside the Immigration Rules. &#xa0;I instructed UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) to complete an urgent review of all of the cases of those individuals identified as ex-HM Armed Forces who are currently detained. The review identified a total of eight former British Armed Forces personnel in detention. The majority of these (six) are pending deportation following serious criminal offences and after obtaining a significant custodial sentence. One further individual has been detained following curtailment of exemption from immigration control due to drug abuse. The individual in the remaining case was discharged from the Armed Forces in 2010 following a failed drugs test. All individuals have been assessed and in each case continued detention is considered to be both justified and proportionate.&#xa0;You also asked for details of British Army veterans who have been granted British citizenship as well as the number deported in the years since 2008; this information is not available.&#xa0;The Rt Hon Theresa May MPHome Secretary&#xa0;
