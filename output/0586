Written evidence submitted by the National Oceanography Centre (ESA010)[bold]Declaration of interests[bold]The National Oceanography Centre (NOC)
[normal] 
[normal]is a research centre wholly owned by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).
[normal] 
[normal]NOC
[normal] 
[normal]undertakes
[normal] 
[normal]integrated ocean research and technology development from the
[normal] coast to the deep ocean. 
[normal]The 
[normal]Satellite Oceanography group at NOC (NOC-SO) delivers 
[normal]fundamental global earth observation ocean 
[normal]research, 
[normal]and 
[normal]consultancy and training in ocean remote sensing techniques to monitor the ocean, shelf seas and coastal regions
[normal]. 
[normal]NOC-SO is actively engaged with the European Space Agency, wh
[normal]ich
[normal] 
[normal]is a major funder of the
[normal] NOC-SO activities in the form of contracts. 
[normal]NOC-SO has developed 
[normal]close relationships with key stakeholders in the space sector
[normal], particularly in the UK 
[normal]with companies such as SSTL and 
[normal]Astrium
[normal]. NOC’s 
[normal]position
[normal] 
[normal]within
[normal] academic research and 
[normal]its 
[normal]long-term strategic outlook allows 
[normal]it
[normal] to define and develop new satellite missions, sensors and Earth Observation products that address the needs of 
[normal]operational 
[normal]users, enhance the international competitive advantage of the UK space industry and are of benefit to science
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1 
[normal]ESA 
[normal]is
[normal] a major funder of research and development (R&amp;D) in Earth Observation
[normal], mainly
[normal] 
[normal]through
[normal] contracts awarded 
[normal]after
[normal] open competitive tendering
[normal] 
[normal]across
[normal] its member states
[normal]. ESA’s tendered work is clearly 
[normal]tied
[normal] 
[normal]to
[normal] the overall scientific objectives outlined in ESA’s well publicized and regularly updated strategy, which accounts for latest technical advances and awareness of 
[normal]the 
[normal]evolving needs of its users. 
[normal]Contracts are 
[normal]close
[normal]ly supervised
[normal] by 
[normal]highly qualified 
[normal]technical officers 
[normal]from ESA 
[normal]and 
[normal]characteri
[normal]s
[normal]ed by a 
[normal]clear 
[normal]set of 
[normal]deliverables
[normal] to be produced 
[normal]within a 
[normal]usually 
[normal]tight schedule
[normal]. 
[normal]1.2 
[normal]Despite tough demands and relatively small budgets (typically &lt; 500KEuros), ESA R&amp;D contracts
[normal] 
[normal]are 
[normal]prestigious and 
[normal]sought-after, as they 
[normal]produce
[normal] 
[normal]well-focused 
[normal]cutting edge research 
[normal]on
[normal] 
[normal]t
[normal]echnically challenging topics and p
[normal]romote the development of
[normal] new capability, 
[normal]which 
[normal]itself 
[normal]often 
[normal]lead
[normal]s
[normal] to further funding opportunities.
[normal] 
[normal]1.3 
[normal]ESA is 
[normal]also 
[normal]one of very few
[normal] funding 
[normal]bodies
[normal] that will support all partners, academic and industrial
[normal] alike
[normal], at 10
[normal]0% 
[normal]funding 
[normal]level. This promotes
[normal] 
[normal]real
[normal] working 
[normal]partnerships
[normal] and the development of long-term relationships between academia and industry. 
[normal]It
[normal] also 
[normal]provides the means 
[normal]to collaborate with partners in other European coun
[normal]tries by way of small project teams, 
[normal]without the heavy administrative burden imposed by current EU funding schemes
[normal] (e.g. FP7)
[normal].
[normal]2.1 
[normal]NOC is not in a position to comment on the most effective governance between ESA, EU and UK. 
[normal]2.2 
[normal]However, t
[normal]he “rapprochement” of ESA towards the EU 
[normal]that is proposed by the European Commission 
[normal]does not
[normal] 
[normal]seem 
[normal]desirable
[normal], since it will 
[normal]undoubtedly 
[normal]disrupt
[normal] ESA’s ability to deliver 
[normal]as a “
[normal]world-class 
[normal]organization 
[normal]that deserves credit for European successes in the space field over the last decades
[normal]”, 
[normal]a fact that is
[normal] recognised by the Commission itself. 
[normal]2.3 
[normal]While
[normal] investments in ESA have led to major successes and the development of 
[normal]a 
[normal]strong, internationally competitive 
[normal]European 
[normal]space 
[normal]sector
[normal], the scientific 
[normal]and economic 
[normal]return
[normal]s
[normal] on 
[normal]the 
[normal]large invest
[normal]ments made in EU science programs are arguably less clear. 
[normal]ESA's funding of space R&amp;D shows 
[normal]detailed understanding of the scientific drivers and industrial capability
[normal] in Europe, leading to well-
[normal]focussed projects. In contrast, the
[normal] EU funds mainly large projects, selected after grading by non-specialist anonymous peer-reviewers, 
[normal]where significant resources 
[normal]are
[normal] diverted 
[normal]away from research to deal with the EU’s bureaucratic demands and unwieldy management tools
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]2.4 
[normal]In addition, whereas there are 
[normal]clear 
[normal]established channels for the UK to 
[normal]make its voice heard
[normal] within ESA, 
[normal]the ways to influence the EU are 
[normal]more opaque 
[normal]and drawn-out and may result in a loss of influence in decisions relevant to the interests of the UK space sector.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1 
[normal]NOC is not in a position to comment on the impact of changes to the Multi-Annual Financial Framework on ESA and 
[normal]support from 
[normal]Horizon 2020.
[normal]3.2 
[normal]Projects funded 
[normal]so far under
[normal] the C
[normal]ommission's FP7 Space calls do not generally support new R&amp;D in the space sector but tend to exploit opportunities arising from previous investments by ESA. EU funded space projects are 
[normal]mainly concerned with 
[normal]facilitating
[normal] access to 
[normal]established 
[normal]Earth Observation (EO) 
[normal]data
[normal] products, or with the exploitation of existing EO products for 
[normal]societal 
[normal]and economic 
[normal]benefits
[normal]. 
[normal]3.3 There is no or little EU investment in designing/building new space instrumentation, developing new algorithms and products, or in validation and quality control of EO products. 
[normal]The latter are 
[normal]areas of research that 
[normal]score badly in 
[normal]competitive science 
[normal]assessment system
[normal]s
[normal] (including 
[normal]those in
[normal] the UK) and are 
[normal]thus 
[normal]predominantly funded by 
[normal]ESA
[normal]. 
[normal]Yet, these 
[normal]activities 
[normal]are
[normal] essential 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]bridge
[normal] the gap between two en
[normal]d points - development of satellite missions and sensors on the one hand, 
[normal]and the downstream 
[normal]exploitation
[normal] of established EO products 
[normal]for
[normal] environmental 
[normal]science, operational monitoring and commercial services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1 
[normal]NOC we
[normal]lcomed
[normal] the increased 
[normal]UK contribution to 
[normal]the 
[normal]ESA budget at the last ministerial meeting in 2012. This visible commitment by the UK to space 
[normal]sent a strong message across Europe and 
[normal]immediately opened 
[normal]up 
[normal]new opportunities for the UK to benefit from its investments in ESA. 
[normal]4.2 
[normal]NOC also welcom
[normal]ed
[normal] the establishment of the UK Space Agency 
[normal](UKSA) 
[normal]as the means 
[normal]of providing
[normal] national focus and coordination of space activities.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]here 
[normal]is
[normal], however, 
[normal]much room for improvement
[normal], in particular 
[normal]regarding
[normal] UKSA
[normal]’s
[normal] detachment and inaccessibility from the UK space community. 
[normal]While w
[normal]e recognize that UKSA is currentl
[normal]y undergoing management changes, 
[normal]we can only hope that these 
[normal]changes 
[normal]will address the shortcomings of its operations so far. The main issues with UKSA are as follows: 
[normal]4.2.1
[normal] 
[normal]Insufficient
[normal] scientific or technical 
[normal]awareness 
[normal]by UKSA 
[normal]representatives 
[normal]attending important official meetings (e.g. 
[normal]ESA 
[normal]PBEO
[normal] and 
[normal]GMES
[normal] ). 
[normal]This contrasts with other European countries whose representatives have 
[normal]enough
[normal] scientific understanding to 
[normal]grasp
[normal] the nature and relevance of issues being discussed.
[normal] 
[normal]4.2.2
[normal] 
[normal]P
[normal]oor communication with the UK space community of UK 
[normal]strategic 
[normal]interests
[normal] and priorities
[normal]. For example, little
[normal] i
[normal]s
[normal] known
[normal] 
[normal]about
[normal] the motivation 
[normal]for
[normal] 
[normal]the UK
[normal]’s
[normal] increased contribution to ESA
[normal], or about which ESA programs 
[normal]are seen as 
[normal]UK high or low priorities.
[normal]4.2.3
[normal] 
[normal]N
[normal]o transparency about 
[normal]the 
[normal]interactions between UKSA and 
[normal]other 
[normal]UK 
[normal]agencies with interests in space and Earth Observation, 
[normal]e.g.
[normal] NERC, N
[normal]ational 
[normal]C
[normal]entre for 
[normal]E
[normal]arth 
[normal]O
[normal]bservation
[normal], 
[normal]Centre for Earth Observation Instrumentation, 
[normal]DEFRA, Met 
[normal]Office, etc
[normal]. These interactions are the main routes 
[normal]to ensure integration of space activities within the UK. 
[normal]Yet there 
[normal]are no visible signs of their 
[normal]effectiv
[normal]eness, or even of their existence.
[normal] An important example relates to the UK position of the funding of Jason-CS to ensure continuity of high-precision time series of sea level measurements from satellite altimeters.
[normal]4.2.4
[normal] 
[normal]It
[normal] i
[normal]s important that 
[normal]the respective responsibilities of 
[normal]UKSA and NERC to 
[normal]support 
[normal]research
[normal] that bridges the gap between technology development
[normal],
[normal] science 
[normal]advance and 
[normal]exploitation
[normal] are clarified
[normal]. 
[normal]The UK
[normal] need
[normal]s
[normal] to avoid the situation where 
[normal]academics 
[normal]who engage with the private sector to develop and validate new 
[normal]missions, 
[normal]sensors a
[normal]nd products are
[normal] seen by NERC as
[normal] falling under
[normal] the remit of UKSA, and by UKSA as
[normal] 
[normal]falling 
[normal]under 
[normal]the remit of NERC. 
[normal]The
[normal] ambiguity about 
[normal]who funds 
[normal]such important
[normal] 
[normal]inter-disciplinary research is likely to originate from 
[normal]tight
[normal] 
[normal]budgetary 
[normal]conditions
[normal] both in 
[normal]NERC and UKSA.
[normal]4.2.5
[normal] With the exception of the 
[normal]small but 
[normal]very successful Centre for Earth Observation Instrumentation, there 
[normal]has been little opportunity 
[normal]in the UK in recent years 
[normal]for open competitive tendering 
[normal]for
[normal] research relating 
[normal]specifically 
[normal]to space and Eart
[normal]h Observation. The Harwell ISIC
[normal] and 
[normal]Space Catapult 
[normal]initiatives 
[normal]are likely to 
[normal]present such opportunities in future but it remains unclear 
[normal](after more than 2 years since they were set up) 
[normal]how academic and industrial 
[normal]players 
[normal]can best
[normal] engage with these, 
[normal]and what 
[normal]form these 
[normal]opportunities 
[normal]will take.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1 
[normal]The UK geo-return within ESA is now close to 1,
[normal] meaning that we receive most of our investments into ESA back in the form of contracts. This is
[normal] a substantial improvement from the situation just a few years ago. 
[normal]5.2 
[normal]With 
[normal]limited
[normal] UK funding for Earth Observation in recent years, ESA has provided a lifeline for many Earth Observation scientists in the UK
[normal] and contributed to the development of long-term partnerships between UK academia and industry
[normal]. Participation in ESA programs 
[normal]contributed to 
[normal]new scientific and industrial capability in the UK space sector, which now gives the UK a competitive edge in 
[normal]relation to
[normal] new opportunities within ESA (e.g. Earth Explorer 9) and elsewhere (e.g. 
[normal]S
[normal]STL’s
[normal] 
[normal]involvement in the 
[normal]NASA CYGNSS
[normal] and NSPO
[normal]/NOAA
[normal] FORMOSAT-7/COSMIC-2 missions
[normal]). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.1 
[normal]NOC is not in a position to comment on 
[normal]the resilience of the UK space-based infrastructure
[normal], or the threat to space debris or solar activity
[normal].
