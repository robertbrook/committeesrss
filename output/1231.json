"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Public Transport Action Group (TIC005)&#xa0;\nJust a couple of comments we have discovered when looking at a better public transport system within our Borough of Telford &amp; Wrekin \n&#xa0;\nwhich is bigger than County Town of Shrewsbury with approximately 103,000 plus 192,000 population in Rural Shropshire. Shropshire is a large County of 3,198 Sq Kilometres (1,235 Sq Miles) Telford is the largest Town of 290 Sq Kilometres \n( 112\n Sq Miles)\n&#xa0;\nTelford &amp; Wrekin Borough which is a New Town built in an old area and also covers 13 rural settlements\n&#xa0;\nhas a population of \n170,000.\n&#xa0;\nFirstly: Elderly people who mostly decide to stop in their original dwellings in the older area of the Borough become isolated because public transport cannot access their areas and all areas cannot be covered by our public transport system which wants to cover the younger population in our newer estate areas.\n&#xa0;\nSecondly: Rural areas cannot be covered because of the number of public not \nw\nanting to use public transport because of fare prices due to fuel and maintenance costs, then those areas become isolated. \n&#xa0;\nAll the above figures are approx but I hope they are in the right percentage.\n&#xa0;\nJuly 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
