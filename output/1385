defaultMaureen Comber – Written evidencedefault&#xa0;defaultI have been a Volunteer for The British Horse Society for over forty years specialising in Access and Rights of Way, so I am happy to pass on those parts of my experience which relate to the above, as evidence for your consideration.
default&#xa0;defaultThere is one omission in the draft Bill which could make a huge difference to horse riders throughout the country, and that is an amendment to CROWA 2000 Schedule 2 sec.2 (1
default)c
default.
defaultSection 2(1) - 
defaultdoes not entitle a person to be on any land if, in or on that land, he
default(c) 
defaulthas
default with him any animal other than a dog.
default  Please will you add the word ‘equine’ so that it reads dog or equine?  Horse riders feel disenfranchised from their use of the highways because of the speed, volume and size of vehicles, especially on the 
defaultTolkein
default like, narrow country lanes.  This small alteration, the inclusion of the word ‘equine’, would redress what appears to have been an oversight when Crow 2000 was enacted.  At the moment we hear of large grants awarded for cycling, while walkers gained ‘open 
defaultaccess’
default under CROW, so horse riders are feeling excluded if not discriminated against.  In addition we are losing our grass roots from a lack of safe riding routes.  It would therefore add considerable support to the equine industry which 
defaultis estimated to be worth £7 billion per annum to the UK economy and to employ 220,000 – 270,000 people [BHS]; as well as inclusion for horse riders.
default&#xa0;
defaultI agree with the proposals from GLEAM below.  It took me forty years to get Cradle Lane (BOAT) repaired by the LHA, during which time it was far from pleasant to use, until 2005 when it could no longer be used at all, because extensive damage caused by 4WD and motor cycles had made it unacceptably dangerous.  There then followed an excessive number of consecutive temporary TRO’s, illegally used by Hampshire County Council (HCC) over four years, preventing all use!  It is now repaired, but instead of the promised permanent TRO banning MPV’s to match the nine temporary ones, as per the expectations of the statute, RTA 1984 sec 14/15 (3),  HCC changed their minds at the last moment and decided they would permit motor bikes.  Since this is a section of the Shipwrights Way for non motorised users, the decision was unfathomable!  However those of us, who have had a long association with this Council, jokingly refer to it as being at The Castle, Westminster rather than Winchester, because they seem to be a law unto themselves!
default&#xa0;
defaultIn this respect I would ask you to consider whether they can be trusted to act impartially in the respect of rights of way claims?
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is because as mentioned above they have a lamentable inclination to do what they wish rather than what the law provides.  It has taken me thirty years to catch up with their maladministration with regards to 
defaultBroxhead
default Common, where it can be seen that they colluded with a landowner and illegally removed 80 acres of the common from the register for common land, for which they are the registration authority!!  This was done by false representation, failure to disclose, failure to transfer information to the documentation accurately and by completely ignoring the statutes etc. etc.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn these circumstances you will understand why I have not much faith in the integrity of local government in this respect?
default&#xa0;
defaultI strongly support the request of the Green Lanes Environmental Action Movement which is set out below.  My reason is that as I researched the history of Cradle Lane I discovered 
defaultthat once again Hampshire County Council had incorrectly upgraded it from its original status as a bridleway, to a Road Used as a Public Path (RUPP) and then in 1987 under WCA 1981 to a BOAT.
default&#xa0;
defaultThey had ignored the letter from the Head of Countryside, DOE, and upgraded the many RUPP’s in East Hampshire to BOAT en bloc, without researching to see if they qualified by having 20 years of vehicular use before 1930.  They wrongly assumed that if there was a wheel mark it must be a BOAT.  This has caused misery to very many people who would have liked to enjoy these ancient paths but could not, because of the severe damage inflicted by motorists, which eventually turned into to the sport of ‘
defaultmudplugging
default’, as it has come to be known.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is in total contrast to the importance the public give to the policy of protecting the countryside and sustainable transport etc.  Hopefully the suggestion by GLEAM, would put this matter right once and for all.  I would just make the point that this would not be excluding anyone, as all could enjoy a more peaceful environment without the damage, by leaving a vehicle in the nearest car park, while at the same time it would encourage 
defaultmore healthy
default, active, pollution free, lifestyles.
default-----------------
default&#xa0;
defaultGleam invite the Government to use the Deregulation Bill to close loopholes in rights of ways legislation beyond those already addressed in Clauses 12 - 18.  These defects remain following the enactment of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CROWA) and the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 (NERCA).   The loopholes now identified have resulted in extensive further damage to unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs) and unsealed unclassified county roads (UUCRs) by recreational off-road motor vehicles.

default&#xa0;
defaultI hope you will feel able to support these suggestions?  It will enable many more non-motorised users to enjoy an amenity that was actually meant for them, but was hi-jacked by a relatively small number of 
defaultmudpluggers
default.   It has taken decades to deal with the situation legislatively speaking, despite the 
defaultoverwhelming  public
default support for the protection of the countryside.  It is also entirely in line with all the sustainable transport and living policies in place to protect the environment, and the promotion of healthy active lifestyles.
