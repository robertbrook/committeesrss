[[[, January 2014.]]]&#xa0;Summary: Trade in primates as pets, wherever this trade occurs, is damaging to primate welfare and to conservation efforts.  The UK should take immediate steps to stop the trade and keeping of all primates.  &#xa0;Neotropical Primate Conservation (NPC), established in 2007, is an NGO that works to protect primates and their habitats in some of the most biologically diverse (and threatened) regions on the planet.  We are regularly involved in the confiscation, rescue and care of primates and other wildlife from illegal trade in South America, and are intimately familiar with the issues relevant to the keeping of primates as pets - especially the damage wreaked by the trade on the endangered primates of the region.&#xa0;In our submission  we comment only on the question of “whether people should be allowed to keep primates as pets”.  Other organisations are better placed to answer the other questions.    &#xa0;In short, the UK should act swiftly to ban the trade and keeping of pet primates in order to prevent the inevitable suffering that the pet trade causes for all primates and the negative impact that the trade has on wild populations. Support for a ban has been expressed by numerous professional veterinary, research, conservation, animal rights and welfare groups.(1–6)&#xa0;Few primate owners deliberately or knowingly harm their pets.  But by its very nature, the keeping of primates as pets is damaging and should not be allowed to continue.  In a review of the pertinent literature utilizing Schuppli and Frasier's “framework for assessing the suitability of different species as pets”,(7)  Soulsbury et.al. concluded: “strong evidence supports the argument that primates are not suitable pets; it is unlikely that the welfare of pet primates can be adequately addressed in normal households”.(8)  &#xa0;Research specifically pertaining to pet primates is scarce, but primates constitute the most extensively studied of all animal orders.(3)  Maternal deprivation and isolation from conspecifics, both of which are common practice in the primate pet trade, have been intensively studied since the 1950s and it is clear that these practices are detrimental to the welfare of primates as measured by parameters such as: neophobia; plasma cortisol levels; abnormal behaviours; anaclitic depression/withdrawal; cell-mediated immunity; and survivorship.(9–15)  Studies of captive primates in non-domestic environments, such as zoos and laboratories, demonstrate that even with specialist care, abnormal behaviours and captivity-related complications are hard to avoid.(16–19)   &#xa0;In a study of ex-laboratory chimpanzees at a North American sanctuary, chimps showed clear signs of what would be termed Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder [PTSD] in humans, according to the criteria set out in the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders).(20,21)  A similar study found that ex-pet capuchin monkeys resident at Wild Futures' Monkey Sanctuary in the UK showed symptoms of disorders homologous to PTSD, Major Depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder, at significantly higher rates than zoo capuchins.(22)  Pet monkeys are highly susceptible to metabolic bone disease, diabetes, obesity, emaciation, poor fur/skin condition, and other physical ailments.  &#xa0;With the great popularity of internet-based social networks and cable television channels in rural South America, people are increasingly exposed to European and North American cultural practices  and are strongly influenced by them.  When South Americans see that the keeping of pet primates is legally accepted in places like the UK, it encourages them to buy these species even in the face of their own country's prohibitions on trade.  Pet primates in South America are almost always wild caught, causing an estimated ten deaths for each monkey that survives to become a pet. The work of conservation NGOs and the authorities to tackle wildlife traffic is undermined and many endangered species are exposed to even greater risk of extinction.  &#xa0;To keep any animal as a pet should not be considered as an automatic right – it is a privilege that must hinge on whether a person is able to provide, and whether the animal itself is capable of experiencing, a good life as a pet.  Life as pets clearly and demonstrably damages primates.  There is no reason that the trade should be allowed to continue.    &#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;
