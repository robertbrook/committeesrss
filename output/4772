Written evidence from[bold] Claire Morgan[bold] (CYS 107)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I would like to submit the following comments as part of the cycling safety consultation.[bold] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. General information[bold] &amp; context[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I 
[normal]am a 
[normal]“utility cyclist” living in the rural village community of 
[normal]Ovingdean
[normal] 
[normal]on the eastern outskirts of Brighton in East Sussex. The village is bounded on all sides by main roads including the A259 trunk coastal road to the south.
[normal] 
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A
[normal]lthough I am a Brighton &amp;
[normal] Hove City Council officer, I am writing in a personal 
[normal]capacity f
[normal]rom the perspective of 
[normal]a resident of a city which is apparently the UK’s least car-dependent outside London. Yet, a
[normal]s someone who has placed concern and action for the environment at the core 
[normal]of my lifestyle since the early eighties, I have become increasingly concerned about (a) the relentless 
[normal]local 
[normal]march of a “car culture” and (b) the resulting, highly damaging in every respect, “them and us ‘war’ ” which has developed between regular drivers
[normal] and cyclists. 
[normal]1.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]W
[normal]e must do everything we can to encourage 
[normal]more 
[normal]people to cycle
[normal], more often – the 
[normal]reasons for, and benefits of, 
[normal]this are well documented.  As a society, we urgently need to pursue a variety of enhanced and new measures, targeted at ALL road 
[normal]users,
[normal] 
[normal]that
[normal] will support and enable safe and responsible cycling
[normal]. But with th
[normal]is encouragement must come a 
[normal]corresponding 
[normal]understanding 
[normal]that cyclists cannot 
[normal]use their relative superiority in terms of 
[normal]the 
[normal]speed and strength of their mode of transport
[normal] compared to pedestrians to intimidate and thus 
[normal]deter 
[normal]more vulnerable 
[normal]non-car-borne 
[normal]road/street users.
[normal] This is something I have been dismayed to observe increasingly
[normal] in the city of Brighton and 
[normal]Hove, and I can only ascribe it to the attitudes mentioned in 
[normal]1.2 above.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. Roads, [bold]highway [bold]layout[bold], road speeds [bold]and maintenance[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]Despite
[normal] the widespread existence of dedicated cycle lanes in 
[normal]more 
[normal]bike-friendly countries such as 
[normal]Holland, Belgium, 
[normal]Denmark
[normal] and Germany
[normal], I d
[normal]o NOT 
[normal]believe that 
[normal]simply b
[normal]lanketing this
[normal] 
[normal]country 
[normal]with 
[normal]segregated 
[normal]cy
[normal]cle lanes is 
[normal]the answer to 
[normal]improv
[normal]ing cycle safety. Indeed, the above-listed 
[normal]countries would 
[normal]not claim it is: their situations ar
[normal]e the result of an average of 25 years+ 
[normal]of positive, innovative cycle-promoting action. 
[normal] 
[normal]As always, 
[normal]as
[normal] intimated above, a 
[normal]range of long-term measures, linked to comprehensive education[bold] programmes for all road users,[bold] and in some cases [bold]improved and extended [bold]leg[bold]islation[bold], is the best solution.
[normal] C
[normal]orralling cyclists into special lanes militates against 
[normal]normalising cycling as a transport mode and nurtures too many motorists’ belief that cyclists should not be on “their” road when and if there is no alternative route, or a cyclist chooses not to use a provided path.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]Segregated
[normal] 
[normal]cycle lanes 
[normal]are 
[normal]in my v
[normal]iew 
[normal]more appropriate for “high-volume” urban areas, 
[normal]or 
[normal]for linking these areas along key arterial or “desire 
[normal]routes
[normal]” where there is significant potential for harm to cyclists.
[normal] However, 
[normal]cycle paths [bold]MUST be continuous, sensibly joined up[bold], or safety is again compromised as cyclists are 
[normal]repeatedly and/or unexpectedly 
[normal]“turfed out” onto the highway. 
[normal]Cycle lanes 
[normal]should also be 
[normal]maintained on the same maintenance/repair schedule as the highway, [bold]including cutting back vegetation[bold].
[normal] 
[normal]This can include
[normal] requiring private homeowners to prune back vegetation emanating from their premises. 
[normal]Outside urban areas, where there may nevertheless be roads carrying fast traffic (such as in my local area), where pavements exist these should wherever possible 
[normal]be re-de[bold]signated [bold]and signed [bold]as shared-use[bold]. This will improve cyclists’ (and 
[normal]drivers’ )
[normal] safety, as well as encouraging more cyclists.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3 
[normal]C[bold]olouring[bold] all cycle lanes, whether kerb-lined or not, in a different colour to give clarity to cyclists and other road users including pedestrians (
[normal]cf
[normal] blue cycle lanes in London).
[normal] This also raises awareness of cycling
[normal] &amp; cyclists
[normal] in general …
[normal]Page 2[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4. Re-designating an increased number of one-way smaller urban/city centre routes as able to be used as 
[normal]two-way for cyclists[bold]. It is my observation in Brighton and Hove that cyclists, like water, will always prefer the shortest and quickest route, and wil
[normal]l often be prepared to break the law on one-way streets to achieve this, thus compromising other road users’ and their own safety. A similar increase in the number of routes where all traffic except cyclists may turn right, left or go straight ahead would 
[normal]be helpful 
[normal]for the same reason.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal] 
[normal]Brighton &amp; Hove has introduced an extensive programme of 
[normal]20mph zones[bold], including many around schools
[normal]. While not necessarily popular with 
[normal]drivers, it has been widely welcomed by cyclists and other road users as supporting
[normal] road safety in general, not simply for cyclists. 
[normal]It should be noted that these zones are, in the main, not supported/’enforced’ by road humps, which could impede the comfortable passage of cyclists, buses and emergency vehicles.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6
[normal] 
[normal]Road repair and [bold]maintenance[bold] generally should be carried out in a manner which does not leave a 
[normal]“gutter gap”[bold] where asphalt ceases before the kerb or verge: this creates a hazard for cyclists (and moped/motorbike users) when and if they are pushed towards the side of the ro
[normal]ad by traffic, or out of nervousness. Such improved road surfacing would also benefit pedestrians.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.7
[normal] 
[normal]Police and traffic wardens[bold] must be encouraged to clamp down on parking across cycle lanes, and the few cases where parking across cycle lanes is permitt
[normal]ed should be abolished. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. Helmets[bold] and cycle equipment[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal] am NOT a supporter of compulsory bike helmet wearing, and in fact believe that legislating to make adult cycl
[normal]ists do so is counter-productive, as it militates against the ease and simplicity 
[normal]of just getting on a bike and riding away
[normal]. D
[normal]ata about the benefit
[normal]s
[normal] or otherwise to individual cyclists’ safety from wearing helmets is polarised – at least for adults.  There is evidence showing that drivers see helmet-wearing cyclists as less vulnerable, and 
[normal]they 
[normal]thus drive less carefully: there is also evidence indicat
[normal]ing that cyclists themselves cycle less carefully if they are wearing a helmet, for similar reasons. 
[normal]Further information, however, indicates that 
[normal]helmet wearing for children[bold] 
[normal]is
[normal] 
[normal]beneficial due to the different way in which children tend to fall from their b
[normal]ikes, compared to adults, 
[normal]ie
[normal] children tend to sustain more head injuries when they fall from a bike than adults, although of course collisions with motorised transport are identically dangerous for all age groups.
[normal] Improving road maintenance (see [2] above)
[normal] would help reduce the need anyway!
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]All new bikes sold should be required to have an 
[normal]enhance[bold]d level of reflective items [bold]on board
[normal] – something as simple as a range of stickers would be helpful.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.[bold]              [bold]Training[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]The nationwide children’s 
[normal]“[bold]cycle [bold]proficiency” scheme[bold] is not compulsory, but it should be made so, and centrally funded – to include secondary-aged children.
[normal]4.2
[normal]              
[normal]Some 
[normal]bus and PSV drivers already undergo cycle/cyclist awareness training[bold] – this should be made compulsory, with a requirement t
[normal]hat it is refreshed on a regular basis. Brighton &amp; Hove City Council runs a programme whereby cyclists are invited to sit in a bus driver’s cab, to identify the blind spots. I would like to see this programme extended for cyclists.
[normal]Page 3[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5[bold]. Public info[bold]rmation[bold] and awareness-raising[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The big success of making drinking and driving 
[normal]socially 
[normal]unacceptable came through public information campaigns
[normal] over a sustained period of time
[normal], as did other successful campaigns like smoking
[normal] cessation
[normal]. 
[normal]The scope for 
[normal]helping [bold]the safety of cycling through such public information campaigns[bold] is immense. 
[normal]Campaigns don’t need to be as graphic as some countries (
[normal]eg
[normal] Australia) have chosen to do, but a campaign could take forms such as the following:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6[bold]. [bold]Legislation[bold]&#xa0;[bold]6.1
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]Highway Code[bold] needs to be updated, so 
[normal]it is less focused on motorised vehicles, and more inclusive of the safety-enhancing needs of other road users including cyclists. This could include stating a 
[normal]minimum space between vehicles and bikes[bold], both while passing and before and after overtaking. 
[normal]6
[normal].2
[normal]              
[normal]Consideration of introducing a 
[normal]“presumption of guilt” [bold]law, such as operates in other continental European countries, whereby in
[normal] the event of a collision between a cyclists and a motorised vehicle, the driver of the latter is automatically assumed to be 
[normal]at fault, unless it can be proved otherwise. This legislative approach appears to cement an attitude of greater respect for cyclists’ safety and well-being from drivers.
[normal]6.3
[normal]              
[normal]Enshrining in law a requirement for 
[normal]bicycles to be kept in a roadworthy state[bold].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.[bold]              [bold]Cyclists are not necessarily a special case …[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The need to encourage cycling does not mean 
[normal]ignoring others’ rights to fairness and respect. 
[normal]Any message 
[normal]–
[normal] through
[normal] 
[normal]public information films or general government guidance 
[normal]–
[normal] should
[normal] 
[normal]be that with rights come 
[normal]responsibilities, and c
[normal]yclists should be held accountable for their own 
[normal]inap
[normal]propriate cycling in the same way as motorists should be.
