defaultA ye

default as a charity
default, and with many of the larger legislative issues for LGBT people now addressed by this and previous governments, we are nevertheless still seeing the same issues arise for young LGBT people as they struggle to 
defaultsustain
default their lives in their family homes. We maintain that withdrawing the support that currently enables young people to live away from 
defaultunsafe or unsuitable
default family homes will disproportionately affect young LGBT people in a negative way.

defaultThis submissio
defaultn has been drafted at short notice, but AKT staff and trustees are very willing to enter into more detailed discussion with the Select Committee on this and other relevant points.

default&#xa0;defaultOver the past two years, the homelessness sector has seen a 
defaultsignificant 
defaultrise in demand for services. 
defaultThe Rough Sleeper Statistics repor
defaultts for 2011 and 2012 
defaultshowed an aggregate 30
default% rise in street homelessness
default, and statutory acceptances have risen by 24% over the same period (https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-communities-and-local-government/series/homelessness-statistics)
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBy compari
defaultson
default, over the last 3 years
default, AKT has seen a 
default97% rise in new contacts in Londo
defaultn, and a 78% rise in Manchester.
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultMeanwhile, the capacity of the 
defaulthomelessness 
defaultsector is shrinking. 
default Homeless Link reported that 2012 saw reductions in funding for 58% of projects, with frontline staff reductions in 28%. 
default24 night cover services, 22 floating support services, 18 outreach services, 15 
defaultaccommodation services, and 3 day centres closed last y
defaultear. Services reported reduced outcomes for clients in terms of employment (44%) and accommodation (38%). The same period saw LGBT-specific services shrink from 11% to 
defaultjust 
default3% of the sector (

defaultPrevalencedefaultAnecdotal evidence from homelessness services has long maintained that there is a large LGBT youth homeless 
defaultpopulation; t

defaultalso some

defaultsocial research suggesting 
defaulta sizeable disproportion
default of LGBT people in the youth homelessness population
default, particularly in urban areas with LGBT cultural hubs. 
defaultDunne et al (2002) found an estimate of 26% LG
defaultBT people among the y
defaultouth 
defaulthomelessness population from homeless agencies in London
default (this compares to an estimated 9% prevalence of LGBT people among the general population).
default Browne and Davis (2008) found a 
default22% 
defaultprevalence of 
defaulthomelessness among a sizeable sample of LGBT people l
defaultiving and working in Brighton (this compares to around 8% prevalence of homelessness within the general population).
default By contrast, in the US, where state support for homeless people is far lower, the estimated prevalence of LGBT people in t
defaulthe young homeless population is between 25% and 
default40% (
defaultKruks, 1991; Noel and Ochs, 2001; Cochran et al, 2002).

defaultPresenting issuesdefault4.2.1default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHomelessnessdefaultIn 2012-13, 63% of young people in London and 30% of those in Manchester gave homelessness as their primary reason 
defaultfor contacting us. The majority of those who contact AKT, particularly in London, are already homeless or living in an unsustainable situation which will result in imminent homelessness.
default&#xa0;
default4.2.2default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFamily rejectiondefaultThe great majority of young people who contact AKT have faced rejection from their families. Many have been asked to leave their homes on coming out (or being outed, an increasing phenomenon in the age of social media). Some have faced violence and abuse, 
defaultsome face psychological or religious reparative 'therapies' or rituals, forced marriage or corrective rape (see s4.2.3
default and s4.2.4
default, below). Though AKT seeks to reconnect young people with their families wherever it is safe and appropriate to do so, this rem
defaultains a minority of cases. Many young people, once settled and independent after a period of homelessness, do reconnect with their families at some level, but those who are forced to move back home for lack of options elsewhere
default often face the same issues an
defaultd 
defaultagain become homeless because of them.
default&#xa0;
default4.2.3default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDomestic violencedefaultWhile only 6% of young people gave domestic violence as their primary reason for contacting AKT last year, 
defaultmany 
defaultof those who were already or imminently homeless had experienced
default domestic violence. The majority were experiencing violence from family members 
defaultrather than
default from partners, which makes accessing services particularly difficult: though definitions
default of domestic violence
default in homelessness law include familial violence on young
default people, in practice the vast majority of domestic violence services are aimed at women experiencing partner violence; they are not designed for young people of all genders fleeing violence from their 
defaultfamilies
default.
default Domestic violence includes physical, emotiona
defaultl, sexual, psychological, financial and verbal abuse. It is AKT's position that frequently and stridently expressed homophobic, biphobic and transphobic language and attitudes are forms of emotional abuse when experienced by LGBT young people in their fami
defaultly context. Many of 
defaultthose who contact us have experienced several kinds of abuse from their families over a sustained period of time. 
default&#xa0;
default4.2.4default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultForced marriage, religious abuse and 'honour'-based violencedefaultAKT sees a small but steadily growing number of cases where
default young LGBT people have faced increased risks to their safety and wellbeing because of religious and cultural belief. We see a variety of backgrounds in this work, which 
defaultin mainstream provision
default tends to be aimed at British Muslim women. We have seen cases 
defaultof young people from Pentecostal, Jehovah's Witness, Salvation Army and Irish Traveller backgrounds as well as those from Muslim backgrounds. Of these young people the largest 
defaultproportion have 
defaultPentecostal Christian backgrounds. AKT works with these young pe
defaultople to help them find safe and 
defaultpositive
default homes, 
defaultsupportive
default new networks, and legal protection. 
default&#xa0;
default4.2.5default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSexual exploitationdefaultAround 65% of young gay and bisexual men and around 35% of young trans women working with AKT have exchanged sex for a place to stay. Sexua
defaultl exploitation of LGBT young homeless people is common: the lack of relevant sex education, the power imbalance between older and younger people, and the club culture prevalent in LGBT commercial hubs all contribute to a situation in which too often, LGBT 
defaultyoung homeless people are not offered an opportunity to meaningfully consent to safe sex. 
default&#xa0;
default4.2.6default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMental healthdefaultOf the 22% of 
defaultour clients
default who count themselves as disabled, the most commonly reported form of disability is mental 
defaultillness
default. Many of those who do not see themselves as disabled are also in varying levels of mental health distress. 
defaultA considerable amount of research has shown that LGBT people, and particularly LGBT youth, are more vulnerable to mental health difficulties than he
defaultterosexual comparison groups. In particular studies have shown that there are higher rates of attempted suicide and depressive illness in the LGB population (Bagley and Tremblay, 1997, Garofalo et al., 1998, Bagley and D'Augelli, 2000, Webb and Wright, 200
default1, King et al., 2003a). One study of LGB youth report that 39% have attempted suicide compared to 6-10% of the general youth population (Rotherum-Borus et al., 1994); another recent study in Northern Ireland found that 27.1% of young gay or bisexual men ha
defaultd attempted suicide (McNamee, 2006). One study of LGBT youth (some of whom had been homeless) found that 64% of transgender youth had attempted suicide (Carolan and Redmond, 2003)
default.

defaultDebt, sanctions and rent arrearsdefaultThe majority of young people accessing AK
defaultT's services are claiming benefits for at least some of the time they work with us and over the last year, as the value of benefits has fallen below inflation, we have seen young people resort increasingly to expensive forms of credit.  Many have debts fro
defaultm mobile phone contracts; some have payday loans. Without the means to address these issues robustly they will often fall into rent arrears and risk losing their accommodation and making future tenancies far harder to find. At the same time we have begun t
defaulto notice a pattern of benefit sanctions being applied to young homeless people who may be unable to meet the demands of their jobseeking agreements, or attend courses or placements while homeless. Young homeless people on sanctions also soon fall into rent
default arrears, as they are unable to pay the rent contributions which homeless hostels require; we have even seen some cases of young people being evicted from homeless hostels for this reason.

defaultLGBT migrantsdefaultOver the last year, the number of LGBT migrants app
defaultroaching AKT for support has increased significantly, particularly in London. Though relatively few have made asy
defaultlum claims, and most are in the UK on student or working visas, they tend to be strongly motivated to stay by experiences of violence, oppressi
defaulton and discrimination in their home countries.

defaulthousing and homelessness

default can be found here: http://www.metropolitan.org.uk/images/Over-Not-Out.pdf
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultAKT would suggest that given the likely disproportion of LGBT people in the young homeless population, the recent rise in homelessness is leading to a disproportionately large number of young homeless LGBT people who face serious barriers both in services 
defaultand in their ability to reconnect with their families and/ or enter employment or education. Simultaneously, there has been a reduction in LGBT-specific services that might help to address those issues. 
defaultBoth these factors are resulting in a vastly increase
defaultd demand for services like AKT. Young LGBT people face a variety of complex issues and barriers folded in to their experience of family rejection and homelessness; i
defaultt is AKT's 
defaultcontention
default that 
defaultthey
default should not be forced by lack of services or support to retu
defaultrn to homes where they face violence and abuse, including the emotional abuse caused by homophobia, biphobia and transphobia.
