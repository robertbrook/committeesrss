[[[UNISON voices from the frontline]]]                                                                                                                                                        More than 60,000 UNISON members work in the community and voluntary sector. UNISON works hard to ensure that good terms and working conditions of workers in this sector are promoted and are recognised as an important part of providing quality voluntary and community services. UNISON believes that by working together with UNISON, employers, providers and community and voluntary workers we can achieve more in our Community sector.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

[[[                                                     ]]]In November UNISON held a parliamentary roundtable event with organisations from the voluntary and community sector, hosted by the new Shadow Minister for charities, Lisa Nandy MP. The roundtable event focused on the launch of UNISON’s recent report based on a ‘speak out’ survey of over 3,000 community, voluntary and housing workers across the UK.  

[[[Report findings]]]The report exposed services to our most vulnerable people in society as “hanging by a thread” by uncovering dangerously underfunded services leading to hardship and exposing children and the disabled to risk.The survey and report in full can be downloaded in here:https://www.unison.org.uk/upload/sharepoint/On%20line%20Catalogue/21929.pdf&#xa0;UNISON, along with other organisations at the roundtable called, on the Government to have a major rethink on its attitude to the third sector. Its sink or swim philosophy is leading to a struggle for survival. Almost unnoticed by the public, many charities have become increasingly financially dependent on winning contracts from the public sector. Charities increasingly now rely on winning public sector contracts just to survive along with increased marketisation.As austerity has bitten, funding for these contracts has been squeezed to breaking point and UNISON is warning that whilst charities are reputable and trusted by the public they do not have a magic wand, so cuts are putting vulnerable people at risk.Private companies use them as ‘bid candy’ in an effort to improve their chances of winning more public sector business. The whole contracting-out process means that accountability for public services is increasingly at arm’s-length, and this has led to public fears and damaging reports over the quality of services to children and the disabled.The voluntary sector attracts many thousands of dedicated, hardworking staff who know that they won’t be paid big salaries or bonuses but who have a right to expect a fair deal for their clients and themselves. Instead many workers are bearing the brunt of the austerity drive, through damaging cuts to their pay and conditions.&#xa0;                                                                                                                                                      Staff morale has dipped and low pay is endemic, leading to rising levels of personal debt and long-term financial hardship for many in the sector.&#xa0;A worker providing respite services for children with autism, challenging behavior and profound disabilities, said

[[[“Due to financial pressures we have to combine more vulnerable children with children with challenging behavior. It creates an unsafe environment for both the child and the staff. There have ]]]
