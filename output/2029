[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]IOSH positions[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Clause 1 – ‘Health and safety at work: general duty of self-employed persons’ [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“We believe that taking sensible steps to protect yourself, others who you may engage to help you, and the public, is good for the self-employed person, good for their business and good for UK plc...people who are injured or are ill will need support from GPs, NHS and possibly social services. So, it makes economic sense all-round for people to take sensible steps to look after themselves at work.” 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“The Davidson review into the implementation of EU legislation reports that a number of responses highlighted that there could be good reasons to over-implement EU legislation and that the extension of health and safety directives to include the self-employed was an example of this. The Federation of Small Businesses felt that such application was good discipline and the CBI that it would help achieve consistency.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“The actual burden that the regulations currently place upon these self-employed may not be particularly significant due to existing exceptions in some regulations and the limited prospect of these being enforced but it will help reduce the perception that health and safety law is inappropriately applied.” 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This indicates that 
[normal]he believes 
[normal]the issues are 
[normal]not
[normal] [bold]about reality, but about misperceptions, and 
[normal]we recommend they 
[normal]should be addressed through education and awareness-raising.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“We believe the concept of reliably identifying those ‘who pose no potential risk’ to others to be flawed and unworkable and that the current requirements for the self-employed are not onerous and make good business sense. Exemption would give the wrong message and may encourage the unscrupulous to gamble with people’s safety and health.”

[normal]Clauses 50-57 – ‘Legislation no longer of practical use’[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Candidates for repeal are selected on the basis that they are no longer of practical utility. Usually this is because they no longer have any legal effect on technical grounds - because they are spent, unnecessary or obsolete. But sometimes they are selected because, although they strictly speaking do continue to have legal effect, the purposes for which they were enacted either no longer exist or are nowadays being met by some other means.” 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Clauses 58-61 – ‘Exercise of regulatory functions: economic growth’[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“IOSH believes that the proposal to compel health and safety regulators to ‘have regard to growth’, fundamentally misunderstands that good workplace health and safety regulation already supports growth. It not only saves lives; it also supports business and sustains the economy.”
