defaultWhat are the main barriers (e.g. economic, political, regulatory, scientific and social) to developing large-scale integrated CCS projects in the UK and internationally? How can they be overcome?
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are considerable barriers to successful implementation of CCS in the UK. Over the last few decades, public expectations of benefits from the environment in which they live have grown immeasurably, in part this is due to a better personal understandi
defaultng of the physical environment and the part it plays in their lives but is also in part to the increased cultural significance for leisure, social acceptance and its value as inter-generation equity. In parallel to this there has now an automatic and uninf
defaultormed deep cultural shift of enmity toward groups who wish to manipulate this environment for gain. This is 
defaultexpressed
default in emotional and uninformed stances to nuclear power, fracking, 
defaultand potentially CCS. So far, CC
defaultS has not become a focus for anti-science s
defaultentiment but given the shared history and mechanisms it has with both deep nuclear waste storage and shale gas fracking there is great potential for public mistrust in carbon storage.
default&#xa0;
defaultPolitical barriers potentially fall into two groups 
default–
defaulta)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe lack of long-
defaultterm policy commitment to cost and infrastructure demands. A very expensive leader project started by one administration could easily become a target for cuts by another.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default“
defaultThe Tyranny of the weak
default” – 
defaultuninformed voters opposed to CCS could produce a power bl
defaultock that unseats local councillors and MP
default’
defaults, therefore dictating otherwise beneficial policy.
default This has happened with respect to nuclear waste facilities and will probably happen in response to fracking.
default&#xa0;
defaultRegulatory barriers are considerable and at present 
defaultnot clearly defined. There are pre-existing international and national law on atmospheric emissions, maritime and ground water pollution but they do not directly address CO
default2
default emissions into the biosphere or geosphere. The legal definition of waste pertainin
defaultg to CO
default2
default is not clear and open to a wide range of interpretations. Ideally CCS legislation will have to be congruent with the existing body of environmental law (some is 200 years old) as well as addressing inter-generational commitments for monitoring, da
defaultmages and decommissioning payments. The legislative body evolving a legislative framework should comprise scientists, environmentalists and legal persons.
defaultScientific barriers can and will be mitigated and/or managed by adequate funding and appropriate regu
defaultlatory frameworks. The question is how much and how intrusive?
default&#xa0;
defaultSocial barriers are the most threatening to CCS projects. Without public backing the government will be called upon to act in a manner that may not be conducive to full and economic applicatio
defaultn of these technologies. Science and society live in a shared environment (literally), however that society is deficit in both scientific knowledge and long-term vision and is becoming increasingly vocal in expressing itself at corporate targets. Without p
defaultroper placement of these technologies in the public psyche CCS may attract the same ire as fracking and nuclear waste (indeed legislation, monitoring and 
defaultinfrastructure is very similar between all three). Potential solutions for this include but are not li
defaultmited to

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIncentives for communities willing to host CCS (and fracking / nuclear waste) infrastructure. These incentives should not be direct payment of monies but rather enhanced amenities. 
defaultLower council tax sends the wrong message although a deal on cost of energy bills from suppliers and not directly from government would help.
default&#xa0;
default2)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAre there any safety issues associated with capturing, transporting and storing carbon dioxide? How could they be
default overcome? Who should have responsibility for ensuring these activities are safe?
default&#xa0;
defaultThe potential risks associated with deep geologic storage of CO
default2
default are well known and the focus of many research projects. In my experience gained with the In Salah Gas CO
default2
default storage project (
defaulthttp://www.insalahco2.com/
default) there are significant obstacles in data acquisition 
defaultand 
defaulttranslating
default the results of these projects to an industrial scale.
default&#xa0;
defaultData acquisition is costly and intrusive. 
defaultGood characterization of a potential site is not limited to geomechanical and fluid flow / poro-perm properties. Hydrogeological studies, soil mapping and ecological surveys must also be undertaken to a level of monitoring that goes beyond current Environm
defaultental Impact Assessment (EIA) standards due to the subtleties of CO
default2
default impact and that CO
default2
default is naturally occurring in the geosphere and biosphere requiring isotopic differentiation. 
defaultThe cost of specialised probes 
defaultand surveys 
defaultfor soil gas and water quality mon
defaultitoring is high
default (millions of dollars)
default. Installation by competent persons is required and regular maintenance is mandatory to ensure quality data. Data collection is also costly either in CAPEX for high-end equipment or 
defaultOPEX in manpower and time over the li
defaultfe of the project for manual collection. 
defaultWe had very good results from InSAR (satellite based ground movement observations) albeit 
default‘
defaultground truthing
default’ 
defaultverification was difficult and costly. While this originally made a very good communication tool correct in
defaultterpretations of nuanced data requires highly trained and experienced persons. These specialist skills are lacking in a general workforce so the work will tend to focus a few people and companies rather than a publically accountable body.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is also th
defaulte question of timescale for monitoring, based on work in Algeria on the Cretaceous aquifer I estimated a minimum monitoring programme of seventy (70) years
default as a minimum
default. Long-term monitoring to enable a statistically significant level of proper (as in publ
defaultic interest) decision making makes monitoring an inter-generational project.
default This is a major social rather than scientific barrier and will attenuate investment and incubation of the field depending on how the risks are framed by regulation and government 
defaultpolicy.
default Concomitant to this are issues around handover and responsibility as the potential risks will outlive the 
default‘
defaultnormal
default’ 
defaultlifespan of a commercial concern. Depending on the site, pollution transport associated with CCS activities can be a very slow proces
defaults (e.g. movement of heavy minerals, CO
default2
default polluted water, arsenic related to corrosion etc.)
default so it is possible that plumes of pollution may n
defaultot be identified for many years and only become apparent when the 
default‘
defaultpolluter
default’ 
defaultis no longer in business. This invalidat
defaultes the current 
default‘
defaultpolluter pays
default’ 
defaultmodel for environmental pollution control.

default3)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCould the successful development of CCS improve international efforts to mitigate climate change? What role could UK CCS play in this?
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultYes. The work of Socolow et al. 
default on 
default‘
defaultwedges
default’
default, shows the potential for CCS to impact on climate change. The question that needs clarification is at what cost and are other equally as effective alternatives cheaper? In my opinion there are, but they require the mobilization to action of so
defaultcieties 
defaultto make small personal changes. If each of the 7 billion people on the 
defaultplanet make a single carbon negative action it will have a great impact. Unfortunately, enabling this 
defaultis very difficult in a consumerist 
defaultand highly politicized 
defaultsociety. Where CC
defaultS has an advantage
default,
default is that action, taken by a relative few, 
defaultwill
default have a global impact.
default&#xa0;
defaultFor incubating CCS, the leadership of the UK in this field, and the UK reputation for scientific excellence will enhance our quaternary knowledge economy. UK CCS leade
defaultrship will create confidence, that confidence, will sway other countries, particularly non-OECD countries with emerging fossil fuel based economies to practice CCS.
default There are also spin off technologies from CCS that will be applicable to both nuclear waste
default and shale gas fracking industries to make them safer, more cost effective and potentially more consumer friendly.
default&#xa0;
defaultEndnote
defaultMy comments bridge both science research, public acceptance and environmental policy. Please let me know if you would like to 
defaultdiscuss these issues further.
