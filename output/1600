[normal]Executive Summary[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Statement of competency[bold]My comments below are based on 
[normal]experience gained
[normal] as Fieldwork and Operations Coordinator (2008 
[normal]– 
[normal]2013) on the BP, Statoil and Sonatrach joint venture In Salah Gas CCS project. My academic and research qualifications are based on BSc. Hons Combined Science (Geology), MSc. Earth &amp; Environmental Science, M
[normal]Sc. Science &amp; Society, BA Hons (Open) focussed on environmental policy and a soon to be completed MA in education focussed on societal and adult learning. 
[normal]I am a fellow of the Geological Society of London (F.G.S.) and a member of the Energy Institute (E.I.
[normal]). Currently I am an independent consult on CCS, 
[normal]Alternative Energy, S
[normal]hale
[normal] Gas (f
[normal]racking
[normal])
[normal] and public acceptance issues relating to science and technology. 
[normal]My primary research 
[normal]interests are
[normal] scientific
[normal], regulatory
[normal] and social aspects of long-term environmental monitoring and inter-generational equity and sustainability. 
[normal]I was part of the team who conducted technical appraisals for the UK Government CCS Commercialisation Competition in 2013.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The following
[normal] comments 
[normal]are brief with respect to agreements on confidentiality made to clients (BP Alternative Energy and Senergy
[normal]) and research not yet completed.
[normal] The comments in this document are the basis for a PhD research proposal under discussion for funding.

[normal]Evidence for [bold]the Commons Select Committee on Carbon Capture and Storage[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]What are the main barriers (e.g. economic, political, regulatory, scientific and social) to developing large-scale integrated CCS projects in the UK and internationally? How can they be overcome?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are considerable barriers to successful implementation of CCS in the UK. Over the last few decades, public expectations of benefits from the environment in which they live have grown immeasurably, in part this is due to a better personal understandi
[normal]ng of the physical environment and the part it plays in their lives but is also in part to the increased cultural significance for leisure, social acceptance and its value as inter-generation equity. In parallel to this there has now an automatic and uninf
[normal]ormed deep cultural shift of enmity toward groups who wish to manipulate this environment for gain. This is 
[normal]expressed
[normal] in emotional and uninformed stances to nuclear power, fracking, 
[normal]and potentially CCS. So far, CC
[normal]S has not become a focus for anti-science s
[normal]entiment but given the shared history and mechanisms it has with both deep nuclear waste storage and shale gas fracking there is great potential for public mistrust in carbon storage.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Political barriers potentially fall into two groups 
[normal]–
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The lack of long-
[normal]term policy commitment to cost and infrastructure demands. A very expensive leader project started by one administration could easily become a target for cuts by another.
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]“
[normal]The Tyranny of the weak
[normal]” – 
[normal]uninformed voters opposed to CCS could produce a power bl
[normal]ock that unseats local councillors and MP
[normal]’
[normal]s, therefore dictating otherwise beneficial policy.
[normal] This has happened with respect to nuclear waste facilities and will probably happen in response to fracking.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Regulatory barriers are considerable and at present 
[normal]not clearly defined. There are pre-existing international and national law on atmospheric emissions, maritime and ground water pollution but they do not directly address CO
[normal]2
[normal] emissions into the biosphere or geosphere. The legal definition of waste pertainin
[normal]g to CO
[normal]2
[normal] is not clear and open to a wide range of interpretations. Ideally CCS legislation will have to be congruent with the existing body of environmental law (some is 200 years old) as well as addressing inter-generational commitments for monitoring, da
[normal]mages and decommissioning payments. The legislative body evolving a legislative framework should comprise scientists, environmentalists and legal persons.
[normal]Scientific barriers can and will be mitigated and/or managed by adequate funding and appropriate regu
[normal]latory frameworks. The question is how much and how intrusive?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Social barriers are the most threatening to CCS projects. Without public backing the government will be called upon to act in a manner that may not be conducive to full and economic applicatio
[normal]n of these technologies. Science and society live in a shared environment (literally), however that society is deficit in both scientific knowledge and long-term vision and is becoming increasingly vocal in expressing itself at corporate targets. Without p
[normal]roper placement of these technologies in the public psyche CCS may attract the same ire as fracking and nuclear waste (indeed legislation, monitoring and 
[normal]infrastructure is very similar between all three). Potential solutions for this include but are not li
[normal]mited to
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Formalising sustainability as a subject in the national curriculum using in part, visiting experts outside the traditional teaching hierarchy.
[normal]d)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Undertaking a government media strategy placing sustainability topics such as CCS in the public arena 
[normal](ref. the MAFF approach with The Archers (Godfrey Baseley, BBC 1950)).
[normal]e)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Incentives for communities willing to host CCS (and fracking / nuclear waste) infrastructure. These incentives should not be direct payment of monies but rather enhanced amenities. 
[normal]Lower council tax sends the wrong message although a deal on cost of energy bills from suppliers and not directly from government would help.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Are there any safety issues associated with capturing, transporting and storing carbon dioxide? How could they be
[normal] overcome? Who should have responsibility for ensuring these activities are safe?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The potential risks associated with deep geologic storage of CO
[normal]2
[normal] are well known and the focus of many research projects. In my experience gained with the In Salah Gas CO
[normal]2
[normal] storage project (
[normal]http://www.insalahco2.com/
[normal]) there are significant obstacles in data acquisition 
[normal]and 
[normal]translating
[normal] the results of these projects to an industrial scale.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Data acquisition is costly and intrusive. 
[normal]Good characterization of a potential site is not limited to geomechanical and fluid flow / poro-perm properties. Hydrogeological studies, soil mapping and ecological surveys must also be undertaken to a level of monitoring that goes beyond current Environm
[normal]ental Impact Assessment (EIA) standards due to the subtleties of CO
[normal]2
[normal] impact and that CO
[normal]2
[normal] is naturally occurring in the geosphere and biosphere requiring isotopic differentiation. 
[normal]The cost of specialised probes 
[normal]and surveys 
[normal]for soil gas and water quality mon
[normal]itoring is high
[normal] (millions of dollars)
[normal]. Installation by competent persons is required and regular maintenance is mandatory to ensure quality data. Data collection is also costly either in CAPEX for high-end equipment or 
[normal]OPEX in manpower and time over the li
[normal]fe of the project for manual collection. 
[normal]We had very good results from InSAR (satellite based ground movement observations) albeit 
[normal]‘
[normal]ground truthing
[normal]’ 
[normal]verification was difficult and costly. While this originally made a very good communication tool correct in
[normal]terpretations of nuanced data requires highly trained and experienced persons. These specialist skills are lacking in a general workforce so the work will tend to focus a few people and companies rather than a publically accountable body.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is also th
[normal]e question of timescale for monitoring, based on work in Algeria on the Cretaceous aquifer I estimated a minimum monitoring programme of seventy (70) years
[normal] as a minimum
[normal]. Long-term monitoring to enable a statistically significant level of proper (as in publ
[normal]ic interest) decision making makes monitoring an inter-generational project.
[normal] This is a major social rather than scientific barrier and will attenuate investment and incubation of the field depending on how the risks are framed by regulation and government 
[normal]policy.
[normal] Concomitant to this are issues around handover and responsibility as the potential risks will outlive the 
[normal]‘
[normal]normal
[normal]’ 
[normal]lifespan of a commercial concern. Depending on the site, pollution transport associated with CCS activities can be a very slow proces
[normal]s (e.g. movement of heavy minerals, CO
[normal]2
[normal] polluted water, arsenic related to corrosion etc.)
[normal] so it is possible that plumes of pollution may n
[normal]ot be identified for many years and only become apparent when the 
[normal]‘
[normal]polluter
[normal]’ 
[normal]is no longer in business. This invalidat
[normal]es the current 
[normal]‘
[normal]polluter pays
[normal]’ 
[normal]model for environmental pollution control.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Could the successful development of CCS improve international efforts to mitigate climate change? What role could UK CCS play in this?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Yes. The work of Socolow et al. 
[normal] on 
[normal]‘
[normal]wedges
[normal]’
[normal], shows the potential for CCS to impact on climate change. The question that needs clarification is at what cost and are other equally as effective alternatives cheaper? In my opinion there are, but they require the mobilization to action of so
[normal]cieties 
[normal]to make small personal changes. If each of the 7 billion people on the 
[normal]planet make a single carbon negative action it will have a great impact. Unfortunately, enabling this 
[normal]is very difficult in a consumerist 
[normal]and highly politicized 
[normal]society. Where CC
[normal]S has an advantage
[normal],
[normal] is that action, taken by a relative few, 
[normal]will
[normal] have a global impact.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]For incubating CCS, the leadership of the UK in this field, and the UK reputation for scientific excellence will enhance our quaternary knowledge economy. UK CCS leade
[normal]rship will create confidence, that confidence, will sway other countries, particularly non-OECD countries with emerging fossil fuel based economies to practice CCS.
[normal] There are also spin off technologies from CCS that will be applicable to both nuclear waste
[normal] and shale gas fracking industries to make them safer, more cost effective and potentially more consumer friendly.

[normal]My comments bridge both science research, public acceptance and environmental policy. Please let me know if you would like to 
[normal]discuss these issues further.
