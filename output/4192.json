"&#xa0;\nWritten Evidence submitted Anonymously [PHS0047]&#xa0;&#xa0;\nI understand you will not look into individual complaints but welcome the opportunity to provide evidence for your \n“inquiry, entitled,\n \nParliaments Ombudsman Service”\n. I have concerns that some people in authority start with the assumption that complainants who did not have their cases investigated do not have a justified grievance and are simply unhappy they did not get the outcome they wanted. This attitude as justif\nication of why the \nOmbudsman\n investigates so few complaints and on review very rarely finds they made a wrong decision means there will continue to be missed opportunities to improv\ne patient safety. I believe patient safety\n sh\nould be a priority\n of everyone\n involved\n in the Inquiry\n and this basic principle must be addressed.\n&#xa0;\nIt took the hospital 10\n months to conduct a review and respond to my complaint. It took the \nPHSO\n a further 13 months to give me their decision not to investigate. I asked the \nPHSO\n to rev\niew how they made their decision and they\n have\n agreed to take a look. I am now waiting for their response which can take up to 16 weeks. I have given copies and evidence of my complaint to my MP Mr George \nHollingbery\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2. \n \nThere is clear evidence from the notes and response \nletters that a critical blood re\nsult that the hospital stated \n‘altered the clinical context and prompted the response to arrange urgent brain imaging’ was either not reported from the laboratory or \nnot acted upon\n by a clinician. Failure to provide a safety\n system for reporting critical results in\nevitably leads to potentially serious delays in management. The \nOmbudsman\n,\n without evidence made assumptions on timings to justify delays which I find very worrying and only highlighted more concerns of patient safe\nty. They did express concern the hospital made no mention of reporting procedures and said they would share this \ninformation with them. However \nwithout an investigation to find exactly where in the \nsystem the failure happened and provide remedial action\n or\n education\n to\n prevent it happening again\n it\n \ncould easily happen to many other patients.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6\n. \n  \nI would like my points considered with regard to recommendations made in the Baroness \nFritchie\n report regarding benefits to wider public safety which stated that the \nOmbudsman\n should \n‘ensure caseworkers consider the relevance of any indications of service failure not just to the complainant, but to other patients.’ I also\n feel it w\nould be helpful to consider the points\n alongside the evidence given by Dame Julie Mell\nor to your first Inquiry on 11\nth\n June 2013\n. M\ny letter from the \nOmbudsm\nan\n declining to investigate\n was dated 10\nth\n June 2013\n, the day before the Inquiry\n and is therefore \nproof of their working practice at that time\n. \nThe \nOmbudsman\n accepted the recommenda\ntions made by Baroness \nFritchie\n and used them to introduce their new \nstrategy in November 2012. H\nowever following\n the \nOmbudsman’s\n response to\n my complaint I would question how\n effective this\n review and the new strategy have\n been.\n Who is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the recommendations and how is the true\n va\nlue of this or any other review\n measured?\n \nI would be grateful if the P\nASC could give serious consideration to these questions during the inquiry.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
