[normal]David Selkirk – Written evidence[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Draft Deregulation Bill [bold]-  Rights[bold] of Way Section[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]This is a short but important submission suggesting an additional area for deregulation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I live near the Peak District National Park, greatly care for it, and enjoy its beauty as a walker &amp; walk leader.   Unfortunately it has become a magnet and playground for recreational vehicle users - 4x4 drivers &amp; trail bike riders - who come in increasing numbers from across the country and abroad to use its (once) green lanes.   These people (overwhelmingly male) do not come to enjoy the beauty, solitude &amp; natural environment of the National Park.   They come to enjoy the challenge and excitement of machine over nature, of negotiating muddy and boulder-strewn tracks of their own making.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As far as everyone else is concerned, this is not just inappropriate but noisy anti-social behaviour.   It intimidates other users, as well as spoiling their quiet enjoyment.   It destroys the fragile path surfaces, making them difficult and unpleasant for non-vehicle users, and unsightly scars on the landscape.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Peak District National Park Authority is increasingly recognising these problems and is seeking to impose Traffic Regulation Orders prohibiting vehicle use on some of the worst affected routes, but the legal process is absurdly cumbersome, time-consuming and costly.   With all their resources, they are only able to process one or two cases per year.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]"Off-roading" is an increasingly popular activity, perhaps most acute in the Peak District, but a national problem which needs a national solution.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This area of the law is a clear candidate for deregulation, which would not only save public 
[normal]bodies
[normal] considerable time and money but would also result in great social and environmental benefit.
