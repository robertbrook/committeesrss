The 2013 annual report shows the broadcaster has transformed well, but it will likely take several years (and a few governments) to see if the fears of budget cutting and loss of independence due to state control of funding are realised.&#xa0;DecriminalisationNew Media Platforms and the licence fee&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;References BBC Trust Press Release, BBC publishes Annual Report for 2012/13,  BBC Website, (16/07/2013), http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/news/press_releases/2013/annual_report.html (Accessed: 30/11/2013)BBC,The Licence Fee, BBC Website, http://www.bbc.co.uk/annualreport/2013/executive/finances/licence_fee.html, (Accessed: 30/11/2013), para.4 Human Capital, Public service broadcasting now and in the future– audience attitudes, (London, Human Capital, June 2008), p.4 Ibid, p.4 Andrew Graham, ‘Is Broadcasting Just Another Good or Service?’, Is there Still a Place for Public Service Television?
