"Letter from Rt Hon Theresa May MP, Home Secretary, to the Chair of the Committee, 9 December 2013&#xa0;Detention of Filimone Lacanivalu&#xa0;\nThank you for your letter dated 15 November expressing your concerns about\n the treatment of Mr Lacanivalu\n.\n&#xa0;\nI recognise and value the immense sacrifice and contribution made by\n \nmembers of our Armed Forces, including foreign and Commonwealth\n \npersonnel. Their contribution is reflected in the Immigration Rules and\n \nnationality legislation, which enable foreign and Commonwealth personnel to\n \napply to naturalise as a British citizen after five years' service, or alternatively\n \nto apply for settlement after four years' service.\n&#xa0;\nForeign and Commonwealth military personnel are exempt from immigration\n \ncontrol while serving. On discharge, they are given a period of grace of 28\n \ndays to regularise their immigration status and can subsequently apply to\n \nsettle here up to two years after leaving the military, although they are\n \nexpected not to have remained here in breach of immigration laws in that\n \ntime. Mr Lacanivalu did not apply to regularise his stay in the UK for over two\n \nyears.\n&#xa0;\nWhilst immigration officials correctly applied the rules in this case, it is not\n \nclear that Mr Lacanivalu's Army unit correctly explained to him the immigration\n \nprocedures on his discharge. In the light of the particular circumstances of this\n \ncase, I have personally intervened. Mr Lacanivalu was released from\n \ndetention on Friday 15 November and will shortly be granted Indefinite Leave\n \nto Remain in the UK exceptionally outside the Immigration Rules.\n \n&#xa0;\nI instructed UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) to complete an urgent review of\n \nall of the cases of those individuals identified as ex-HM Armed Forces who\n \nare currently detained. The review identified a total of eight former British\n \nArmed Forces personnel in detention. The majority of these (six) are pending\n \ndeportation following serious criminal offences and after obtaining a significant\n \ncustodial sentence. One further individual has been detained following\n \ncurtailment of exemption from immigration control due to drug abuse. The\n \nindividual in the remaining case was discharged from the Armed Forces in\n \n2010 following a failed drugs test. All individuals have been assessed and in\n \neach case continued detention is considered to be both justified and\n \nproportionate.\n&#xa0;\nYou also asked for details of British Army veterans who have been granted\n \nBritish citizenship as well as the number deported in the years since 2008; this\n \ninformation is not available.\n&#xa0;\nThe Rt Hon Theresa May MP\nHome Secretary\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n"
