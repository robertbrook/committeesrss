[[[FACTUAL INFORMATION]]]:&#xa0;

[[[1) School closure]]]: Ulva School was threatened with closure by Argyll and Bute Council in 2010. At that time it had 8 pupils. The closure threat was lifted in 2011 after robust defence by the parents and wider community.&#xa0;

[[[2) Community makeup]]]: currently 86 adults; 21 under-18s&#xa0;

[[[3) Housing availability and ownership]]]:

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[4) Land ownership:]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;

[[[5) House and building plot prices]]]:&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[6) Local lease arrangements]]]: several houses (and one business) are let on 1988 Short Assured Tenancies, which default to month to month tenure (with two months notice to quit) after the initial 6 months term, giving no security to households or the affected business in an area where there are effectively no alternative homes or premises available.&#xa0;It is my opinion that month-to-month tenancy arrangements can cause tenants a high level of insecurity and stress, especially in an area with no or very little alternative accommodation.

[[[ Ferry Community Development Plan]]]:&#xa0;A Community Development Plan has been created by the Ulva Ferry Local Development Officers (part of the Growth at the Edge project), via a process of community consultation. I have identified the following areas of our Community Development Plan which I believe are directly affected by issues relating to land reform:&#xa0;

[[[A)]]] 

[[[Affordable Housing]]] –&#xa0;It is my opinion that having even a little community-owned land could allow development of affordable housing, complete with a housing chain to allow all ages to live in the community. This housing chain is severely lacking at this time in our area.  This would avoid the complexities involved with working with third-party landowners, who may have their own set of issues and constraints.&#xa0;The acquisition of land could be encouraged by tax breaks for sale or gifts of land to communities.&#xa0;Housing and land burdens placed on such homes or land would ensure continued affordability in perpetuity and prevent profiteering.&#xa0;In our opinion the Woodland Croft model as pioneered by the North West Mull Community Woodland Company is a good working model of community land ownership, allowing young people to build starter homes and remain within their home community.

[[[B)]]] 

[[["Tenant / Landlord relations"]]] –&#xa0;It is my opinion that community factoring may provide a more direct, rapid, accessible and 'comfortable' means for tenants to explore issues they may be experiencing.&#xa0;There should be clear, readily-accessible information for tenants regarding their tenants' rights.It is my opinion that month-to-month tenancy arrangements can cause tenants a high level of insecurity and stress, especially in an area with no or very little alternative accommodation.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[C)]]] 

[[[Economic development]]] –&#xa0;It is my opinion that there should be clear requirements / incentives for upkeep of vital community infrastructure, e.g. a law specifically to identify and protect core assets essential for survival of the economy of a community. There should be a body to advocate for communities should there be no amicable means of engagement and only as a last resort should there be need for measures such as additional taxation or compulsory purchase.&#xa0;Community ownership of land and core community assets would allow community self-determination and security and encourage economic development.&#xa0;

[[[D)]]] 

[[[Energy]]] –&#xa0;It is my opinion that having even a little community-owned land could allow greater potential for community-based energy projects without the need to involve private landowners.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACTION]]]:&#xa0;1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Increased support for community land ownership and self-governance as this provides opportunities and resilience in the following areas:&#xa0;2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Tax breaks for the sale or gift of land or assets to communities to encourage philanthropy&#xa0;3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Independent assessment process to identify - and clear requirement in law to upkeep - vital community infrastructure / core assets, with recourse to additional taxation or compulsory purchase as a last resort should this fail to happen&#xa0;4)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Advocacy / mediation service for communities in need where engagement with landowners or core asset-holders has failed&#xa0;5)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Abolition of month-to-month style tenancy arrangements in favour of longer tenures, particularly in rural areas&#xa0;6)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Support for community factoring&#xa0;7)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Community accountability of land ownership via external auditing / independent appraisal of level of benefit of land and asset management to the local community, with subsequent  recourse to advocacy / action in case of poor or negative results. Examples of factors assessed could be: housing; agricultural use; sporting use; supporting and sustaining the local community. Examples of actions which could be taken could be: increased taxation or compulsory purchase&#xa0;8)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Increased support for educational initiatives e.g. Forest Schools and Crofting Connections which expand young people’s sense of relationship to land and community&#xa0;9)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Increased access to information on land reform for communities and school children to increase awareness of the opportunities (and in some cases pitfalls) associated with community land ownership, plus support for inter-community networking and mentoring&#xa0;10)&#xa0; New company structures or legal states to allow a community group to function outwith the "Company Limited By Guarantee" vehicle could strengthen the culture of community land / asset management  groups. These could, for example, also function as SCIOs / Community Interest Groups or Scottish Charities&#xa0;11)&#xa0; Land value taxation

[[[COMMENTS SPECIFICALLY RELATING TO THE COMMITTEE'S TERMS OF REFERENCE:]]]&#xa0;These are the questions I feel relate best to my community. Most of the answers cross-refer to previous comments.&#xa0;&#xa0;A. Economic and community development in rural areas is highly-dependent on access to land for housing and business use. If land owners, large or small, are unwilling for whatever reason/s to release land for community development there is little prospect of that community developing. Some landowners are extremely pro-active and supportive of their local communities whilst it appears that others have no interest.&#xa0;&#xa0;A. “Crofting communities” have an absolute right-to-buy. Other non-crofting communities can register an interest in pre-emptive right-to-buy but in reality there is often little chance of land coming onto the market. Even a little land could in some cases make an enormous difference to the future of communities and in light of the successes of existing community ownership groups, any means of increasing the chances of obtaining even a small amount of land should be considered positively, e.g. providing tax breaks for landowners who sell or gift land to communities. Clearly, positive, mutual engagement between communities and landowners should be sought and explored, but where this fails, even after intervention of a suggested independent “Advocacy / Mediation” body - and if there is independent assessment that this land is necessary for the community's survival - a means of compulsory purchase could be used. This applies equally to core infrastructure e.g. piers, airstrips and accesses. It is conceivable that some landowners who may be struggling to maintain their land and associated infrastructure may even welcome the opportunity to receive tax breaks in return for releasing land and other assets to communities to either manage or own.&#xa0;&#xa0;A. Yes, this could be extremely helpful. Most community groups are made up of hard-pressed volunteers who may struggle to find the resources of manpower, time and money required to pursue obtaining land for community use. “Starter” tenancies could bring in a new generation of younger people and families to rural communities, strengthening and enhancing those communities. In this area, for example, even one new family could make a big difference to the community and the school.&#xa0;&#xa0;A. We are uncertain of how easy it is but it certainly should be facilitated as far as possible.&#xa0;&#xa0;A. Revenue from Land Value Tax raised in addition to council tax and business rates could be ring-fenced to fund community development projects and other common good projects within the area of origin.&#xa0;There is a very big need for land reform especially in areas that are fragile with regards to a sustainable population. I hope that the points raised are taken into account.&#xa0;November 2013
