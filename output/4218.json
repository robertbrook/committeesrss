"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Axion Recycling Ltd.BackgroundAxion\n Recycling Ltd is a well-known recycler of plastics in the UK materials resource recovery sector. \n \nAxion\n \nis\n different from most recyclers because not only do we operate our own reprocessing plants in Manchester, but we also run a leading technical consultancy business to support the advancement of developments in the use of innovative technologies to recover value from waste materi\nals, with a particular specialis\nation in waste plastics recycling.\n \n Over the past \nten\n years we have delivered multiple projects for WRAP\n,\n D\nefra and other clients\n in order to keep pushing forward on the advancement of methodologies to sort, separate and recycle high-quality materials from various waste streams.\nPlastic \nf\nilms \nr\necycling \ne\nxpertise\nIn the area of flexible packaging films, which includes all types of plastic bags, \nAxion\n Consulting ha\ns\n recently delivered a large-scale project \nfor WRAP \nto \ndemonstrate\n that it is technically feasible to sort and separate polyethylene\n (PE)\n films from a very large sample (600 tonnes) of UK collected \nmunicipal \ndry\n \nmixed recyclables\n. \n \nThis project employed the latest types of automated sensor sorting equipment to separate out a stream of PE-type plastic films which were then cleaned and recycled back into high-quality polymer pellets.  The output plastic was made into blown-film black refuse sacks at a &gt;50% addition level to virgin polymers, proving that the technology already exists to capture and recycle this huge waste stream in the UK market\n.\n \n \nWe estimate that flexible post-consumer films account for over 500,000 tonnes of waste plastics packaging \nconsumption in the UK each year\n.\nAxion\n \nis\n continuing to progress the above \nwork\n with WRAP, by demonstrating that PE pellets recovered from waste plastic films can be used in a wide range of other applications, such as \nroto\n-moulded components for use in the automotive, construct\nion\n and outdoor leisure equipment markets.\n \n One product of particular note was a moulding of a retail store clothes mannequin that was \nsuccessfully \nmade with 50% recycled polyethylene; we think this proves that the recycling of plastic from retail shopping bags and other packaging films should be forming a significant proportion of the UK’s plastic recycling tonnage as part of our effort to meet the high and increasing targets set by D\nefra\n for plastic packaging\n.\nCollection \ng\nrowth\nThe evidence from recently published data by RECOUP\n about the level of\n collected tonnages across the three\n main groupings of household plastic \npackaging \nwaste: bottles; pots, tubs &amp; trays (PTT) and films, indicate that consumer\ns\n will place a large proportion of used packaging items into the kerbside recycling system in their locality as soon as they are instructed to do so by their local \nauthority\n.\n \n This point is supported by the rapid growth in the collection of PTTs over the past \nthree\n years, where we can see many \nlocal authorities\n opting to include ‘all rigid plastic types’ in their collection system and an associated rapid growth in national tonnage.\n \n \nThere are currently \n244 L\nocal \nA\nuthorities collecting PTTs; in these areas\n \nit is estimated that \n19% of PTT\ns are\n coll\nected, corresponding to 124,000 tonnes of plastic waste per annum\n. \n \nThere is early evidence that plastic packaging films can follow the same upwards trajectory of growth as described here as soon as the infrastructure and sorting facil\ni\nties come on-stream.\nAxion\n would therefore want to impress upon the members of the select committee the importance of ensuring that government interventions into the rapidly growing plastics recycling market are implemented in a manner that encourages ‘\nmore of the same’\n across all packaging types,\n that is\n:\n&#xa0;\nIt is certainly not the right time to be creating more complexity on the mix of packaging film types being placed onto the market by introducing measures that encourage biodegradable films use in carrier bags.\nResponse to the proposalsIn terms of how the proposed measures for plastic carrier bags will impact upon the UK’s recycling market we would\n state our opinions as follows:\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nImpact of the 5p tax on single-use plastic bags\n&#xa0;\nAxion\n \nis\n supportive of a taxation scheme that encourages the principle of ‘REDUCE’ in the waste hierarchy and clearly a tax on carrier bags at point-of-sale will have the effect of reducing the number of bags given out to shoppers.  However, the reduction in materials consumption for a particular purpose should apply across ALL materials (plastic, paper, textile, other) in relation to their total lifecycle impact per item used. \n \nIn fact, it can be argued that those product types needing the most urgent reduction are the ones that use the most materials with the highest carbon impact per unit of consumption.\n \n It therefore seems wrong from \nAxion’s\n viewpoint to single out ‘\nplastic\n carrier bags’ as a product that needs special tax measures to reduce the numbers used. \n \nIf this tax creates a switch over to other materials, then it is vital that each \nunit of alternative product (for example\n, a paper carrier bag) does\nn't\n represent a change for the worse on a total carbon impact basis.\n&#xa0;\n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nExemption for \nb\niodegradable \nc\narrier bags \n&#xa0;\nAxion\n cannot support any preferential treatment for biodegradable polymer types to be used in the m\nanufacture of plastic carrier bags.  There are several reasons for this:\n&#xa0;\ni)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe K.I.S.S. Principle \n-\n \nt\nhe UK’s plastic recycling industry has developed in parallel with the implementation of vastly improved collection systems from all households across the country. \n \nThe waste \nmanagement \nsector and the plastic reprocessing sector are entirely dependent upon the continued gr\nowth in this collection method.  I\nn fact it is often called the ‘urban mine’ from which the above industrial companies are extracting material resources of significant economic value.\n \n The future successful growth of this sector relies upon a long-term partnership developing between the organisations involved in the packaging supply chain.\n \n The focus of all players involved in this circular materials flow should be to simplify and standardise on the selection of materials used to make different types of retail packaging products. \n \nWe have witnessed how this cross-industry approach can deliver huge success in the UK’s \ntrack-record on\n plastic bottle recycling. \n \nThe water, soft drinks and the dairy sectors have worked together to create a very successful circular economy for HDPE \n(high density polyethylene) \nand PET \n(polyethylene \nterephthalate\n) \npolymer types used to make plastic bottles. \n \nSupported by the good work of WRAP, the drinks sector ha\ns\n created clear guidelines for ‘good design’ of packaging that helps to simplify the range of material types used\n and improve the recyclability of these items\n. \n \nThis has enabled the sorting and separation plants handling these items to build efficient process plants yielding a high recycling rate and profitable commercial results. \n \nThe conclusion from this brief history of successful recycling must be\n -\n \nkeep the mix of materials simple and then the industry can operate efficiently to deliver ‘green growth’.&#xa0;ii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIncompatibility -\n \nt\nhere are many different types of polymer used to make packaging products. \n \nSeveral of these polymer variants are not compatible with each other in terms of blending and recycling by means of thermal melt processing. \n \nThis means that very sophisticated process plants have been developed to enable the rapid sorting of plastic polymer types to be carried out before plastic waste items can be sent for thermal extrusion processing.\n \n Very small concentrations of incompatible polymer types in the bulk sorted plastic can have disastrous impacts upon the quality and usability of the recycled polymer compounds. \n \nThe plastic \nreprocessors\n of Great Britain are constantly fighting against the inclusion of incompatible polymer types into any particular stream of sorted materials.  Flexible plastic packaging films are most often made from polyethylene \n(\nPE\n)\n polymer type.\n \n In the case of thin-walled, single-use carrier bags PE is almost exclusively the ‘material of choice’ as a result of it\ns\n extraordinarily high strength for very thin film thickness. \n \nThe successful recycling of the UK’s carrier bags will be entirely dependent upon the ability of \nreprocessors\n to sort out a high yield of PE polymer types.\n \n Therefore, why would anybody propose creating an economic driver that encourages the use \nof \na totally incompatible material into this waste stream?\nBiodegradable polymers are often based upon ‘natural polymers’ such as corn-starch and \nPLA’\ns\n (\npolylactic\n acids)\n.\n \n These materials breakdown on exposure to moisture and oxygen to b\necome composted waste products -\n CO\n2\n, water and nitrogen residues.\n \n It would be very, very disruptive to \nthe \nquality of recycled plastics made from collected plastic films IF these biodegradable materials are allowed to be mixed into th\ne municipal waste\n collection system.\n  They are not compatible with polyolefin plastics and recent studies by Plastics Recyclers Europe have proven that even at very low levels of biodegradable contamination the physical properties of the recycled materials are severely degraded. \n&#xa0;\niii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n‘Cradle-to-Cradle’ -\n \nt\nhe book of this title written by Michael \nBraungart\n and Will\ni\nam \nMcdonough\n in \n200\n2 \nis a seminal description of the principles of the circular economy in an industrialised economy\n. \n \nThe thinking extolled in this book has formed the basis of the visionary opinions promoted by the Ellen Mac\nA\nrthur \nF\noundation and other leading experts. \n \nThe book explains how natural systems in the Earth’s environment allow a circular flow of materials in, for example, the growth cycles of a tree. \n \nSince mankind learned how to extract and refine materials describe\nd as ‘technical nutrients’ (for example,\n steel, glass, plastic) another parallel,\n \ncircular\n material flow exists -\n that of material recycling. \n \nThere is only one point from the book to repeat here:\n \nDo not allow the mixture of biodegradable nutrients with technical nutrient\ns\n in the waste recycling system\n.\nClearly the proposed exemption for the use of biodegradable bags would do just that\n.\n&#xa0;\nConclusion&#xa0;In conclusion\n,\n \nAxion\n Recycling can state that:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe wish to propose an alternative way in which \nthe \nUK \nG\novernment can have a positive influence upon the plastic carrier bag market. \n \nIt is our strong belief that legislative drivers should be ‘carrots’ as well as ‘sticks’ if they are going to reward those organi\ns\nations that change their behavio\nu\nr in a desirable manner. \n \nFrom our detailed understanding of the technology used for sorting of waste packaging items and the extrusion of those sorted polymers via thermal processing, we believe that by far the best route here is to positively encourage the demand for recycled plastics to be used to make durable, thicker wall shopping bags designed for multiple use. \n \nTherefore we would strongly suggest that part of the ‘plastic bag levy system’ includes a clause that allows bags which have been made with a high percentage of recycled content to qualify for a pro-rata reduction in the bag tax in direct relation to the percentage of recycled content that they contain. \n \nThis would mean that a plastic bag with 50% recycled content (demonstrated in an auditable manner along the supply chain) would only have to pay 0.5 x 5 = 2.5p tax per bag.\n&#xa0;\nThis simple adjustment to the proposed levy would create a ‘carrot’ to reward those retailers who specify high recycled film content in their store bags, while leaving the ‘stick’ effect to drive down the use of virgin plastics in single-use carrier bags.\n9 December 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.wrap.org.uk/sites/files/wrap/MST1445_Plastic_Film_Breifing_Note_final%20for%20web.pdf\n \nRecoup Household Plastics Collection Survey 2013\n \nMichael \nBraungart\n and \nWilliam McDonough\n, \nCradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things\n, published 200\n2\n.\n"
