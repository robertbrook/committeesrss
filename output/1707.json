"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Royal College of Surgeons (WSC057)&#xa0;1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis\n evidence sets out the Royal College of Surgeons’ (RCS) view on the issues facing women in surgical careers, and proposals to improve uptake. \n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTraditionally\n,\n surgery has been a male-dominated career\n. C\nhanging attitudes and support structures will be \nthe \nkey to ensuring the next generation of surgeons include \na greater proportion of \ntalented women. \n&#xa0;2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is no hard evidence that explicit barriers exist for women who cho\no\nse surgery as a career. However, comparatively small numbers of wom\nen choose surgery as a \ncareer and for those that do, few become consultants. \n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlthough, t\nhe proportion of women choosing surgery, and reaching consultant level is rising year\n-\non\n-\nyear \nthe rise is \nslow and from a low base level.\n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFinland and Sweden have a sig\nnificantly higher proportion of women in surgical specialties\n highlighting \nthat there are some country\n-\nspecific factors for this underrepresentation.\n2.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSurgery is a craft specialty and understandably requires sustained practical as well as theoretical training over many years. The length of training, combined with key elements of surgical training at child-bearing age, can be an important \ndeterrent\n for wo\nmen who may want to have children.\n2.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nR\nesearch shows that a lack of visible role models in surgery may also discourage women from considering surgery, leading them to subconsciously or consciously feel as though they will not ‘fit’.\n2.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThrough national and regio\nnal \ncampaigns and \nevents\n,\n the College supports women in, or considering entering, surgery, \nproviding\n \nadvice,\n practical skills and the opportunity to meet other women pursuing a surgical career. \n2.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAthena SWAN offer a charter for women in science\n,\n and offer m\nedical schools awards if they can demonstrate that they have tak\nen steps working towards\n equality in STEM career progression. The College would like to see the charter extended to \nmedicine\n.\n2.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is vital that \nLess Than Full Time \n(\nLTFT\n)\n \nsurgical trainees receive the same high-quality training as their full time equivalents. We encourage Health Education England to consider how it can support LTFT trainees as part of its review of the tariff for education and training. \n2.9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nComparatively few w\nomen choose surgery as a career, despite ambition, aptitude and little direct discrimination. Women are choosing not to pursue this career due to a lack of positive role models, \nand/\nor potential concerns about work-life balance.\n \nIf surgery does not become \nmore accommodating of flexible working patterns, it will fail to attract the best candidates, male or female. \n&#xa0;3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nS\ntatistics \nfrom the Universities\n and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) \nshow that in 2011 55% of those accepted on to medical \ndegree courses in the UK were women, however in the same year\n just\n 26% of surgical \nspecialty \ntrainees were women, and women made up \nonly\n 8.7% of consultant surgeons.\n \n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor \nfemale \ndoctors\n \nwho \ndo apply to undertake \ncore surgical training (a two year period \nof training in a hospital covering a range of surgical specialties) and specialty surgical training (\na \nsubsequent \nfive or \nsix year\n period of \ntraining in a hospital focuss\ned\n on one surgical specialty) \ndata shows a higher than expected success rate\n in obtai\nning a training post\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFemale applicants\n to training posts\nFemale appointments\n to training posts\nCore surgical training in 2008\n23%\n25%\nCore surgical training in 2009\n29%*\n31%\nSpecialty surgical training in 2008\n16%\n22%**\nSpecialty surgical training \nin 2009\n13%\n15%\n*The increase in proportion of women applying to core posts is statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001).\n**The excess of women appointed over that expected from the numbers applying is significant (p=0.004).\n&#xa0;\nFrom this i\nt is clear that\n fewer w\nomen are choosing surgery as a career, \ndespite aptitude, \nand for those that do\n choose surgery\n, becoming a consultant surgeon is \ncompara\ntively \nrare. \nThis data also shows a significant rate of attrition for women who have completed their core surgical training but \nhave \nnot chosen to progress \ntheir career \nwith specialty surgical training. \n \n3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA recent UK study of newly qualified doctors showed 25% \nof \nfemal\ne doctors expressed interest in a surgical career as oppose\nd to 42% of male doctors. \nReasons included difficulty maintaining family life, limited flexible training,\n and lack of role models. \nIrrespective of \npersonal \ncareer interests, 59% of male and 68% of \nfemale respondents believed surgery was not a career \nwhich welcomed\n women\n.\n3.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBy contrast, general practice - \nwhich is often considered to have more favourable working conditions\n - has recruited a higher proportion of women than men for many years. Since 2001 \nthe proportion of women among general practice\n registrars has been 60-61%.\n3.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, o\nther medical specialties with \nsimilar burdens\n \nto surgery, \nincluding out-of-hours \nrequirements\n have gender ratios approaching parity \nat the point of \nentering \nspecialty\n training\n, for example the percentage of women in \nAccident &amp; Emergency\n is\n 47%\n,\n Paediatrics 42%, Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology 42% and Anaesthetics 40%\n.\n By learning from the \nex\namples of \nthese specialties, surgery should be able to \ntake\n positive \nsteps\n. \n3.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEncouragingly, t\nhe proportion of women choosing surgery\n, and reaching consultant level\n \nis rising year\n-\non\n-\nyear\n albeit \nslowly \nand from a low base level \n(\nfrom \n4.7% of the total in \n2001\n to 8.7% in 2011\n \n)\n.\n \nT\nhe College hopes to support this \ncontinuing \ntrend \nand recognises that G\novernment\n, medical schools, training establishments and NHS Trusts\n also have a role to play. \n3.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWomen are also underrepresented in leadership positions such as examiners and clinical directors, representing \nthe need for a \nculture\n change\n.\n3.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInternationally, the general trend of finding the highest proportion of women in primary care specialties or publ\nic health, and the lowest in acute medical and surgical specialties, remains the same.\n \nHowever, Finland and Sweden have a significantly higher proportion of women in surgical specialties\n (for some, women constitute 50% of the workforce)\n,\n highlighting that \nthere are some country specific factors for this underrepresentation.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is no hard evidence that explicit barriers exist for women \nwho cho\no\nse surgery as a career. \nR\neports of bias in the recruitment \nsystem\n,\n or\n overt\n \nlack of \nrespect once consultant status is reached\n,\n are relatively rare\n.\n \nHowever, comparatively small numbers of women choose surgery as a career and for those that do\n, few \nchoose to continue up to consultant level.\n4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor more than \n13 years\n the College has worked to understand women’s surgical careers and factors affecting their success. Through national and regional \ncampaigns and \nevents the College supports women in, or considering entering, surgery, starting with workshops for school\n-\nage a\nspiring surgeons. These events provide knowledge, practical skills and the opportunity to meet women pursuing a surgical career. A network of members providing information and advice on all topics affecting women in surgery or considering a surgical career\n, including a flexible training advisor\n,\n is also \nan \navailable\n asset\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nTraining4.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSurgery is a craft specialty and understandably requires sustained \npractical as well as theoretical \ntraining over many years. \n4.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA\n me\ndical graduate \nembarking\n on\n \nsurg\nical training\n \ncan expect two years of \nhospital-based \nfoundation training covering a range of specialties, followed by two \nyears of core surgical training, \nfollowed by \nfive or\n six years of specialty training\n \nfor their chosen type of surgery. \n4.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nApplication to specialty tr\naining \ngenerally \noccurs \nfour or five\n \nyears \nafter gra\nduation (age 27-30, based on a five\n year medical degree). A place in \na \nspecialty training \nprogramme \nguarantees (subject to competence) permanent training posts until training is complete. When training is\n complete\n \n(approximately ten\n years after graduation) they may apply for senior posts such as consultant positions or, more likely, further \nspecialty \ntraining. \n4.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe length of training, combined with \nkey elements of surgical training at child-bearing age\n, can be an important \ndeterrent\n for women who may want to have children.\n4.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn order to provide doctors with the necessary broad experience\n,\n surgical training also requires movement between multiple hospitals\n,\n often in different geographical locations, with i\nnflexible \nand unpredictable \non-call requirements. For both men and women, this knowledge, and the effect this may have on \nfamily life\n, may play a role in a decision to pursue \nsurgery as a career choice\n. \n4.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLess Than Full Time (LTFT) training \nis the means by \nwhich doctors and dentists undertake training when they are unable to work and train full time\n. However, LTFT training \nis\n available subject to eligibility, resource and training capacity of the relevant programme\n, and will \nnecessarily \nadd years to the tr\naining programme. \n4.9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOnly 7% of trainees across the medical professions are LTFT\n, and in the \nmost recent \nannual national training survey, the \nGeneral Medical Council (\nGMC\n)\n f\nou\nnd 86.4% of LTFT trainees are women\n. For surgery,\n LTFT training\n is more unusual\n,\n \nin 2011\n Medical Education England statistics showed there to be\n ju\nst 78\n LTFT trainees in surgery\n out of a total \nof \n4,381, \nhighlighting\n how hard these posts are to \nsecure\n, and h\now disproportionally women are affected\n as a result\n.\n With statistics \nnot publically available \non the\n \napplication for\n,\n and availability of\n,\n these training posts, the College would encourage t\nhe C\nommittee \nto ask Health Education England \nfor this information. \n4.10.\n&#xa0; \nLTFT training can be arranged as:\nThe most common arrangement is the ‘slot share’ system. \nHowever, in surgery it can be extremely difficult to find another trainee who will be seeki\nng the same specialist training\n because of low overall numbers\n in certain specialties\n.\n Supernumerary posts ar\ne the most effective arrangement for LTFT training and should be available more routinely.\n In addition,\n while it is vital that part-time trainees achieve the same competencies as those training full-time, the\n system \ncan limit\n \nhow much training \nthe LTFT tra\ninee \ncan \nundertake\n,\n w\nhich can increase the time spent training (already at 10 years) by more than they would ideally like. \n&#xa0;Role models4.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUniversity of Exeter research shows \nthat a lack of visible role models in surgery may also discourage \nwomen\n from considering surgery\n, leading them to subconsciously or consciously feel as though they will not ‘fit’.\n4.12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe\n research shows that when women think of a surgical consultant they think of a man with traditionally masculine traits, and this is then reinfo\nrced by a lack of women at consultant level.\n \nThe \nresearchers\n believe that where a woman perceives her attributes differ from these traits, they perceive that they are less likely to succeed in surgery which reduces career ambition and job satisfaction.\n4.13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo \nattract more women to a career in surgery the \nresearchers \nbelieve the importance is less about changing the career itself and more about changing some women’s negative perception that they do not have what it takes to succeed. \n4.14\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe College\n, through its Wom\nen in Surgery team\n,\n \nhelps to raise awareness and support women in surgical careers. This team\n has piloted a \n‘near peer’ mentoring scheme for women \nwhere medical \nstudents were \nmentored by foundation-level \ntrainees, who were in turn mentored but \ntrainees at \nthe level above themselves, continuing up to consultant level\n. The scheme was well received and investigations are underway to consider\n how\n feasible it would be to roll\n out on a larger\n scale\n. The College has an important role to play in providing mentoring\n to trainees and is committed to ensuring it does so in the future.\n&#xa0;5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nComparatively few women choose surgery as a career, despite ambition, aptitude and \nrelatively \nlittle direct discrimination. Women are choosing not to pursue this career \ndue to \na \nlack of positive role models, \nand/\nor potential concerns about work-life balance. \n5.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf surgery does not become more accommodating of flexible working patterns\n,\n it will fail to attract the best candidates\n, male or female. \n&#xa0;Recommendations for Government5.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernment support should be actively offered for initiatives supporting women in areas where they are underrepresented. \n5.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nAthena SWAN \ncharter, launched in 2005 and\n funded by the Equality Challenge Unit, The Royal Society, The Biochemical Society and th\ne Department of Health\n,\n exists to advance the representation of women in science, engineering and technology. Higher education institutions can earn gold, silver and bronze awards if they can demonstrate that they are aware of, and have taken steps working\n towards, equality in STEM career progression. The College would like to see the charter extended to medicine.\n5.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLTFT training must be supported, and operate in a system where it is expected. \nF\nunding for these positions\n, particularly supernumerary posts\n is \nnot always available and \nwe encourage the Committee to explore why this is the case and how this can be \nrectified. \nThe \nG\novernment must consider innovative ways to fund these posts to ensure \nemployers\n are not disadvantaged by taking LTFT trainees on. \n5.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRestructuring the funding model to ensure there can be flexibility in the amount of t\nime a graduate spends training\n,\n perhaps by incentivising \nsupernumerary\n posts as \nthe slot-share model\n can lead to the restriction of\n training \nto 50% or 60% w\norking patterns\n,\n \nwhereas many trainees would find it more useful to work\n 70% or 80%\n.\n \n5.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is vital that LTFT surgical trainees receive the same high-quality training as their full time equivalent\ns. Ensuring funding ‘follows the trainee’ \nwould help to encourage funding for \ntailored LTFT\n rotations rather than \nhaving\n to take part in \na broader \nstanda\nrd programme designed for \nfull-time \ntrainees\n.\n We encourage Health Education England to \nconsider\n how it can support LTFT trainees as part of its r\neview of the tariff for education and training.\n \n5.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn 2009 the Department of Health report \nWomen doctors: making a difference \ndetailed a number of recommendations including: \ni\nmprov\ning\n access to mentoring and career advice; encouraging women in leadership; im\nprov\ning\n access to part-time working and flexible training\n;\n and improving access to childcare. The Committee may want to consider the progress \nof\n these recommendations.\n18\n \n&#xa0;\nRecommendations for medical schools5.9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUniversity is a key moment to ensure all medical graduates actively consider surgery, and are fully informed about the pros and cons of surgery as a \ncareer\n.\n \nMentoring, and \ncontact with positive role models\n,\n should be offered for all medical graduates.\n \n5.10.\n&#xa0; \nSur\ngery \nin the \nundergraduate curriculum\n \nis\n taught \nvariably across the UK\n. Having \nmore \ndefined courses and outcomes \nacross institutions \nwould \nenable \nall \nmedical students to make informed decisions\n about their future career choices\n.\n \n5.11.\n&#xa0; \nUniversities and medical \nschools should actively seek an Athena SWAN award\n19\n confirming that \nthe institution is aware of, and has taken steps working towards equality in STEM career progression. In 2011 the Chief Medical Officer announced that the National Institute \nof Health Rese\narch (NIHR) would only expect to shortlist medical schools for funding if a \ngold or \nsilver Athena SWAN award was in place. The College would like to see all medical schools seek these awards\n,\n regardless of whether they are applying for research f\nu\nnding fro\nm the NIHR.  \n \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;August\n 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://surgicalcareers.rcseng.ac.uk/wins/statistics\n Urology and Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Surgery are five year training programmes\n SA McNally, \nSurgical training: still highly competitive but still very male, \nAnn R Coll Surg Engl (suppl) 2012; 94: 53-55\n J.
