The smelter has \ncontributed\n 3-6% of the country’s GDP each year.  It employs 1200 people and 600 contractors directly and contributes to indirect job creation of approximately 6500 people.  Thousands o\nf people have trained at Mozal \nand \n93% of its employees are from Mozambique. The government is a shareholder and receives a proportional share of dividends.\n&#xa0;\nLast year, \nMozal\n spent approximately $460 million with local businesses, including over 150 small \nsuppliers that were established with support from Mozlink – an enterprise development program implemented by BHP Billiton to help spread the benefits of development. \n \nThe construction of Mozal also supported the construction of new power lines bringing pow\ner from South Africa to Mozambique \nproviding reliable power to\n the south of \nthe country supporting development more broadly.\n&#xa0;\nThe company’s successful healthcare programs have reduced the incidence of malaria in the local community from over 85% to less than 6%; and cut the HIV infection rate from 19% to 5%.  \n&#xa0;\nIn addition, \nThe Mozal Community Development Trust (MCDT) was establi\nshed by BHP Billiton in 2000 \nand\n has initiated roughly 200 projects, focusing on quality of life, increasing access to healthcare, clean water and sanitation and poverty alleviation.\n&#xa0;\nWorking with NGOs\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nConclusion\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Trends in the Mining and Metals Industry, International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), 2012\n Excludes employee taxes\n Transparency in Corporate Reporting, Transparency International, 2012\n"
