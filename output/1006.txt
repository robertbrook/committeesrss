[[[THE RIGHT TO VOTE AS A FUNDAMENTAL POLITICAL RIGHT ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]“In other democratic countries, the status of citizenship embodies the basic constitutional concept that by virtue of that status:(1) the individual has legally enforceable rights which are fundamental in the sense that they have a specially protected status in domestic law in relation to the public authorities of the state; the individual has legal duties towards the state and the community; and (3) the state has legally enforceable duties towards the individual. However, in the absence of an enforceable, constitutionally protected Bill of Rights, citizens of the United Kingdom do not have procedurally entrenched fundamental rights in relation to the state. In the absence of a written constitution, nor do any English laws define the principles governing either the duties of the individual to the state or the state to the individual. &#xa0;“Nevertheless, a range of statutory provisions and common law rules together give the individual … the principal civil and political rights or liberties usually associated with citizenship”.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“A convicted person during the time that he is detained in a penal institution in pursuance of his sentence … is legally incapable of voting at an parliamentary or local election.”&#xa0;&#xa0;“it should be part of a convicted prisoner’s punishment that he loses rights and one of them is the right to vote.”&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“The high contracting parties undertake to hold free elections at reasonable intervals by secret ballot, under conditions that will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people on the choice of legislature.”&#xa0;&#xa0;“any departure from the principle of universal suffrage risks undermining the democratic validity of the legislature thus elected and the laws it promulgates. Exclusion of any groups or categories of the general population must accordingly be reconcilable with the underlying purposes of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1.” (§&#xa0;62)&#xa0;&#xa0;“prisoners in general continue to enjoy all the fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed under the Convention save for the right to liberty, where lawfully imposed detention expressly falls within the scope of Article 5 of the Convention.” &#xa0;It also stated that “there is no question, therefore, that a prisoner forfeits his Convention rights merely because of his status as a person detained following conviction. Nor is there any place under the Convention system, where tolerance and broadmindedness are the acknowledged hallmarks of democratic society, for automatic disenfranchisement based purely on what might offend public opinion.” &#xa0;“The severe measure of disenfranchisement must not, however, be resorted to lightly and the principle of proportionality requires a discernible and sufficient link between the sanction and the conduct and circumstances of the individual concerned. The Court notes in this regard the recommendation of the Venice Commission that the withdrawal of political rights should only be carried out by express judicial decision (see paragraph 32 above). As in other contexts, an independent court, applying an adversarial procedure, provides a strong safeguard against arbitrariness.”&#xa0;“section 3 of the 1983 Act remains a blunt instrument. It strips of their Convention right to vote a significant category of persons and it does so in a way which is indiscriminate. The provision imposes a blanket restriction on all convicted prisoners in prison. It applies automatically to such prisoners, irrespective of the length of their sentence and irrespective of the nature or gravity of their offence and their individual circumstances. Such a general, automatic and indiscriminate restriction on a vitally important Convention right must be seen as falling outside any acceptable margin of appreciation, however wide that margin might be, and as being incompatible with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1.”&#xa0;&#xa0;“It does not appear … that anything has occurred or changed at the European and Convention levels since the Hirst (no. 2) judgment that might lend support to the suggestion that the principles set forth in that case should be re-examined. On the contrary, analysis of the relevant international and European documents … and comparative-law information … reveals the opposite trend, if anything – towards fewer restrictions on convicted prisoners’ voting rights.&#xa0;“The Court accordingly reaffirms the principles set out by the Grand Chamber in the Hirst judgment […], in particular the fact that when disenfranchisement affects a group of people generally, automatically and indiscriminately, based solely on the fact that they are serving a prison sentence, irrespective of the length of the sentence and irrespective of the nature or gravity of their offence and their individual circumstances, it is not compatible with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1”.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT RESPONSES TO THE HIRST JUDGMENT]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;“spent three years ensuring that the government took no response to a judgement by the European Court of Human Rights that the UK’s ban on convicted prisoners being able to vote was unlawful. I’d kicked the issue into touch, first with one inconclusive public consultation, then with a second.”&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[EXTRACTS FROM REPORTS OF THE JCHR AND FROM ORAL EVIDENCE TO THE JCHR]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[First Report in 2006]]]:&#xa0;1.40 The Committee also notes that the Government has not taken the opportunity afforded by this Bill to rectify the incompatibility found in October 2005 by the Grand Chamber European Court of Human Rights in Hirst v UK, where it held that the blanket deprivation of voting rights for convicted prisoners breached Article 3 of Protocol 1. The Grand Chamber noted that the ban on voting applied to a wide range of offenders, and did so in a way that was indiscriminate, applying irrespective of length of sentence, gravity of the offence committed, or individual circumstances. Sentencing in the criminal courts made no reference to the disenfranchisement consequent on imprisonment. There had not been any reasoned parliamentary debate on the ban on prisoner voting, which attempted to justify the ban. Although a wide margin of appreciation should be granted to national legislatures in relation to voting rights, this margin of appreciation was not all-embracing. The Court concluded that the general, automatic and indiscriminate nature of the ban meant that it fell outside of the State's margin of appreciation and breached Article 3 of Protocol 1. The Court reserved the question of whether a more targeted ban, applying only to certain categories of offenders, would comply with Article 3 of Protocol 1.&#xa0;1.41 The Secretary of State, in response to our query as to why no steps had been taken in this Bill to rectify the incompatibility found in Hirst, pointed to the complex issues of both legislation and practice raised by the case. In a written statement of 2 February 2006, the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs stated that:&#xa0;The ECtHR indicated that there should be proper debate about those issues and I have therefore concluded that the best way forward would be to embark on full public consultation in which all the options can be examined and which will give everyone the opportunity to have their say. A consultation document is therefore in preparation and I hope it will be available for discussion in a few weeks time. Thereafter there will be a period for those with an interest to make their views known, which will help to inform the development of future policy.&#xa0;1.42 

[[[We regret that Parliament has not been afforded the opportunity to consider the important issue of prisoner voting rights in the course of its scrutiny of the present Bill. We nevertheless welcome the consultation exercise proposed. We look forward to the publication of the consultation document and will return to consider the conclusions of the consultation.]]]&#xa0;

[[[Second Report in 2006]]]&#xa0;51. In October 2005 the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights, giving judgment in Hirst v UK, confirmed the earlier Chamber judgment of the Court that the blanket deprivation of voting rights for convicted prisoners breached Article 3 of Protocol 1. The Grand Chamber noted that the ban on voting applied to a wide range of offenders, and did so in a way that was indiscriminate, applying irrespective of length of sentence, gravity of the offence committed, or individual circumstances. Sentencing in the criminal courts made no reference to the disenfranchisement consequent on imprisonment. There had not been any reasoned parliamentary debate on the ban on prisoner voting, which attempted to justify the ban. Although a wide margin of appreciation should be granted to national legislatures in relation to voting rights, this margin of appreciation was not all-embracing. The Court concluded that the general, automatic and indiscriminate nature of the ban meant that it fell outside of the State's margin of appreciation and breached Article 3 of Protocol 1. The Court reserved the question of whether a more targeted ban, applying only to certain categories of offenders, would comply with Article 3 of Protocol 1.&#xa0;52. We wrote to the DCA to inquire about implementation measures following this case as part of its scrutiny of the Electoral Administration Bill. Subsequently, in a written statement of 2 February 2006, the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs stated that:&#xa0;The ECtHR indicated that there should be proper debate about those issues and I have therefore concluded that the best way forward would be to embark on full public consultation in which all the options can be examined and which will give everyone the opportunity to have their say. A consultation document is therefore in preparation and I hope it will be available for discussion in a few weeks time. Thereafter there will be a period for those with an interest to make their views known, which will help to inform the development of future policy.&#xa0;

[[[53. In our report on the Electoral Administration Bill, we expressed regret that Parliament had not been afforded the opportunity to consider the important issue of prisoner voting rights in the course of its scrutiny of that Bill. We nevertheless welcomed the consultation exercise proposed. We intend to return to consider the proposals for reform of the law arising from the consultation process.]]]&#xa0;

[[[2007]]]&#xa0;77. 

[[[We acknowledge that many people will question why prisoners should be entitled to vote in elections and that the Government would be taking a generally unpopular course if it were to enfranchise even a small proportion of the prison population. Nevertheless, the current blanket ban on the enfranchisement of prisoners is incompatible with the UK's obligations under the European Convention and must be dealt with. ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]78. 

[[[We consider that the time taken to publish the Government's consultation paper and the time proposed for consultation is disproportionate.]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[While the issues involved give rise to political controversy, they are not legally complex.]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[The continued failure to remove the blanket ban, enfranchising at least part of the prison population, is clearly unlawful.]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[It is also a matter for regret that the Government should seek views on retaining the current blanket ban, thereby raising expectations that this could be achieved, when in fact, this is the one option explicitly ruled out by the European Court.]]]&#xa0;79. 

[[[We recommend that the Government bring forward a solution as soon as possible, preferably in the form of an urgent Remedial Order.]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[We strongly recommend that the Government publish a draft Remedial Order as part of its second stage of consultation.]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[We would be disappointed if a legislative solution were not in force in adequate time to allow the necessary preparations to be made for the next general election.]]]&#xa0;

[[[2008]]]&#xa0;47. Since our last Report, we have exchanged correspondence with the Ministry of Justice on the need to implement measures in response to the decision of the Grand Chamber of the ECtHR that the blanket ban on voting by prisoners in the UK is incompatible with the right to participate in free and fair elections, as guaranteed by Article 3, Protocol 1 ECHR. In our last Report, we noted that the Government intended to consider the issue of prisoners' voting rights in a two-stage consultation which was expected to be completed in January 2008. A legislative solution was due to follow, after May 2008. In our last Report we expressed the view that the delay in this case was already disproportionate and recommended that the Government bring forward a solution as soon as possible. &#xa0;.…&#xa0;51. We were surprised to read that the Government was not convinced about the need for legislative reform. The Grand Chamber judgment is clear. Section 3 of the Representation of the People Act is in breach of the Convention and legislative reform is therefore necessary. This view is supported by the declaration of incompatibility subsequently made by the Court of Session. &#xa0;….&#xa0;58. 

[[[The European Court of Human Rights has given clear guidance that individuals' fundamental human rights, including the right to vote, are not contingent on their continuing to be 'good citizens'. Interferences with those rights can only be justified in accordance with the law. When considering whether to limit an individual's right to vote, proportionality requires a clear and close link to the specific conduct of the individual concerned. The Grand ]]]

[[[Chamber implies that this link should include some connection to the stability of the electoral system, the rule of law or the democratic settlement within a state. General breaches of any vague concept of civic duty are, in our view, unlikely to meet the standard of justification envisaged by the ECtHR. ]]]&#xa0;….&#xa0;61. We note that in the three years which have passed since the decision of the Grand Chamber in Hirst, a number of European States have taken steps to address the issue of prisoners' voting rights. In 2006, Ireland passed legislation to enable all prisoners to vote by post in the constituency where they would ordinarily live if they were not in prison. In the same year, Cyprus, which also previously had a blanket ban on voting for prisoners, passed legislation to provide for full enfranchisement of its prison population.&#xa0;62. 

[[[Against this background, the Government's change of approach and failure to set a concrete timetable for its response raises serious questions about its reluctance to deal with this issue. In our previous reports, we have drawn attention to a number of cases where significant delay in implementation has tarnished the otherwise good record of the United Kingdom in responding to the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. For the most part, these cases have been legally straightforward, but politically difficult. This case appears destined to join a list of long standing breaches of individual rights that the current Government, and its predecessors, have been unable or unwilling to address effectively within a reasonable time frame. The Government should rethink its approach.]]]&#xa0;63. 

[[[We call on the Government to publish the responses to its earlier consultation and to publish proposals for reform, including a clear timetable, without further delay. A legislative solution can and should be introduced during the next parliamentary session. If the Government fails to meet this timetable, there is a significant risk that the next general election will take place in a way that fails to comply with the Convention and at least part of the prison population will be unlawfully disenfranchised. ]]]&#xa0;

[[[2009]]]&#xa0;1.10 In our last two reports monitoring adverse human rights judgments, we have criticised the Government's delay in responding to the judgment of the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights in Hirst v UK. In that case, the Grand Chamber decided that the current ban on prisoners' voting in the UK is disproportionate and incompatible with the Convention right to participate in free and fair elections (guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol 1 ECHR). That the relevant statutory provisions have never been subject to a full parliamentary debate played a part in the decision of the court. The statutory ban has also been declared incompatible with Convention rights under Section 4 of the Human Rights Act 1998 by the Court of Session in Scotland.&#xa0;1.11 The decision of the Grand Chamber was handed down in October 2005, after an earlier adverse decision in 2004. The Government launched a consultation on prisoners' voting rights in December 2006. This consultation ended in March 2007 and a second stage consultation was planned. The Government originally aimed to bring forward legislation to address this issue in or around May 2008. Contributions to the first stage of the Government consultation have not been published and the second stage consultation has not been launched.&#xa0;….&#xa0;1.13 Our previous criticisms of the Government's approach to this issue have included:&#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Drawing the attention of both Houses to the continuing failure of the Government to provide answers to our request for information on the timetable proposed for reform and for full information on the Government's approach to the case (including any new information provided to the Council of Europe monitoring body, the Committee of Ministers);-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Expressing concern that the delay in this case indicated that it was destined to join a list of long-standing breaches of the Convention by the United Kingdom which were legally straightforward but politically difficult to remedy;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Noting that, since the judgment was handed down, other countries including Ireland and Cyprus, have amended their elections law to allow prisoners to vote;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Recommending that the Government publish the responses to its earlier consultation and its own proposals for reform without delay, together with a timetable for progress;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Recommending that a legislative solution should be proposed during this parliamentary session. Without such a solution, there is a significant risk that the next general election will take place in a way which unlawfully disenfranchises at least part of the prison population in the United Kingdom.&#xa0;1.14 Contrary to some press reports, we have never suggested that the ECHR requires that all prisoners should be entitled to vote. The current blanket ban on all prisoners voting has been found by the European Court of Human Rights to breach the European Convention and the Government is under an obligation to implement that judgment by repealing the blanket ban and bringing forward an alternative proposal.&#xa0;1.15 We recently asked Jack Straw MP, the Secretary of State for Justice, and Michael Wills MP, the Human Rights Minister, in oral evidence for an explanation of the ongoing delay with this case. The Secretary of State said that lack of parliamentary and political support for reform had contributed to the Government's approach:&#xa0;The difficulty we have got - and there is no secret about this - is this is an issue … on which both the main parties have had a very clear position, which has not been the subject of any significant controversy whatsoever within their parties, that when people are convicted and sentenced to prison they lose their civic right to vote ... If Members of Parliament decide that they are not going to accept what the European Court says then they will not accept it. What we have been seeking to do is to identify the best possible way of meeting the obligations under that decision and to do so in a way that shows respect and achieves consent for that decision, and I happen to think that that is sensible and it recognises the unusual reality of this particular decision.&#xa0;1.16 In addition, the Human Rights Minister added his concern about the practical implications of reform:&#xa0;If prisoners are allowed to vote, there is then the issue of putting them on an equal footing with other voters. Other voters have not a right but an expectation of access to parliamentary candidates so that they can judge them first hand. What implications does that have for prison and prison access at a time when the prison service is already very stretched?&#xa0;1.17 It is surprising that, in the three years during which we have been engaged with the Government on this issue, this is the first time that any Minister has clearly articulated the Government's concerns. While we accept difficult political issues may be involved in meeting the judgment of the Grand Chamber, it remains for the Government to take the initiative and to propose a solution for parliamentarians to scrutinise. In the meantime, UK electoral law remains in breach of the ECHR.&#xa0;1.18 The practical issues which may be associated with reform should not be overemphasised. Prisoners who are on remand, or who have been convicted, but not sentenced, are already entitled to vote and prison rules and guidance exist for this purpose.&#xa0;1.19

[[[It is unacceptable that the Government continues to delay on this issue. The judgment of the Grand Chamber was clear that the blanket ban on prisoners voting in our current electoral law is incompatible with the right to participate in free elections. We call on the Government to explore the possibility of bringing forward amendments to this Bill, to give effect to the European Court's judgment.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[2010]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]99. We have reported on the issue of prisoners voting rights on numerous occasions over the course of this Parliament. In October 2005, the Grand Chamber ruled that the current ban on prisoners' voting in the UK is disproportionate and incompatible with the Convention right to participate in free and fair elections (guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol 1 ECHR).[92] The Grand Chamber were particularly concerned that the relevant statutory provision - Section 3, Representation of the People Act 1983 - has never been subject to a full parliamentary debate. The statutory ban on prisoner voting has subsequently been declared incompatible with Convention rights under Section 4 of the Human Rights Act 1998 by the Court of Session in Scotland.[93]100. We last reported on this case in our report on the Political Parties and Elections Bill, where we revisited our two previous reports on human rights judgments, regretting the delay in the Government's response to this judgment.[94] We concluded:It is unacceptable that the Government continues to delay on this issue. The judgment of the Grand Chamber was clear that the blanket ban on prisoners voting in our current electoral law is incompatible with the right to participate in free elections.[95]&#xa0;101. Since our last report, the High Court has considered a further challenge by a prisoner to the blanket ban on prisoner voting.[96] Three further applications are pending before the European Court of Human Rights.[97]102. The Government published its second stage consultation on the issue of prisoners' voting on 8 April 2009. The Government wrote to the Committee of Ministers in April 2009, summarising the Government's position and introducing the second stage of consultation.[98]103. The Government's consultation puts forward four options, each based on the duration of sentence being served by a prisoner. This would mean all prisoners crossing a specific custodial threshold would automatically be deprived of the right to vote. Only four respondents to the first stage consultation argued in favour of a system of enfranchisement based on duration of sentence.104. In their evidence, Liberty told us they had concerns about the Government's approach to its second stage consultation:It has now been more than four years since the ECtHR ruled that UK law was unlawful yet no changes have yet been made. The first consultation paper rejected outright before receiving any responses the enfranchisement of all prisoners. It only proposed more minor reforms, saying explicitly that full enfranchisement was not an option. This position has been maintained in the second stage consultation which merely proposes allowing prisoners sentenced to between one and four years to continue to hold the right to vote. Liberty believes that all prisoners should retain the right to vote and the Government's failure to implement the ECtHR's decision reflects a lack of political will manifested in a serious of delaying tactics, including a flawed and protracted consultation exercise.[99]&#xa0;105. We wrote to the Minister to ask for further information on the Government's view that the proposals in the second stage consultation were proportionate.[100]&#xa0;We referred to the guidance of the Grand Chamber:[The standard of tolerance required by the Convention] does not prevent a democratic society from taking steps to protect itself against activities intended to destroy the rights or freedoms set forth in the Convention. Article 3 of Protocol 1, which enshrines the individual's capacity to influence the composition of the lawmaking power, does not therefore exclude that restrictions on electoral rights are imposed on an individual who has, for example, seriously abused a public position or whose conduct has threatened to undermine the rule of law or democratic foundations […] The severe measure of disenfranchisement must, however, not be undertaken lightly and the principle of proportionality requires a discernible and sufficient link between the sanction and the conduct and circumstances of the individual concerned.&#xa0;106. The Minister referred us back to the second consultation paper and reiterated:Therefore: "The Government has reached the preliminary conclusion that to meet the terms of the judgment a limited enfranchisement of convicted prisoners in custody must take place, with eligibility determined on the basis of sentence length."&#xa0;Regarding the decision not to enfranchise prisoners sentenced to four years and over, the consultation paper states (pages 25-26) "In line with its view that the more serious the offence that has been committed, the less right an individual should have to retain the right to vote when sentenced to a period of imprisonment, the Government does not intend to permit the enfranchisement of prisoners who are sentenced to 4 years' imprisonment or more in any circumstances. The Government believes that this is compatible with the ECtHR ruling in&#xa0;Hirst (No 2)."[101]&#xa0;107.&#xa0;

[[[We are concerned that, despite the time taken to publish the second consultation, the Government's proposals appear to take a very limited approach to the judgment in]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Hirst]]]

[[[. As we noted earlier in this report, this type of approach can lead to further unnecessary litigation with the associated burden on the European Court of Human Rights and the taxpayer. We accept that the Grand Chamber left a broad discretion to the United Kingdom to determine how to remove the blanket ban. However, the Court stressed that withdrawal of the franchise is a very serious step and gave guidance on the types of offences which might rationally be connected with such a step. We are not persuaded that automatic disenfranchisement based upon a set period of custodial sentence can provide the "discernible link between the conduct and circumstances of the individual" and necessity for the removal of the right to vote required by the Grand Chamber. In our view, this approach will lead to a significant risk of further litigation.]]]108.&#xa0;

[[[Despite our concerns about the narrow nature of the Government's approach, our overriding disappointment is at the lack of progress in this case. We regret that the Government has not yet published the outcome of its second consultation, which closed almost 6 months ago, in September 2009. This appears to show a lack of commitment on the part of the Government to proposing a solution for Parliament to consider.]]]109. In December 2009, the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers issued an interim resolution in respect of the delay in this case. The interim resolution is a significant and serious step and is couched in unambiguous terms. The Committee of Ministers "expresses serious concern that the substantial delay in implementing the judgment has given rise to a significant risk that the next United Kingdom general election…will be performed in a way that fails to comply with the Convention".[102]110. On 15 December 2009, the Minister for Human Rights responded to a written question by Mark Oaten MP, "noting" the interim resolution and again confirming that the Government was considering the outcome of its second consultation on this issue.[103] On the same day, Lord Bach gave a similar response to an oral question by Lord Ramsbottom. He explained that the Government would "respond when we are ready to respond" and that it was the Government's view that the legality of the election would not be affected by the ongoing incompatibility with the ECHR caused by the blanket ban on prisoner voting.[104]111. We wrote to the Human Rights Minister in December 2009 to ask for further information in the light of these developments.[105] Despite the conclusion of the second consultation, the Government told us that it would be some time before it introduces any legislative solution to address the breach identified by the Grand Chamber.[106] We asked the Government whether reform could be achieved by amendment to the Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill, which is currently before Parliament. The Minister for Human Rights told us it would be inappropriate to turn this Bill into a "Christmas tree".[107] Similarly, the Government has rejected using the Remedial Order process to ensure that reform is considered before the general election:We do not think that this is an appropriate issue for a remedial order; it is an appropriate issue for both Houses to decide whether and how this particular ruling of the European Court of Human Rights should be brought into force.[108]&#xa0;112. In February 2010, the Prison Reform Trust and UNLOCK launched a campaign to encourage the Government to remove the blanket ban before the general election. Launching their campaign, they said:The blanket ban remains in place despite the European Court of Human Rights ruling it unlawful in March 2004. In April 2009 the Government acknowledged for the first time that some sentenced prisoners will eventually be allowed to vote but, without urgent action, the general election in 2010 will not be compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights.&#xa0;The Government must now put aside delaying tactics, respect and obey the judgment of the court and overturn the outdated ban on prisoners voting. People in custody should be able to exercise their democratic rights and responsibilities in the forthcoming election.[109]&#xa0;113. The only possible way to introduce a solution before the next election would be as emergency legislation, fast-tracked through the Parliamentary process or through use of the Urgent Remedial Order process provided for in the HRA 1998. Given the lack of opportunity for debate or amendment, neither of these options would provide the degree of opportunity for parliamentary debate which the Court considered desirable and upon which the Government insists.114. In March 2010, the Committee of Ministers confirmed its interim resolution. It reiterated its serious concern that:A failure to implement the Court's judgment before the general election and the increasing number of persons potentially affected by the restriction could result in similar violations affecting a significant category of persons, giving rise to a substantial risk of repetitive applications to the European Court.&#xa0;115. The Committee "strongly urged" the UK Government to rapidly adopt measures "of even an interim nature", in order to ensure the incompatibility is removed before the general election. The Committee decided to review progress at its next meeting in June, which is likely to take place after the election.[110]116.&#xa0;

[[[Hirst v UK]]]

[[[. The Government consultation was finally completed in September 2009. Since then, despite the imminent general election, the Government has not brought forward proposals for consideration by Parliament. We reiterate our view, often repeated, that the delay in this case has been unacceptable.]]]117. The delay in implementing the judgment inevitably leads to the Strasbourg Court being burdened by repetitive applications. Since the decision in&#xa0;Hirst&#xa0;another three applications challenging the blanket ban on prisoners voting have been lodged against the UK in Strasbourg. Another two cases challenging similar bans in Russia and the Czech Republic are pending.[111]&#xa0;We understand that the Government intends to defend the cases against the UK, with the associated costs to the taxpayer. If the Government continues to neglect its duty under Article 46 ECHR to remove the blanket ban on prisoners voting, further cases will arise. We consider that the longer the ban remains in place the greater the incentive will be for existing prisoners - and in particular, if the ban remains in place at the general election, those prisoners denied the right to vote in the election - to bring further applications to the European Court of Human Rights challenging the blanket ban. The Court in Hirst made clear that it was making no judgment on the decision to remove the right to vote in respect of Mr Hirst, but only that the blanket ban was disproportionate. It did not award Mr Hirst any "just satisfaction" or compensation. The Convention is a living instrument and the Court's position on prisoner voting rights will continue to evolve. Where a breach of the Convention is identified, individuals are entitled to an effective remedy by Article 13 ECHR.&#xa0;

[[[So long as the Government continues to delay removal of the blanket ban on prisoner voting, it risks not only political embarrassment at the Council of Europe, but also the potentially significant cost of repeat litigation and any associated compensation.]]]118. In our 2006 report on this case, we regretted the fact that further delay could lead to the general election taking place in a way which would mean that some prisoners were "unlawfully disenfranchised".[112] This conclusion referred to the regrettable circumstance that appears to have come to pass, that a United Kingdom general election would proceed despite the knowledge that it would take place in a way which breached the European Convention on Human Rights. The Government, in its recent correspondence with us and the Committee of Ministers has been keen to emphasise that the ongoing breach of the Convention cannot affect the legality of the forthcoming election. In his recent letter, the Human Rights Minister said:Whilst the Government is bound under Article 46 of the ECHR to implement decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, such decisions do not have the effect of striking down the national law to which they relate. The UK is a dualist legal system in which international law obligations must be translated into domestic law via Parliament. Therefore, whilst the Government accepts that the Court in&#xa0;Hirst v UK (No 2)&#xa0;found that section 3 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 is not compliant with its international law obligations under the Convention, the domestic law continues in force. Similarly, this decision does not have any impact on the continuing validity of our current body of domestic election law.[113]&#xa0;119.&#xa0;

However, without reform the election will happen in a way which will inevitably breach the Convention rights of at least part of the prison population. This is in breach of the Government's international obligation to secure for everyone within its jurisdiction the full enjoyment of those rights. We consider that the Government's determination to draw clear distinctions between domestic legality and the ongoing breach of Convention rights shows a disappointing disregard for our international law obligations.]]]

[[[Q36 ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;

[[[Lord Dubs:]]]&#xa0;I wonder if I could raise the vexed question of prisoners' voting rights. Could I say, and I'm sure I'm not allowed to say it, that as long as there's a coalition Government, I think you two are the good guys, okay? Would you care to comment on the issue of prisoners' voting rights, which I know has raised a wave of hysteria out of all proportion to the issue?

[[[Mr Kenneth Clarke MP]]]: Shall I kick off? The hysteria is rather late coming. The relevant judgment is five years old. To my recollection, the previous Government carried out at least two consultation processes on how they were going to implement it. I have no doubt that because of some of the reaction, in the end they came to no conclusions, so we do have to come to a conclusion on this. We have a mounting number of cases against us and we have to come to some conclusions, otherwise we'll have the absurd situation whereby we're still considering whether or not to comply. We're not there yet, but some court will start awarding damages to all these people making claims against us. If there's one thing that will stoke up public fury even higher, it is if people start getting awarded damages for some breach of their human rights by not being allowed to vote. We're having to consider how to implement the legal obligation and I think there's no point in getting away from the legal obligation. The fact is the extent of the legal obligation is a little confused. We've now got two judgments and various comments both from British and European courts, but two European judgments that aren't really consistent with each other. Compliance with these judgments by different members of the Council of Europe has been very varied. We're by no means the only one that is a long way behind, but we're going to have to come to a conclusion as soon as we can do so. The hysteria was slightly provoked by some rather extreme fears that people had in Parliament. I have to be cautious because the Government has to take a considered view on all this, but people who had the idea that their local government elections were going to be dominated by rapists, murderers and all the rest of it were taking a rather strong view of where we're likely to go. It's the blanket ban on all prisoners having the vote that was not upheld by the European Court. I hesitate on this occasion to go into the nuances of what lies below that—that has yet to be decided. I heard some of the fears expressed in the Chamber of the House of Commons. I didn't think anything was going to occur of the kind that was causing such alarm to quite a lot of my colleagues.

[[[Lord Lester of Herne Hill:]]]&#xa0;I don't know whether you know this, but Cyprus and Ireland, which are not directly bound, overnight implemented it simply by giving postal votes. Hong Kong in its own way did, and for some reason there was no fuss in those jurisdictions at all. Of course the Committee of Ministers will be considering this in a couple of weeks' time, and indeed some of the officials who are on that committee on the enforcement mechanism are sitting behind you. Will you be reporting to them for what's called the DH meeting on your progress?

[[[Mr Kenneth Clarke MP]]]: Yes. I hope we make progress in the next fortnight but I can't guarantee that. I am aware of that. There will be a fuss here. I have not the slightest doubt. On the actual mechanics of voting, I don't see any problem at all. Prisoners on remand can vote now. Not many of them bother to do so, but prisoners on remand do vote by post if they want to. Facilitating the vote is not really the problem. They are usually registered in their home constituency; they are not all registered in the prison where they happen to be currently and involuntarily residing. A remand prisoner just casts a vote if he or she wants in his or her home constituency. I don't think anyone's ever complained about that, probably because people aren't even aware of it. Of course, there is no doubt that they should be allowed to vote, because they haven't been convicted of anything; they are being held pending trial.&#xa0;

[[[2011 Excerpts from Oral Evidence of Professor Jeremy Waldron]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Q57 Lord Lester of Herne Hill: To be precise about it, it was the first protocol to the Convention that introduced what is called the political democracy guarantee, from which the right to vote has been interpreted. As you say, in 1976 when we ratified the ICCPR we built upon that. But is it not right that under our constitutional system, as in New Zealand as well, we have an international obligation binding upon all three branches, including Parliament, to abide by our treaty obligations? Therefore, although we talk about compatible with the law of the land; it is part of our international legal obligations.&#xa0;Professor Waldron: Yes, I agree with that entirely. Part of the point of being a sovereign is that you take on obligations. Both the ICCPR and the European convention are obligations. Certainly, the ICCPR is and always has been quite explicit about the right to vote.&#xa0;Q58 Lord Dubs: I wonder whether I might stay with the prisoners’ right to vote case. I know you have talked quite a lot about it. In your personal view do you think there can be any restrictions on a prisoner’s right to vote in a democracy, or should there be?&#xa0;Professor Waldron: As a personal matter, I think not. This is such a fundamental right, the right of rights, that the grounds for limiting it would have to be very serious indeed; so the issue of proportionality looms very large. I know people differ on these matters, but since we believe that the most fundamental rights should remain with prisoners even during their incarceration, the notion that we can take this one way just because it seems easy to do it is,I think, a serious mistake.&#xa0;Q59 Lord Dubs: Therefore, you think that Parliament should accept the Hirst judgment.&#xa0;Professor Waldron: I think Parliament should accept the content of the Hirst judgment. If it were up to me, this is something that Parliament would arrive at by its own motion.&#xa0;Q60 Lord Dubs: You mentioned that you read with interest the debate in the Commons, although you did say it was a debate about opinion rather than a debate leading to legislation.&#xa0;Professor Waldron: Yes.&#xa0;Q61 Lord Dubs: What do you think the courts should do if Parliament held a full and conscientious debate leading to a legislative position, but decided by a majority to uphold the current ban on the right to vote?&#xa0;Professor Waldron: The current blanket ban on the right to vote?&#xa0;Lord Dubs: Yes.&#xa0;Professor Waldron: Presumably it would do so pursuant to a Section 19 assurance by the Attorney-General that it was compatible, or not? What would you have in mind?&#xa0;Lord Dubs: Presumably, yes.&#xa0;Professor Waldron: The first thing is to imagine what the Strasbourg Court would and should do. I imagine that Court would hold that that was unsatisfactory and rule against us again. The British courts would be bound to take notice of that ruling and might themselves reach the judgment, even independently of Strasbourg, that this was incompatible with the protocol. It seems to me that then you would have a very serious confrontation on this issue. The role of the Court, at the very least in these circumstances, would be to alert the public that this was not a trivial matter but a hugely important one, and not a right to be taken away lightly and have that warning. To move to a system where no such warnings were countenanced within the constitutional system—this is where I am in agreement with Lord Lester—would, I think, be a grave mistake.&#xa0;

[[[Excerpt from the oral evidence of Lord Mackay of Clashfern]]]&#xa0;Q28 Lord Dubs: ---- [W]hat would be the practical impact of the refusal of the United Kingdom to implement the Court’s decision in the Hirst case for the Council of Europe? Lord Mackay of Clashfern: So long as we are members of the Council of Europe, having subscribed to the European Convention on Human Rights, we are in breach of a binding obligation as a state by not observing and giving effect to a final judgment by the Court in a case to which we are parties. That is the practical effect of it. We are in breach of an international obligation. Until now our nation has treated international obligations with some seriousness, for example bringing us into a great war.&#xa0;&#xa0;
