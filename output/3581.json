"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written Evidence from Volunteer Cornwall [CEP0001]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;I will keep this submission very short. Not all Charity Chief Executives are on large salaries. I run a Charity with a turnover of £2,000,000 on a salary of £37,206. The ration between my salary and the lowest paid member of staff in our 40 strong team is \n2.5.\n&#xa0;\nI do the job because I am a values driven person. With qualification including an MBA and experience in business in the UK and overseas I could obtain income in a higher remunerated position but believe my time is better spent making people’s lives b\netter and improving the communities in which they live.\n&#xa0;\nMost large salaries are generally aligned with large national charities not the majority of local charities which delivery services in their communities.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
