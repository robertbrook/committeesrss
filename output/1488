defaulti
defaultnquiry into 
defaultl
defaultocal
default government procurement, given local government’s new public health responsibilities.  B
defaultased on
default our extensive 
defaultexperience of 
defaultthe 
defaultprocurement and provision of publicly funded lifestyle 
defaultweigh
defaultt
default management services for NHS patients, we hope the following points will be helpful to the Committee.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWeight Watchers has concerns over future 
defaultl
defaultocal 
defaultgovernment
default procurement of lifestyle weight management services. Over the last 
defaulteight
default years 
defaultwe 
defaultha
defaultve
default encountered numerous examples of poor procurement practice related to the commissioning of
default publicly funded
default lifestyle weight management services for 
defaultoverweight and obese individuals. 
defaultFor example, many commissioners:
default&#xa0;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDo not understand the reality of weight management. It is a lifelong struggle for the obese, many of whom have a complex range of health, social and economic problems.  This strugg
defaultle is not fully solved through
default 
defaulttime-limited 
defaultintervention
defaults
default.  
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLack knowledge of the scientific literature on the effectiveness of weight management services. They do not understand what the 
defaultscientific 
defaultevidence base indicates in terms of effectiveness. 
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDo not use the evidence base to identify best potential providers
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSet unrealistic weight loss outcomes
default and contract KPIs
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRefuse to engage in pre-tender dialogue, which militates against flexibility and the capability of providers to tailor services to meet the specific needs of target groups.
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBundle services together for individuals with very different weight loss needs
default, for example seeking one provider to deliver a range of services for adults and children
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDo not ask for evidence of d
defaultelivery from providers who over-
defaultpromise
default to secure contracts
default&#xa0;
defaultIn short
default,
default there is a lot wrong with the procurement processes connected to commissioning lifesty
defaultle weight management services. 
default Moving the responsibility for procurement of these services to 
defaultl
defaultocal 
defaultgovernment
default provides an 
defaultexcellent 
defaultopportunity to facilitate the real change required
default to make sure that people get the best possible service which delivers the best possible outcomes in the most cost effective way.  
default&#xa0;
defaultWhilst we have seen many examples of poor practices, there are also examples of high quality, person centred practices; commissioners, groups and working parties who seek to drive up the quality of procurement in lifestyle weight management services. Harnessing the expertise, knowledge and recommendations from these will be important. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultThere is now good evidence that for overweight and obese p
defaulteople, referral to Weight Watchers
default is 
defaultsignificantly 
defaultmore effective and costs the taxpayer less (Jolly et al, 2011; Jebb et al, 2011; Fuller et al, 2012) than 
defaultthe 
defaultusual care that 
defaultprimary care in the NHS is
default able to provide. 
default 
defaultYet few commissioners seem to refer to this evidence and 
defaultprocure 
defaulton this basis. 
default S
defaultervices

default 
defaultprovided by NHS based health professionals 
defaultoften remain the preferred 
defaultand more costly 
defaultoption.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultAround 60% of adults are overweight and obese.  
defaultThey need support to lose
default weight to prevent the massive burden of obesity linked conditions such as 
defaulttype 2 
defaultdiabetes and cardiovascular disease.  Providing lifestyle weight management services for these people makes good economic sense and to date, Primary Care Trusts have 
defaultworked to mak
defaulte a range of services available for those with unhealthy weights.  However, there has been massive variation in the service
defaults
default patients can access through primary care, and the reality has been a 
defaultpostcode lottery.  The responsibility for public health and the procurement of lifestyle weight management services has now moved to local government.  These services will be funded through the £2.7 billion public health budget devolved (and theoretically ring-fenced) to local government.  However, anecdotal evidence from Weight Watchers’ public health contacts, who have moved from the NHS 
defaultin
defaultto local government, suggests that there has been a loss of skills, knowledge, experience and expertise in 
defaultweight management
default service
defaults
default commissioning – and specifically lifestyle behavioural change interventions.  It remains unclear who will commission these vital services
default, at present it seems that local government are rationalising their procurement professionals; losing highly skilled public health commissioners in favour for more generic profiles that handle a wide portfolio.  
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultT
defaulthere is a 
defaultvery real danger that the procurement of lifestyle weight management services 
defaultwill fall through the gap between local government and Clinical Commissioning Groups
default (CCGs)
default.
default These services, that support people who are already overweight or obese, should be a fundamental part of a comprehensive healthy weight approach in local areas, one that spans prevention and clinical treatment. Early indications from our national view are that local government will largely focus on prevention measures and the NHS will only focus on complex and morbid obesity services that provide weight loss surgery. Behavioural change interventions for individuals, that support people to learn how to change their lifestyles, eating and activity to manage their weight, are at risk of being completely lost in this new procurement landscape. 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultWeight Watchers is an example of an evidence
default-
defaultbased programme which helps peop
defaultle lose weight and keep it off.  
defaultYet most of the clinical and public health guidance linked to behavioural change weight control interventions seem
defaults
default to encourage commissioners to 
defaultdesign, produce, pilot
default and
default refine
default new interventions rather than using 
defaultthose that are already 
defaulttried and tested.

default&#xa0;
defaultIn the absence of a national strategy on procurement of 
defaultlifestyle weight management
default services, the organisations responsible for 
defaultl
defaultocal 
defaultgovernment
default procurement should work collaboratively with providers to facilitate 
defaultthe 
defaultreal change required to shape 
defaultl
defaultocal 
defaultgovernment 
defaultprocurement going forward. Local 
defaultgovernment 
defaultprocurement in the future needs to be mutually ben
defaulteficial to all parties involved:

defaultocal 
defaultgovernment
default with regard to 
defaultvalue for money and 
defaultmeeting savings targets
default,
default and 
defaultto 
defaultsuppliers in their ability to do more worthwhile business
default. P
defaultresently there is no evidence of such collaboration over 
defaultweight management
default services
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultDespite NICE guidance recommending that ‘healthcare agencies should recommend to patients, or consider endorsing, self-help, commercial and community weight management programmes if they follow best practice
default’
default,  over the last 
defaulteight
default years Weight Watchers has fought for acceptance as an effective referral route for overweight and obese NHS patients.
default 
default   
default&#xa0;
defaultThe previous Government’s obesity strategy, ‘Healthy Weight: Healthy Lives’, promoted partnerships as an essential element to solve the “obesity epidemic”.  Yet this rhetoric seldom became a reality.  In addition there was limited recognition of providers such as Weight Watchers within local obesity strategies or within local obesity care pathways drawn up by PCTs.  Historically Weight Watchers has encountered commercial prejudices (i.e. not being perceived as offering as high a quality service as NHS providers) within NHS commissioning circles where protectionism of public sector providers is often rife.
default 
default It is hoped that now 
defaultl
defaultocal 
defaultgovernment is 
defaultresponsible for procurement of these services, there will be a sea change in attitudes to providers who have good quality data underpinning the effectiveness of the services they offer and who meet NICE best practice standards. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWeight Watchers applauds the overall emphasis in the Health and Social Care Bill that it will be outcomes that matter, not targets or activity alone, with government pledging an end to the production line approach to delivering services.  As such, providers will be paid according to their performance.  However, this principle needs careful application to weight management services.  Helping people lose weight is complex, often requiring behavioural intervention, backed up by regular and lifelong support and review.  Losing weight requires great effort and patients often describe the weight loss journey as ‘an endless battle’ (DH 2010).  Research suggests that high relapse and dropout rates are common in weight loss treatment studies – ranging from 10 – 80% (Inelman et al, 2005). For example, in the Counterweight study where weight management interventions were mediated by practice nurses (2004) retention was 22.5% at 12 months.  There is a danger that if payment by results is insensitively applied to weight management service providers, then only 
defaultpeople 
defaultwith lower BMIs (25 – 30 kg/m²) and less complex health and socioeconomic needs will be accepted 
defaultas eligible by commissioners 
defaultand this will cause inequalities of access
default. 
default 
defaultInsensitive p
defaultayment by results 
defaultKPIs 
defaultin 
defaultthe weight management arena could
default discriminate against larger p
defaulteople
default with complex health problems. The solution is to set realistic 
defaultKPIs 
defaultspecific to different types of 
defaultweight management interventions, informed by the evidence-base of what’s healthy and what’s possible 
default(e.g. drug treatments, group support, one to one with a practice
default nurse, very low calorie diets). 
defaultThese very specific
default KPIs should be grounded 
defaultin what the research indicates is achievable and should form the basis for any ‘payment by results’ scheme. It is unfortunate but discussions that we have had with commissioners so far regarding this issue have indicated that their desired results are certainly not based on the evidence of what is achievable for a specific intervention, 
defaultoften seeming being ‘
defaultplucked out of the air
default’
default.

default&#xa0;
defaultOver the last decade Weight Watchers has made significant investment in research to evaluate the efficacy of its methods, and the effectiveness of its Referral Scheme.  
defaultA recently completed randomised controlled trial (Jebb et al 201
default1
default) conducted across 3 countries (England, Germany and Australia) revealed that patients referred to Weight Watchers lost significantly more weight (-4.02kg) at one year compared to those who received standard care within primary care (-1.59kg). Of those who completed, patients referred to Weight Watchers lost significantly more weight (-6.87kg) at one year compared to those who received standard care within primary care (-3.17kg). 61% of Weight Watchers patients vs. 32% of standard care patients lost ≥ 5% baseline weight. Dropout rates were also higher in the primary care group (50%) compared to the Weight Watchers group (41%). This 
defaultindependent research shows that when healthcare agencies and the 
defaultindependent 
defaultsector work in collaboration, changes
default in health behaviours
default that result in weight loss outcomes can be significant.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 2009 Weight Watchers commissioned the independent Foresight team to project the economic consequences of larger scale referral to Weight Watchers.  The authors calculated that if just 4% of the adult population (bearing in mind that currently 60% are overweight or obese, this is an extremely conservative analysis) were referred for a 12 session course of Weight Watchers and this resulted in an average BMI drop of 1.5 u
defaultnits (which is what is generally
default achieved if people complete the course), then this, if maintained over their lifetime, would result in direct healthcare cost savings of  £1,860 per person, and society saving £9 billion up to 2080 (Brown and McPherson, 2009).
default&#xa0;
defaultTo support weight maintenance, once any Weight Watchers member reaches a healthy weight, they can attend Weight Watchers meetings free of charge for the rest of their lives. If the member came to Weight Watchers via 
defaulta local government, public health procured scheme 
defaultthey would be entitled to the same lifetime support – at zero cost to the public purse.
