[[[About ]]]

[[[whg]]]whg is one of the largest social housing providers in the West Midlands. It owns and manages around 19,000 properties in the Metropolitan Borough of Walsall, housing almost 40,000 people, around one fifth of the borough’s population. whg was founded in 2003 with the transfer of Walsall Council’s housing stock and has since invested over £350 million in that stock.  It has developed a range of services that go beyond the landlord’s traditional contractual role and support customers to sustain their tenancies.

[[[Reason for submission]]]Whg is a large landlord and has conducted research into the impact of the reforms and expects some challenges for itself and its customers. It believes that its findings, experience and development of best practice will help to inform the inquiry into the effects of welfare reform and how housing providers can mitigate them.    &#xa0;

[[[its customers]]]whg has assessed the potential impacts of the social sector size criteria, the overall benefit cap and the direct payment of Universal Credit. These reform measures were chosen because of the direct nature of their impact on housing providers and customers. &#xa0;4.1 Size Criteria &#xa0;whg predicted that the social sector size criteria would affect 2,800 customers under-occupying according to the Department for Work and Pensions occupancy rules. This would create a shortfall between rent due and benefit paid of some £1.9 million pounds per annum. It is still relatively early in the process of assessing the actual impact, but whg’s records at the end of August suggest an increase in rent arrears in excess of £750,000 in this financial year, of which just under £400,000 can be directly attributed to the size criteria.  The shortfall of Housing Benefit represents the amount of total rentnot being eligible for payment of Housing Benefit and which must bepaid by whg customers from elsewhere within their benefit income or othermeans. Initial research showed that 1 bedroom under-occupiers had average rents of £86.30 per week and when a 14% deduction was applied, there was a £12.05 shortfall. Where 2 or more bedrooms were under-occupied incurring a 25% deduction, the average weekly rent was £84.82 with a £21.21 shortfall. &#xa0;&#xa0;4.2 Direct payments to Universal Credit claimants

[[[&#xa0;]]]Housing Benefit has not been paid directly to the vast majority of benefit claimants in recent years, so it has been difficult to obtain consistent and reliable evidence on the likely magnitude of potential loss of rent revenue from switching to payment to claimants when Universal Credit is rolled out. While the direct payment demonstration projects were set up to provide such guidance, it has become apparent that there are many variations by location, the nature of the stock and demographics. The guarded culture around the projects has not assisted landlords to obtain a feel for the magnitude of direct payments’ likely impact. &#xa0;Gathering meaningful information has been further complicated by changes to the Universal Credit roll out programme. If the roll out timescale, geographical spread and complexity of the claims allowed is not known, providers cannot model the rate at which the effects of direct payment will be felt without a large margin of error. Whg has therefore erred on the side of prudence by substantially increasing its bad debt provision.&#xa0;&#xa0;4.3 Overall Benefit Cap&#xa0;The benefit cap may lead to a loss of rent income where families have to adjust to reduced budgets. Capped households are being asked to prioritise their spending from a shrinking budget and therefore housing providers are in competition with other demands on the household purse. Advice agencies often express the idea that customers should prioritise the roof over their heads, but the fact that excess awards are sliced off benefit to pay for housing sends a subliminal message to tenants that housing is their least priority. This will inevitably lead to rent payments being missed, arrears being built up and tenancies at risk of not being sustained.

[[[ Mitigation against the impacts of reform]]]As a result of the impacts to the organisation and its customers, whg developed a comprehensive action plan to mitigate the major effects of the reform measures with the aims of mitigating the impacts on its customers and maximising its ability to continue to provide excellent housing and related services. Some initiatives from the plan are set out below.5.1 Customer Services Training and ScriptingThe impact of the reforms across whg’s customer base meant that as many colleagues as possible needed to be given relevant training about the reforms so that a triage service was viable. Training enabled whg colleagues to help as many customers as possible with queries at the first point of contact, whilst more complex issues were referred to specialist colleagues. In addition, scripts were developed and available for anyone in the business to access via the internal computer network to use to guide responses to incoming queries. 5.2 Communications StrategyThe broad impact also governed whg’s communications strategy. With a large number of affected customers, a variety of methods of contact was adopted for our diverse customer base. Methods adopted included personal contact, mail shot, customer leaflets, website information, social media such as Twitter and Facebook as well as engaging customers to talk about welfare reform issues in the course of everyday business.5.3 Financial Inclusion ReviewFinancial inclusion provision was reviewed and the decision was taken to recruit three money mentors to supplement the Welfare Benefit and Debt Advice function and provide a triage service to customers likely to be affected by under-occupation deductions and the benefit cap. It is expected that this work will continue for Universal Credit claimants who may be vulnerable and need help to cope with direct benefit payment to them.5.4 Direct Debit as Preferred method of PaymentThe replacement of landlord direct payment with direct payment to claimants of Universal Credit will mean that customers will have a responsibility to pay rent where the fact that they pay rent may not necessarily be apparent to them under the current Housing Benefit system. The consequence will be that at least some proportion of rent payments will not be made because of the switch. To minimise loss of rent income from direct payment, whg adopted direct debit as its preferred method of payment. All new tenants since September 2012 have been required to set up direct debits or find a suitable proxy method such as via a budgeting or jam jar account. Extensive work has been done to incorporate affordability and money management training into the pre-tenancy customer experience. This training is also available to those customers who approach whg to give notice on their tenancy because they are experiencing affordability issues.The additional goal was set to get all existing customers to go on to direct debit. To support this, a choice of only two direct debit payment days per month has been replaced with ‘any day’ direct debit so that customers can synchronise their rent payment with the date that they receive benefit payments. Our latest figures from August 2013 show that direct debit take up is increasing at roughly 400 customers on average each month.5.5 Budgeting or Jam Jar AccountsIf a customer does not have a bank account or is unsuitably banked, whg signposts its customers to the local Walsave credit union. Walsave offers a budgeting account which has the facility to mimic a direct debit payment. To encourage take up, whg pays the first year’s set up and administration costs of £23, which means that customers do not have to pay transaction charges in the first year. A personal spending pot is set up and whg adds ten pounds to it on setting up the account with the ability to add another five pounds if the customer maintains a clear rent account for six months. To make it as easy as possible for customers to sign up for a budgeting account, a whg colleague has been seconded to Walsave to be available in the main whg reception area so that immediate help is available if customers decide that a jam jar account is beneficial to them. The requirement for customers to pay by direct debit or ‘jam jar’ account attempts to mitigate the effects of customers no longer paying by benefit direct. whg believes that housing should be considered as an essential household expenditure along with council tax, utilities and food. In an ideal world, it would prefer payment under Universal Credit to be made direct from benefit.  In the medium to long term, this would result in lower public sector costs as there would be less homelessness and finance-related household stress.)5.6 Wincred (Walsall in Credit)As planning for reform proceeded, whg was wholly aware that it could not do all of the work necessary to mitigate reform on its own. Partnership working was therefore of vital importance. In Walsall, financial inclusion work is co-ordinated through the Wincred partnership, an umbrella organisation for all partners with an interest in the financial wellbeing of Walsall residents. Members include various department of the local authority, Walsave, Citizens Advice Bureau and various advice and third sector bodies. The partners have undertaken campaigns such as one warning vulnerable tenants against the threat of loan sharks and doorstep lenders.  5.7 I.T.’s Your LifePartnership between whg and Walsall Adult and Community College (WACC) brought a new digital inclusion initiative into being. A small sample survey early in the process of welfare reform planning showed that only 58% or residents had suitable home-based internet access for the purpose of claiming Universal Credit in line with the government’s stated wish for people to claim online. The “I.T.’s Your Life” programme was born from the partnership with WACC. The programme uses public facilities such as public libraries to run short courses which enable people to get access to computers, develop skills to use online services and to set up an email address. Crucially, those finishing the course are enabled to make and manage benefit claims digitally.5.8 Independent Living Team workshops for external organisationsAside from formal partnerships, whg’s Independent Living Team organised a series of free workshops at which partner organisations, stakeholders, NHS and other health and social services were given a presentation to engage them and make them more aware of welfare reform issues. This knowledge informed their subsequent interactions with the more vulnerable customers affected by the changes. The series of eight workshops was over-subscribed and feedback rated the sessions as excellent. The sessions were replicated regionally at the request of the West Midlands Best Use of Stock partnership.

[[[Conclusion]]]whg’s approach to welfare reform recognises that the organisation and our customers will face difficult times as the welfare reforms come into effect and beyond. Plans were developed to include as many mitigating interventions as possible to help sustain tenancies and to maintain services. The mitigations have been positively received in Walsall and it is hoped that they will help to inform the debate on how tenants, especially vulnerable ones, can be helped nationallyWhilst we cautiously look forward to the introduction of Universal Credit the issue of direct payment of the housing element of Universal credit is one that should be reviewed. The greater benefit of household stability far outweighs the desire to replicate the household budget of working households.&#xa0;27 September 2013&#xa0;
