"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Philip Foster (CLC005)&#xa0;\nThe question that the subject of your enquiry boils down to is this.\n&#xa0;\n\"Why is it that 'ordinary' people are increasingly doubting the carefully constructed and well orchestrated panoply of lies we have been telling them?\"&#xa0;\nThe Answer:\n&#xa0;\nIn many cases we just might know more science than you do, and secondly not be quite as\n \ngullible as many of you seem to be.\n&#xa0;\nThe 'science', as you people are so keen on assuring us, is 'settled'. Indeed it is settled \nâ€“\n in\n \nfavour of the null hypothesis. There is no dangerous 'climate change' caused by human\n \nactivity, increasing C02 does not present a threat, rather a benefit - more crops and therefore\n \nmore food to feed a growing population.\n&#xa0;\nThe economics of 'green' energy are the economics of the madhouse.\n&#xa0;\nThe old adage 'the truth is an oft repeated lie' for once has proved as untrue as the\n \ngovernment paid climate scientists' predictions. They would be wise to heed these words in\n \nthe \nTorah:\n&#xa0;\nYou may say to yourselves, \"How can we know when a message has not been spoken by the\n \nLORD?\" If what a prophet proclaims in the name of\n \nthe LORD does not take place or come\n \ntrue, that is a message the LORD has not spoken. That prophet has spoken presumptuously.\n \nDo not be afraid of\n \nhim.\n&#xa0;\nDeuteronomy 18:21-22\n&#xa0;\nApril 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
