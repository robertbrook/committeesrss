[normal] Supplementary written evidence from [bold]Rt[bold] Hon Chris Grayling MP, Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, Ministry of Justice, [bold]following [bold]the [bold]evidence [bold]session on [bold]16[bold] [bold]October[bold] 2013[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Protocol 36 process[bold]While giving evidence to 
[normal]the Justice
[normal] Committee on 16 October 2013, I committed to providing you 
[normal]with some additional information relating to Council Framework Decision 2008/947/JHA on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments and probation decisions 
[normal]with a view to the supervision of probation measures and alternative sanctions (the 
[normal]Probation FD). For ease of reference, this measure is number 88 on the list of measures 
[normal]within the scope of the 2014 decision that we placed in the House library and further 
[normal]information on it can be found in Command Paper 8671.
[normal]As I explained while giving evidence, one of the key issues the Government had in mind 
[normal]when considering which measures to rejoin
[normal] 
[normal]was that those measures will permanently come 
[normal]under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) once we rejoin them. As you 
[normal]know, many of the pre-Lisbon measures were political compromises in order to secure unanimity and as a result can be broadly drafted. If the UK Parliament enacted similarly 
[normal]broad legislation UK courts would have to interpret that legislation were it ambiguous or 
[normal]unclear. Of course in the case of 
[normal]EU [bold]legislation, it would ultimately be the ECJ which would 
[normal]decide how a measure should be interpreted. The key issue is what happens if the 
[normal]interpretation of that legislation by the ECJ results in unwelcome outcomes for the UK which 
[normal]the Government wants to address. If it was a UK law and a UK court then the UK Parliament 
[normal]could respond. However, with an EU law and an ECJ judgment the - UK cannot act 
[normal]unilaterally to amend the law.
[normal]With this in mind, the Government assessed each measure and considered whether on 
[normal]balance the UK should seek to rejoin it. In the case of the Probation FD, it has only been implemented by a limited number of Member States and we are not aware of it ever having 
[normal]been used to date. As such, at this stage it is very difficult to make an assessment as to how 
[normal]the measure might or might not work.
[normal]When I made this point while giving evidence I touched upon the measure's vagueness in
[normal] 
[normal]relation to deportation and committed to provide you with further detail on that point in
[normal] 
[normal]particular. Article 5 of the measure relates to the criteria for forwarding on a judgment and,
[normal] 
[normal]where applicable, a probation decision. In our view it is entirely unclear in relation to its
[normal] a
[normal]pplication to persons who have been returned to another Member State as a consequence 
[normal]of being deported and who did not consent to 
[normal]be 
[normal]returned but who are now lawfully and 
[normal]ordinarily residing there. My view is that the better reading of this FD is that this does not 
[normal]apply to deportees, as the provision implies that return should be a choice, but it is 
[normal]absolutely not clear whether other Member States, the Commission and ultimately the ECJ 
[normal]would agree.
[normal]Whether or not it applies to deportees and in what circumstances could of course have potentially substantial consequences in terms of the Probation FD's usefulness, and impact 
[normal]on the UK. If it doesn't apply to deportees then its usefulness (as a public protection 
[normal]measure allowing states to supervise incoming deportees who may present a risk) is 
[normal]obviously significantly curtailed. If it does apply to deportees then, although this may affect a 
[normal]relatively small group of offenders, we are unclear as to what happens in the event an 
[normal]individual is deported, the probation decision or alternative sanction is transferred, and 
[normal]there is a subsequent breach. In particular, Member States may make a declaration that they will 
[normal]not deal with breach locally, under certain circumstances, but will transfer jurisdiction back to the issuing Member State (and we already know from declarations made by some Member 
[normal]States that some States will do this). As a result, if the person has already been deported, 
[normal]and the receiving Member. State then wishes to return jurisdiction on breach, I am not clear what the status of that deportation would be. Alternatively, the transferred order may be 
[normal]unenforceable, thereby entirely undermining the purpose of the FD. These are very 
[normal]important questions and until we have clearer answers it is not a measure that I consider the 
[normal]UK should seek to rejoin.
