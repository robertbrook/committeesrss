[normal]sector teams and international networks identify overseas opportunities for the 
[normal]UK supply chain.  
[normal]They share information 
[normal]with industry
[normal], assess

[normal]1.4
[normal]              
[normal]DECC seeks to ensure the UK has secure, clean and affordable energy supplies. To that end, DECC works with the oil and gas industry to maximise the UK's oil and gas resource and is working with industry to realise its economic potential.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5
[normal]              
[normal]DECC respon
[normal]sibilities include the issuing of licences for oil and gas exploration and production, regulating field development and offshore oil and gas pipeline activities as well as regulating the environmental aspects of the offshore oil and gas 
[normal]industry, including
[normal] decommissioning.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]DECC

[normal]2.[bold]              [bold]Q[bold]1 &amp; 2.  [bold]Economic Contribution[bold] including employment[bold]2.1
[normal]              
[normal]The extractive industries, and the petroleum sector in 
[normal]particular, generate significant economic rent—the difference between the value and cost of production. Extractive industry revenues tend to be volatile, uncertain and exhaustible.
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]Information on the economic contribution of UK
[normal] coal, oil and gas production – including in terms of direct contribution to GDP, direct employment and investment – is included in 
[normal]UK Energy in Brief
[normal].
[normal] That contribution is summarised in the following table:
[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]The table at 
[normal]Annex [bold]1[bold] [bold]gives a feel for the importance of fossil fuels to meeting UK energy demand and of UK production of those fuels.
[normal]2.4
[normal]              
[normal]Comprehensive information on the UK
[normal] oil and gas industry including the UK supply chain is provided in the annual 
[normal]Economic Report
[normal] of Oil &amp; Gas 
[normal]UK
[normal].  
[normal]Including the 36,000 people it estimates to have been directly employed in hydrocarbon 
[normal]exploration and production in 2012, Oil &amp; Gas UK estimat
[normal]e that the UK upstream oil and gas 
[normal]industry supported some 450,000 jobs
[normal].  There are 
[normal]many highly skilled
[normal] jobs
[normal], across the whole economy, with 200,000 employed in the supply chain, 112,000 in jobs induced by the economic activity of the above employees and 1
[normal]00,000 in the export of goods and services.
[normal]2.5
[normal]              
[normal]Up-to date coal statistics are published by the Coal Authority
[normal] 
[normal]a
[normal]nd by UK Coal
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]UK Coal’s Daw Mill deep mine closed in March 2013
[normal] f
[normal]ollowing a devastating fire. That leaves the UK
[normal] with just three large operational deep mines – Hatfield
[normal], 
[normal]Kellingley and Thoresby collieries. 
[normal]2.6
[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]he greatest part of UK coal demand comes from electricity generation. Power stations have represented more than 80% of total UK coal consumption each year s
[normal]ince 2001 and 86% in 2012. Over th
[normal]is
[normal] period coal has provided on average around a third of total UK electricity with gas’s share averaging 40% (and approaching a half in 2008–2010) but those shares were roughly reversed in 2012.

[normal]: 
[normal]3. [bold]Wider benefits to [bold]UK[bold] industry[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]As set out in 
[normal]UK – Delivering Global Mining Solutions
[normal] 
[normal]capability publication, the
[normal] UK's mining equipment designers and manufacturers deliver world-leading 
[normal]products across the entire mining lifecycle.  The UK has world
[normal]-
[normal]leading educational providers and cutting edge R&amp;D facilities which deliver training as well 
[normal]as research which is utilised across the world. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]A UK firm can provide equipment with many of the components manufactured in the UK including planning, construction, operation and closure.  London is also a centre of excellence in the provision of bus
[normal]iness and professional services in support of the sector.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]              
[normal]These UK-based services supporting the extractive industries have often developed in response to mining companies listed in London and/or have located in London to be close to their client’s
[normal] Head Quarters
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]              
[normal]More specifically, locally sourced extractive
[normal]s 
[normal]are important 
[normal]to 
[normal]other sectors
[normal] in the UK
[normal].  
[normal]A good example is i
[normal]ndigenous limestone 
[normal]which is 
[normal]used in the manufacture of cement, mortar and concrete.  
[normal]L
[normal]imestone 
[normal]is
[normal] vital for security of supply and cost competitiveness in construction projects.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4[bold].[bold]              [bold]UK Extractive Industries Competitive Position[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]The Oil &amp; Gas Industrial Strategy 
[normal]highlighted 
[normal]that 
[normal]the 
[normal]oil and gas sector generates £27bn for the economy. 
[normal]The strategy 
[normal]also shows that
[normal] th
[normal]e UK is the largest producer of oil in Europe
[normal] and that f
[normal]orecasts show that there will be record investment in 2013 of £14b
[normal]n
[normal] to search for and produce UK oil and gas reserves.  
[normal]4.2
[normal]              
[normal]UK firms are involved across the mining supply chain from
[normal] the provision of components to manufacture of completed items of equipment which are exported across the globe.  With limited domestic opportunities, UK mining equipment companies have had to develop innovative products and technologies to compete interna
[normal]tionally.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]              
[normal]The UK 
[normal]has 
[normal]world class engineering design companies active in the extractives sector and involved in mine design, construction, 
[normal]and 
[normal]associated services 
[normal]such as power, water and infrastructure.  UK
[normal] consultancies advise on all aspects of the mine design and operation including environmental impact assessments and master planning.   As well as the global financial centre for the industry
[normal],
[normal] London is also a centre of excellence in the provision of busin
[normal]ess and professional services which support the sector.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5[bold].[bold]              [bold]Corporate Governance [bold]and reputation[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal].1
[normal]              
[normal] 
[normal]London is one of the world
[normal]’
[normal]s leading financial centres and attracts a wide range of companies to list on its markets.  
[normal]As well as having 
[normal]significant expe
[normal]rtise in mining and extractives, a 
[normal]key strength of the UK and its financial institutions is
[normal] its 
[normal]strong corporate governance framework,
[normal] 
[normal]which is robust by comparison to many countries in which extractives may operate.  A listing on the London Stock Exchange
[normal] is evidence that a company is held to a high standard which promotes confidence when dealing with that company. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]              
[normal]The extractive industry has a unique risk profile as a result of the varied projects that the average extractive 
[normal]company 
[normal]carries out. 
[normal]The
[normal]s
[normal]e projects are 
[normal]often in countries carrying greater risks
[normal] which 
[normal]require permits and licen
[normal]c
[normal]es. 
[normal] Th
[normal]ere are particular r
[normal]isks 
[normal]which 
[normal]extractive companies 
[normal]could be 
[normal]particularly exposed
[normal] to
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]hese 
[normal]might 
[normal]be
[normal] reputational, operational
[normal], environmental
[normal] 
[normal]as well as
[normal] bribery and corruption risk
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The UK’s existing regu
[normal]latory regime helps to mitigate
[normal] these risks.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]Extractive companies 
[normal]have a responsibility to ensure that their corporate governance is compliant with the regulatory regime. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3
[normal]              
[normal]In itself, the number of
[normal] extractives listing in the UK should not pose any concerns if they are compliant with the regulatory regime.   However, 
[normal]there are a num
[normal]ber of events that would raise
[normal] concern
[normal]s
[normal] that the regulatory regime is being improperly applied.  This includes, but is n
[normal]ot limited to:
[normal]i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]a 
[normal]significant 
[normal]number of companies displaying corporate governance failures;
[normal]ii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]inadequate
[normal] 
[normal]monitoring or 
[normal]enforcement of failures 
[normal]of cor
[normal]porate governance on an industrial
[normal] scale
[normal];
[normal]iii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]corporate governance failures affecting the market value of extracti
[normal]ves across the industry as a whole and
[normal];
[normal]iv)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]a significant
[normal] number of companies listing in London
[normal] 
[normal]that pose a significantly higher risk
[normal] profile 
[normal]than the average FTSE listing.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4
[normal]              
[normal]Without mitigating these risks, 
[normal]investors 
[normal]could 
[normal]question the 
[normal]effectiveness of the 
[normal]UK
[normal] regulatory framework as whole
[normal], with inherent reputational risks to the UK and its financial institutions. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.5
[normal]              
[normal]At present, there are concerns that the interests of minority shareholders are under-represented in companies where ther
[normal]e are powerful majority shareholders and in companies which are traded publicly but have a relatively small proportion of shares in public circulation. In both these situation
[normal]s there is a concern about
[normal] the increased concentrations of shareholder power in t
[normal]he hands of the few
[normal]. This means
[normal] it is less likely that minority shareholders will be able to make their views known and hold directors to account in the event of corporate governance failures. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal].
[normal]6
[normal]              
[normal]These issues have been considered by the UK Listing Autho
[normal]rity.  The FCA consulted last October
[normal] on proposals to enhance the effectiveness of the Listing Regime overall and in particular to provide greater protection to shareholders in situations where there is a controlling shareholder.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] FCA intend
[normal]s 
[normal]to provide f
[normal]eedback on this consultation in October.

[normal]6[bold].[bold]              [bold]E[bold]ngagement between U[bold]K [bold]extractive industries and the NGO[bold]s[bold] [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]6
[normal].1
[normal]              
[normal]The UK Government 
[normal]is
[normal] committed to working with 
[normal]stakeholders 
[normal]including industry and NGOs 
[normal]when developing
[normal] and delivering
[normal] policy.  
[normal]T
[normal]he Accounting 
[normal]Directive
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]EITI
[normal] 
[normal]provide
[normal] good examples of 
[normal]the Government
[normal] 
[normal]working with both 
[normal]NGOs and Industry on transparency
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]6
[normal].2
[normal]              
[normal]At the international level, the Board of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) brings together civil society organisations and companies and investors on a regular basis to agree the EITI rules by consensus.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Several UK-listed extractive
[normal] companies are on the EITI Board. In each of the 39 countries which implement the EITI, there is a multi-stakeholder group of 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment, companies and civil society which together oversee the EITI process.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]6
[normal].3
[normal]              
[normal]As part of the UK implementation of the EIT
[normal]I, BIS is establishing a multi
[normal]-
[normal]stakeholder group which will also allow UK extractive companies and NGOs to work together to oversee reporting of payments to the UK 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment for extractives
[normal].
[normal]6
[normal].4
[normal]              
[normal]BIS 
[normal]brought NGOs and industry together to work on extractive
[normal]s transparency
[normal] during the 
[normal]negotiations and implementation of the Accounting Direc
[normal]tive
[normal].  
[normal]The 
[normal]most recent meeting
[normal] included
[normal] industry representatives from Shell, BP, BG Group, Rio Tinto and Anglo American
[normal], who 
[normal]attended alongside NGO representatives from Publish What You Pay, CAFOD, Tearfund, Christian Aid, Global Witness and ONE. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6
[normal].5
[normal]              
[normal]These
[normal] meeting
[normal]s
[normal] helped to build understanding between the two groups around the reasons 
[normal]why 
[normal]they had each adopted their respecti
[normal]ve positions
[normal].  
[normal]These meetings 
[normal]allowed them to begin to identify areas where a compromise could satisfy both parties. 
[normal] BIS
[normal] will continue to hold all
[normal]-
[normal]group meetings at regular intervals during the implementation phase. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]7[bold].[bold]              [bold]Extractive Sector and skills [bold]7
[normal].1
[normal]              
[normal]The extractive industries cover a wide group of sub-sectors from mining and quarrying to the oil and gas extraction industries all with similar, but different
[normal],
[normal] skills challenges. 
[normal]7
[normal].
[normal]2
[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]he Oil and Gas sector Industrial Strategy identified how the sector 
[normal]and the Government can work on the skills challenges 
[normal]faced by the 
[normal]sector
[normal].  L
[normal]inks could be made with opportunities in future sectors including shale gas. 
[normal]7
[normal].
[normal] 3
[normal]              
[normal]The strategy acknowledges that high levels of activity and global competition have resulted in 
[normal]skills shortages in the sector
[normal].  The 
[normal]lack of availability of skilled workers is one of the biggest challenges the sector faces. 
[normal] 
[normal]The strategy s
[normal]uggests key actions to be taken forward by Government and Industry such as a 
[normal]skills gap analysis
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]initiatives to 
[normal]recruit ex-military personnel
[normal] and 
[normal]the redeployment of those from other 
[normal]linked industries to 
[normal]the
[normal] sector.  These will build on the number of existing initiatives being taken forward by
[normal] the Offshore Petroleum Industry Training Organisation
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]OPITO
[normal])
[normal] and others
[normal] to ensure the pipeline of skilled individuals into the Oil and Gas sector.
[normal]7
[normal].
[normal]4
[normal]              
[normal]I
[normal]ncreasing use of technology and automation is likely to result in a continuing contraction of the aggregates, mineral
[normal] and
[normal] coal industry workforce.  This in turn is creating a demand for highly skilled individuals with a wide range of talents and there are some reported skills shortages and hard to fill vacancies.   
[normal]7
[normal].
[normal]5
[normal]              
[normal]R
[normal]ecently, through a partnership with the Institute of Q
[normal]uarrying and Derby University, the industry has developed an online University Certificate in International Quarry Operations, mainly intended to support companies abroad. This partnership has 
[normal]la
[normal]unched a Centre f
[normal]or Mineral Products Professional Development
[normal], 
[normal]offer
[normal]ing
[normal] a wide range of industry developed higher level programmes. A higher level apprenticeship in Mineral Products Technology has also been launched, its development supported by the Government
[normal]’
[normal]s 
[normal]Higher Apprenticeship Fund. 
[normal]7
[normal].
[normal]6
[normal]              
[normal]We
[normal] will continue to improve the responsiveness of the skills system to the needs of business
[normal].  We are
[normal] promoting greater employer leadership and closer collaboration between business and higher education and further education colleges. 
[normal]7.7
[normal]              
[normal]It is important th
[normal]at business leads in developing the skilled workforce required to maintain the competitiveness of the UK
[normal]’
[normal]s extractive industries sector
[normal] and 
[normal]to enable its future growth
[normal].
[normal]  We expect businesses to work closely with bodies such as EU 
[normal]S
[normal]kills
[normal] (the Sector Skills
[normal] Council for Energy and Utilities), Cogent
[normal] (Chemicals, Nuclear, Oil and Gas, petroleum and Polymers) and OPITO to help identify the sectors current and future skills challenges.
[normal]7
[normal].8
[normal]              
[normal]Across all sectors of the U
[normal]K
[normal] economy
[normal], we have
[normal] acknowledged the broader challenge to improve 
[normal]science, technology, engineering and mathematics (
[normal]STEM
[normal])
[normal] skills
[normal].  The 
[normal]Government is funding
[normal] a number of initiatives 
[normal]aim
[normal]ed at increasing the number of young people taking 
[normal]STEM subjects
[normal] and 
[normal]improv
[normal]ing
[normal] the image of
[normal] 
[normal]manufacturing 
[normal]and engineering
[normal].  These include 
[normal]the STEM 
[normal]A

[normal] 
[normal]Perkins, 
[normal]is 
[normal]undertaking a review with industry and learned bodies such as the Royal Academy of Engineering 
[normal]so
[normal] we understand the scale of the engineering skills challenge in the UK.  
[normal]H
[normal]e 
[normal]will report
[normal] 
[normal]in the 
[normal]autumn
[normal].  The UK Commission for Employment and Skills also con
[normal]ducts work to understand the skills needs and challenges of key areas of the UK economy, including the energy sector

[normal]The 
[normal]UK sign
[normal]ed 
[normal]up to EITI to show leadership 
[normal]on extractives transparency 
[normal]and to 
[normal]encourage other countries to follow suit.
[normal]  
[normal]We are responding 
[normal]to concerns 
[normal]that potential EITI countries
[normal] are
[normal] deterred from joining the initiative due to the perception that
[normal] EITI
[normal] is designed for poor and corrupt countries.
[normal]  
[normal]The Government
[normal] 
[normal]aim
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]to 
[normal]send
[normal] a
[normal] 
[normal]clear message that EITI is a global standard for both developed as well as developing countries.

[normal]UK extractives companies operating in resource-rich countries benefit from lower reputational risk and better relat
[normal]ions with 
[normal]the 
[normal]communities 
[normal]where
[normal] they operate. EITI is a strong signal that the UK is a responsible operator, further enhancing 
[normal]our 
[normal]reputation abroad
[normal].
[normal]8
[normal].5
[normal]              
[normal]The UK getting 
[normal]our
[normal] 
[normal]own house in order will encourage others, including emerging economies, to sign up. As more countries join the EITI, overall global standards of transparency are raised, and together with mandatory reporting, this levels the playing field for UK companies.

[normal]9[bold].[bold]              [bold]Role of regulation [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]9
[normal].1
[normal]              
[normal]London is one of the world’s leading financial centres and attracts a wide range of companies to list on its markets.  One reason for this is 
[normal]our
[normal] legal and regulatory framework.  
[normal]While m
[normal]any companies list in their geographic home, other companies will have a choice of location and as a result the UK is in competition with other markets, in particular the US.  
[normal]A
[normal]ny decision to change the regulatory s
[normal]ystem would need to be taken in this context and maintain the competitiveness of the UK market for issuers whilst providing an appropriate degree of protection for investors. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9
[normal].2
[normal]              
[normal]Notwithstanding the need to maintain a competitive environment, the UK is r
[normal]egarded as a centre of excellence for best practice and corporate governance
[normal].  A high value is 
[normal]place
[normal]d
[normal] on the trust and transparency of 
[normal]the UK’s 
[normal]corporate governance framework.

[normal]The Financial Conduct Authority, as the independent regulator for the UK’s listing regime, consulted last October on proposals to enhance the effectiveness of the Listing Regime overall and in particular to provide greater protection to 
[normal]investors
[normal] 
[normal]in situations where there is a controlling shareholder.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]FCA is
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]intending to provide feedback on this consultation in early October.

[normal]The UK
[normal]’s expertise in oil and gas gives us a huge national advantage.  Government and industry 
[normal]are 
[normal]working together to keep the UK at the heart of the global race in the worldwide energy industry, creating jobs and growth.

[normal]The 
[normal]Oil &amp; Gas Industrial Strategy
[normal] 
[normal]was d
[normal]evelope
[normal]d in partnership with industry.  It
[normal] sets out a clear path to exploit the UK’s remaining resources and overcome an increasingly challenging production environment.

[normal]Since publication, the Oil &amp;
[normal] Gas Industry Council, supported by a BIS-led secretariat, has begun taking forward the actions listed in the strategy. Several have already been completed, and a number of key milestones are due to be finalised by the end of this year. One of the key deli
[normal]verables – a research project mapping the UK supply chain, including exports, by value and destination, to determine areas of constraint and potential opportunities for additional support – is now underway.

[normal]In addition, 
[normal]DECC commissioned an Oil and 
[normal]Gas Review
[normal] 
[normal]in June 2013
[normal].  This is be
[normal]ing led by Sir Ian Wood, who is
[normal] looking in depth at the key issues which need to be addressed to ensure
[normal] the
[normal] longevity of the industry and our resources.

[normal]              
[normal]With 
[normal]this 
[normal]increasing focus on environmental and governance 
[normal]considerations, the UK's comparative advantage in the professional services sector will increasingly be called upon to support these mining developments.  Coupled with the need to raise large capital investment for many mining developments ($20bn not being
[normal] unusual) the City of London will continue to be an important funding source.

[normal]The 
[normal]Competition Commission 
[normal]currently 
[normal]has an inquiry 
[normal]into the Aggregates, Cement and Ready Mix Concrete industries.
[normal] The outcome of the investigation will not be known until the end of 2013.
