[normal]Summary[bold]:[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Introduction:[bold]Dr Tobias Lock is a lecturer in EU law at the University of Edinburgh Law School and has published in the area of EU fundamental rights law.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Evidence: Application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the United Kingdom[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Applicability of the Charter in UK courts – Protocol No. 30
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]‘
[normal]The Charter does not affect in any way the right of Member States to legislate in the sphere of public morality, family law, as well as the protection of human dignity and respect for human physical and moral integrity.
[normal]’  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]‘P
[normal]oland declares that, having regard to the tradition of social movement of ‘Solidarity’ and its significant contribution to the struggle for social and labour rights, it fully respects social and labour rights, as established by European Union law, and in particular those reaffirmed in Title IV of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
[normal]’
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Charter does not extend the ability of the Court of Justice of the European Union, or any court or tribunal of Poland or of the United Kingdom, to find that the laws, regulations or administrative provisions, practices or action of Poland or of the United Kingdom are inconsistent with the fundamental rights, freedoms and principles that it reaffirms.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This Charter reaffirms
[normal] […] 
[normal]the rights as they result, in particular, from the constitutional traditions and international obligations common to the Member States, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the Social Charters adopted by the Union and by the Council of Europe and the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and of the European Court of Human Rights.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, shall constitute general principles of the Union’s law.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In particular, and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in Title IV of the Charter creates justiciable rights applicable to Poland or the United Kingdom except in so far as Poland or the United Kingdom has provided for s
[normal]uch rights in its national law.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In this Act 
[normal](a) all those rights, powers, liabilities, obligations and
[normal] restrictions from time to time 
[normal]created or arising by or under the [EU] Treaties, and
[normal](b) all those remedies and procedures from time to time provided for by or under the [EU] Treaties, 
[normal]are referred to as “EU law”.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This shows that the point of reference for the Act 
[normal]is 
[normal]the EU Treaties themselves.  This suggests that the Act looks to the EU Treaties to define under what circumstances they are applicable in the Member State legal orders and thus in Scotland.  Only 
[normal]where they are applicable
[normal] 
[normal]do they constitute ‘EU law’ and 
[normal]have the effect prescribed by s.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]29.  
[normal]Thus it is suggested that the Charter can only provide the basis for a finding under s.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]29 where it is applicable.  
[normal]However, there does not appear to be any case law on this very point, so that a definite answer cannot be given.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The legal framework for the operation of the Charter in the UK – action within the scope of EU law
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If the
[normal] Zambrano
[normal] principle
[normal] [i.e. EU law]
[normal] is applicable, then Article 7 of the European Charter on Fundamental Rights is engaged. If not, EU law is not engaged and the proportionality assessment has to be made, as it was in each of these cases, solely by reference to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

[normal] 
[normal]must not be interpreted in a way which would lead to the conclusion that the decision constituted an 
[normal]ultra vires 
[normal]act or in a way which would
[normal] 
[normal]endanger the protection by or enforcement of the Member State’s fundamental rights, which would call into question the identity of the constitutional order erected by the Basic Law [the German constitution].  In this sense the decision may not be understood and applied in a way that any reference of a provision to the abstract scope of Union law or purely factual effects on Union law would be sufficient for the Member States to be bound by the fundamental rights contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
