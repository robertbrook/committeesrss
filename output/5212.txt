[[[&#xa0;]]]Thank you for the opportunity to supply information to inform your inquiry. You asked two specific questions which I shall deal with in turn.&#xa0;Firstly, what, if any, targets do you set for your police force? What impact do you think this has on police recording crime practices?&#xa0;I have 8 specific targets contained within my Police and Crime Plan 2013-2017. Of those targets two relate to crime/incidents, as follows:&#xa0;&#xa0;I am not aware of any perverse impact on crime recording as the focus is upon all crime types. The Home Secretary stated the only target is to reduce crime. With this in mind I sought to stay at this level but to differentiate between crime and antisocial behaviour, which is an area often raised by my local residents. By my focusing upon all crime types the Constabulary is encouraged to see all crimes as equally important and generally no crime should be competing for priority. Of course there are occasions when it is in the public interest for a matter to be prioritised.&#xa0;Crime classification responsibility rests with frontline officers. I and my Chief Constable are committed to effective and strong leadership. Our value in integrity and data quality is reflected across all ranks. This helps to ensure crimes are recorded accurately, consistently and correctly within stipulated rules.&#xa0;However; the Chief Constable has focussed his officers through his own internal targets, with an emphasis on certain crime types such as; 'Serious Acquisitive Crime' and 'Violence against the Person', which are victim based crimes. &#xa0;Secondly; how do you assure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct? To what extent can you trust the crime statistics for your area?&#xa0;The integrity of force data is exceptionally important. It enables me to hold the Chief Constable to account on behalf of the people of Hampshire and Isle of Wight; building confidence amongst communities of the effectiveness of their constabulary.&#xa0;Crime recording data quality is reported on a monthly basis through the constabulary's performance profile. The monitoring is based on dip sampling data records for compliance with NCRS and Home Office counting rules. My performance management team provide regulars performance briefings and would raise any concerns relating to data quality.&#xa0;In addition, internal data audits are conducted by the Force Crime Registrar. I can ask for briefings and reports from the Force Crime Registrar at any time.&#xa0;Another mechanism for checking is through my engagement with the public. By listening to concerns and mapping those against crime data for consistency. &#xa0;I believe that having an open, honest dialogue with the Chief Constable, with a relationship built on respect and trust means I am confident in the reliability of the data. I am however not complacent and would call on my own scrutiny team, internal audit and even HMIC if I considered there were concerns.&#xa0;&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;
