[normal]Written evidence submitted by The University of Manchester (WSC014)[bold]1. 
[normal]              
[normal]The University of Manchester has nearly 40,000 students and more than 10,000 staff. The University is committed to creating an environment where diversity is celebrated and everyone is treated fairly regardless of gender, disability, ethnic origin, religio
[normal]n or belief, sexual orientation, marital status, age or nationality.  
[normal]2.
[normal]              
[normal] 
[normal]We are taking positive steps to achieve equality in the workplace and are committed to both meeting and exceeding our obligations under current legislation. As an academic instituti
[normal]on we believe that women are vital to the world of academia, and therefore find it relevant to respond to this inquiry.
[normal]3[bold].[bold]              [bold] [bold] [bold]Why do you think the number of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder? [bold]3.1
[normal]              
[normal] [bold]Work-life Balance:[bold] Whether we like it or not, 
[normal]women often carry the majority of childcare responsibility within the family and 
[normal]sometimes
[normal] it
[normal] 
[normal]c
[normal]an
[normal] be difficult to maintain an
[normal] academic career 
[normal]whilst
[normal] raising 
[normal]a family or having other significant
[normal] caring duties/o
[normal]bligations. Having 
[normal]children
[normal] etc, does inhibit opportunity to go abroad to conferences, etc, (activity which helps CV and promotion prospects), particularly if the academic female does not have other support around (at home).
[normal] Further, hours are often long and there is a lack 
[normal]of flexible/part time working opportunities giving the perception that there is not a healthy work life balance amongst academic 
[normal]staff.
[normal] Where flexibility or part-time worki
[normal]ng does exist there is a perception
[normal] 
[normal]that career
[normal] progress
[normal]ion is more difficult,
[normal] as qu
[normal]antity is valued and quality alone is not enough.
[normal] For those women who decide not to raise a family there are still issues which include structural issues, bias etc.
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal] [bold]Recognition:[bold] Women can 
[normal]be engaged in a disproportionate number of service 
[normal]activities t
[normal]hat benefit the School, for example being an admissions/year tutor
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]as a result
[normal] may not
[normal] have the capacity to work on activities that would better serve 
[normal]promotion
[normal] prospects
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The achievements 
[normal]of 
[normal]women 
[normal]can be left 
[normal]unrecognised because 
[normal]in general, 
[normal]women are often 
[normal]less good at 
[normal]market
[normal]ing
[normal] themselves 
[normal]than men
[normal]. 
[normal]A recent study of research abstracts by Ohio State University demonstrates
[normal] that both female and male students believe that papers written by women are of lower quality than papers written by men. 
[normal]Women therefore need to ‘outperform’ men to gain appropriate recognition.
[normal]3.3
[normal]              [bold] [bold]Lack of Confidence:[bold] W
[normal]omen generally take longer 
[normal]or are more cautious about applying
[normal] for promo
[normal]tion as they want to make sure they meet 
[normal]every criterion fully before submitting an 
[normal]application.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]3.4
[normal] [bold]              [bold]Lack of Opportunities:[bold] Recruitment processes can be 
[normal]problematic;
[normal] especially the higher up the ladder one goes. For example, ‘search committees’ are often 
[normal]dominated by men who only access
[normal] their own networks (which usually are made up of other men) so potential female candidates do not get identified or approached early on in the recruitment process. 
[normal]A bigger issue is that 
[normal]many senior academic roles do not
[normal] even have search committees.
[normal]3.5
[normal] [bold]              [bold]Career Breaks:[bold] Any career breaks that do take place seem to affect career paths
[normal],
[normal] and the working environment is not always sensitive or accommodating to individual circumstances. 
[normal]3.6
[normal]              [bold] [bold]Lack of Role Models:[bold] The number of female guest speakers and images of 
[normal]women on display is minimal or non-existent which means there is a lack of visible role models.  Women are often not encouraged by peers to network and be at the fore-front of the School.
[normal] Further, there is a 
[normal]distinct lack of successful female role models w
[normal]ith families which 
[normal]can create a
[normal] perception that it is not possible for academics to combine a
[normal] successful career 
[normal]with a family
[normal].
[normal]3.7
[normal] [bold]              [bold]Unconscious Bias[bold]: As a result of unconscious bias often similar people to that of the recruiter
[normal](s)
[normal] are employed which leads 
[normal]to a culture where there is not a diverse range of people, often with white males dominating.  Many institutions are starting to deliver training on this but there can be a lack of take-up of this training by those who need it most.
[normal] Unconscious bias also e
[normal]xtends to matters including lack of invitations to speak at seminars or international conferences – such invitations are important to promotion. This is a common problem.
[normal]3.8
[normal] [bold]              [bold]Leadership Style:[bold] 
[normal]Women 
[normal]often perceive that aggressive political skills are required at 
[normal]the top of the career ladder 
[normal]or in positions of authority, 
[normal]as they 
[normal]may 
[normal]not want to 
[normal]adopt this 
[normal]style of leadership
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Not 
[normal]always, but often the male dominated leadership style can be aggressive a
[normal]nd riddled with unconscious bias.
[normal]3.9
[normal] [bold]              [bold]Lack of Mentoring Opportunities:[bold] [bold]Mentoring
[normal] to early career researchers
[normal] is often performed by senior academics on an informal basis. Senior academics are usually male, and either consciously or unconsciously t
[normal]hey t
[normal]end 
[normal]to choose people similar to themselves (i
[normal].
[normal]e. males) to mentor.
[normal]3.10
[normal] [bold]              [bold]Lack of Career Structure:[bold] 
[normal]Career progression, for example by publication, funding and collaborations are difficult if you have a career break (e.g. maternity leave) and it is important that institutions help women returning from maternity leave to get their research career back on 
[normal]track. 
[normal]Moreover, 
[normal]the structural problem
[normal] whereby postdoctoral researchers
[normal] 
[normal]are required to complete 
[normal]a series of fixed term positions before 
[normal]starting a permanent academic career track can dissuade women
[normal]. Contracts that are offered to women are usually short t
[normal]erm which means female academics have to move around Universities more often
[normal], which is not 
[normal]ideal, especially for those who wish to stay in one place so that they can raise children
[normal], or have commitments as family carers
[normal]. Further, there is a perception that 
[normal]there is not a healthy work life balance amongst academic staff and 
[normal]that women are drawn to industry where 
[normal]the pay is much better
[normal].
[normal]3.11
[normal]              [bold] [bold]Examples of supporting STEM academic women at The University of Manchester:[bold]3.12 
[normal]              
[normal]The University of Manchester is commi
[normal]tted to Athena SWAN Charter for Women in Science and its principles. The University has held a Bronze Award since 2008 and s
[normal]o far, four awards are held by Schools. The other eleven STEMM Schools are currently working towards awards, with the support of the
[normal] dedicated University’s Athena SWAN Coordinator and a commitment to making a long term cultural change which will benefit all staff.

[normal]P
[normal]ublicity 
[normal]materials 
[normal]depict both men and women and
[normal],
[normal] during Open Days for potential students
[normal],
[normal] female staff speak at events, conduct interviews and show round candidates. 
[normal]3.14 
[normal]              
[normal]Faculty-wide Academic Promotions Masterclass workshops are d
[normal]elivered every year, 
[normal]and are advertised with a positive action statement to encourage women to attend
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]to 
[normal]suppor
[normal]t staff in submitting promotion cases. Furthermore Schools offer CV clinics for individually tailored support. 
[normal]3.15 
[normal]              
[normal]U
[normal]nconscious bias training 
[normal]has been delivered 
[normal]for the benefit of those on recruitment/promotion panels, to raise awareness of this issue an
[normal]d for them to consider their own biases during recruitment/promotion processes. This is being developed to be included in mandatory recruitment and selection training for all recruiters.
[normal]3.16 
[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]he University of Manchester 
[normal]has 
[normal]strong network groups for staf
[normal]f and students, including a Peer Support Group for Women Returning from Maternity Leave, International Staff Network Group and Women in Science, Engineering and Technology (WiSET). The groups organise events throughout the year and the 
[normal]U
[normal]niversity allows me
[normal]mbers up to eight hours per year to be dedicated to network group activities from their standard working hours. 
[normal]3.17 
[normal]              
[normal]The
[normal] University of Manchester 
[normal]has
[normal] a number of family-friendly policies including flexible working,
[normal] career break and special leave. F
[normal]amily-friendly support includes childcare initiatives to help reduce costs with a 
[normal]salary exchange scheme for paying for childcare, childcare vouchers and two on site nurseries. 
[normal]3.18
[normal]              
[normal]Our Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences has established a Fellowship Ac
[normal]ademy that provides concentrated support for those people wanting to secure fellowships.
[normal]4.[bold]              [bold] [bold]When women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? [bold]4.1 
[normal]Women often work in industry
[normal], the NHS
[normal] or for a government agency after they le
[normal]ave academia.  Alternatively 
[normal]women 
[normal]tend to 
[normal]develop careers in
[normal] communications
[normal] and human resources. 
[normal] 
[normal]5.[bold] [bold]              [bold]What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in different employment sectors?[bold]5.1
[normal]              
[normal]Loss of highly trained and highly [bold]skilled people:[bold] 
[normal]Lo
[normal]sing a high proportion of the bright and skilled population overall, often into jobs that do not take full advantage of 
[normal]their 
[normal]skills and training (there is strong evidence that women have pay that is on average much worse than men with eq
[normal]uivalent qualifications)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]is bad for the UK economy.
[normal]5.
[normal]2
[normal] [bold]              [bold]Loss of[bold] role models in academia[bold]:[bold] There is a
[normal]lready a
[normal] distinct lack of successful f
[normal]emale role models (including those with families) 
[normal]so 
[normal]female 
[normal]graduates 
[normal]perceive
[normal] academia as somewhere not to have a successful career and a family. In addition graduates do not get the opportunity to talk to academics to see what it is like to pursue an academic career
[normal] and with women moving into industry, the prevalence of advice fro
[normal]m women would decrease further
[normal]. It is often assumed that graduates have knowledge about career choices, but this is not always the case, 
[normal]and
[normal] 
[normal]so
[normal] career support is needed, including talks from female academics
[normal].
[normal]5.
[normal]3
[normal] [bold]              [bold]Industry will be[bold] seen as the natural progr[bold]ession for women (not academia)[bold]: [bold]If students are not able to identify themselves with
[normal] [bold]staff at the University 
[normal]they 
[normal]will choose
[normal] to work elsewhere following their graduation. 
[normal] [bold]Many go into teaching or non-STE
[normal]M
[normal]M related careers.
[normal]5.
[normal]4
[normal] [bold]              [bold]Male domination:[bold] [bold]Statistics show
[normal] that academia is often crowded by
[normal] senior
[normal] male academics. Losing women to different employment sectors will only make 
[normal]this situation 
[normal]worse and further
[normal] will enhance the 
[normal]stereotype that only men are suitable for academic positions in STEM
[normal]M
[normal].
[normal]5.
[normal]5
[normal] [bold]              [bold]Lack of diversity [bold]in higher education:[bold] 
[normal]Diversity is a business driver and there is real evidence around diverse teams leading to better 
[normal]organisational
[normal] performance
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.
[normal]6
[normal] [bold]              [bold]Decrease in ideas and innovation[bold]:
[normal] 
[normal]A diverse group of people is needed to progress 
[normal]and deliver the best. It has been proven that people from similar backgrounds have similar thinking patterns and therefore
[normal] fail to produce novel policies and ideas
[normal]. Diversity is 
[normal]a prime
[normal] catalyst for new ideas and innovation and therefore the retention of w
[normal]omen in academia is greatly needed.
[normal]              [bold] [bold]To retain women in academia, The University of Manchester offers the following:[bold]5.
[normal]7
[normal]              [bold]Equality and Diversity Training:  [bold]All 
[normal]members of staff are required to complete an online equality and diversity training module. 
[normal] This is 
[normal]included as part of the induction for new members of staff. 
[normal]5.
[normal]8
[normal] [bold]              [bold]Unconscious Bias Training: [bold]Unconscious bias training has been
[normal] delivered to those on recruitment/promotion panels, to raise awareness of this issue and for them to consider their own
[normal] biases during recruitment/promotion processes. 
[normal]This is currently being developed to be included in
[normal] the
[normal] mandatory recruitment and selection training for all recruiters.
[normal]5.
[normal]9
[normal] [bold]              [bold]Research Time:  [bold]Academics returning from maternity leave are offered a 6 month period, in which they are relieved of teaching duties so that they can focus on their research work. 
[normal]5.1
[normal]0
[normal]              [bold] [bold]Generous Maternity Leave[bold]/Support[bold]: [bold]The University 
[normal]offers a substantial maternity leave
[normal] package which includes 6 months full pay, plus 3 months statutory pay.
[normal] 
[normal]Whilst on maternity leave the University offers 5 ‘keeping in touch’
[normal] days, which are paid and
[normal] 
[normal]not t
[normal]aken out of the maternity leave period
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]The University also has a staff network 
[normal]group specifically for those returning to
[normal] work after having a child
[normal] for additional support. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.[bold] [bold]              [bold]What should universities and the higher education sector do to retain women graduates and [bold]PhD[bold] students in academic careers?[bold]6.1
[normal]              [bold] [bold]Career Support:[bold] Clear career advice should be available which is sensitive to diversity and gender and a clear career structure should be provided detailing what career paths they can take so that they can make an informed decision about their career choice. Improved inf
[normal]ormation and communication on internal jobs, and accessibility to positions is critical, to increase the chances of the graduate/PhD Student remaining at the institution.
[normal]6.2
[normal] [bold]              [bold]PI Support:[bold] Principal Investigators should be better supported to understand and
[normal] deliver mentoring &amp; career advice as this is often the person the graduates look to for support. It is important that PIs are involved with the Researcher Development Team so they are able to offer the graduates all the opportunities open to them. 
[normal]6.3
[normal]              [bold] [bold]N[bold]etworking:[bold] Improve opportunities for networking so graduates/students have the chance to meet early career researchers/lecturers and hear their stories about how they made the transition from student to staff. Cross-faculty and multi-disciplinary events op
[normal]en more doors across the University where they would be able to work based on their expertise in particular fields.  
[normal]6.4
[normal] [bold]              [bold]Role Models:[bold] Showcase and celebrate successful female academics.  Ensure that conferences, seminars and events include female speaker
[normal]s wherever possible.
[normal]6.5
[normal] [bold]              [bold]Communication:[bold] Ensure staff and students are aware of the policies in place to help support women so concerns from students can be answered quickly or found out easily. Running events where women graduates can see/hear that it is 
[normal]possible to be a mother and an academic and highlighting the support available following maternity leave is important. 
[normal]6.6
[normal] [bold]              [bold]Work-life balance:[bold] We need to look at the environment within higher education where the long hours culture still dominates.  If we 
[normal]want to encourage and retain women then we need to do more to support those who want to work part-time, flexibly or take a career break and for there to be opportunities for
[normal] them to progress their career.
[normal] We also need to stop the long-hours culture
[normal] to show
[normal] it 
[normal]is possible to work successfully whil
[normal]st
[normal] retaining a work-life balance.
[normal]6.7
[normal] [bold]              [bold]The University of Manchester supports females who wish to pursue an academic career in the following ways:   [bold]The University 
[normal]h
[normal]as forums and networks for graduates and stud
[normal]ents 
[normal]to share their experiences with each other and staff. There are also
[normal] formal mentoring schemes where students are linked with an experienced member of staff and schemes where students can assist their peers. Other examples of good practice we have to ensure
[normal] that women progress into academic careers
[normal] are listed below in 7
[normal]. 
[normal]7. [bold] [bold]              [bold]Have you any example of good practice? [bold]Forums for graduates and students to share experiences [bold]For example at The University of Manchester we have:
[normal]7.
[normal]1
[normal] [bold]              [bold]Women in Science, Engineering [bold]and Technology (WiSET):[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]A network for all female students, research and academic staff in the Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences.
[normal]7.
[normal]2
[normal]              [bold]Women in Life Sciences:[bold] A
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]developing network for all female academic and research staff, administrative staff an
[normal]d students within Life Sciences at The University of Manchester.
[normal]7.
[normal]3
[normal]              [bold] [bold]Women in I.T.:[bold] 
[normal]A
[normal] networking forum for women at all grades working in IT across the University.
[normal]7.
[normal]4
[normal]              [bold] [bold]Networking [bold]: [bold]For example at The University of Manchester we have:
[normal]7.
[normal]5
[normal]              [bold]School PhD and [bold]PDRA Forums:[bold] Students &amp; Research Staff from different research groups in the School can meet regularly (usually once a quarter) to see what others are doing and share experiences. 
[normal]7.
[normal]6
[normal]              [bold]EPS Ambassadors: [bold]PDRAs engage cross-faculty
[normal] [bold]which opens up opportunitie
[normal]s for research in different Schools
[normal]7.
[normal]7
[normal]              [bold]Research Staff Association:[bold] Open to researchers across the University (4 Faculties) to share experiences about life as a researcher and to discuss topics of interest (for example: fixed term contracts, open access pu
[normal]blishing and extended access). Manchester RSA actively engages with Vitae’s UK Research Staff Association (UKRSA). The first RSA Manchester Mini Sandpit was organised in 2012 which was a compressed version of the interactive, multidisciplinary workshops us
[normal]ed by funding bodies to drive lateral thinking and radical approaches to research challenges.
[normal]All research forums work with the 
[normal]Researcher Development Team[bold] at The University of Manchester and there are a number of funds available, such as the “School Resea
[normal]rch Conferences Fund”, the “Researcher Led Initiatives Fund” and the “External Training Fund” to support local initiatives. A recent event (March 2013) funded by the Researcher Led Initiative, “
[normal]Life after post doc: What can 
[normal]happen next?”,
[normal] [bold]was organised by 
[normal]the
[normal] [bold]School of Physics and Astronomy Researcher Development Forum where researchers and fellows from the School heard stories from four speakers from academia, industry and the public sector to help researchers understand the different options open to them 
[normal]after their current positions finish.  
[normal]7.
[normal]8
[normal]              [bold]Mentoring schemes[bold]For example at The University of Manchester we have:
[normal] 
[normal]7.
[normal]9
[normal] [bold]              [bold]Manchester Gold Mentoring Scheme: [bold]Students are matched on a one to one basis with an experienced member of staff (a mentor) and will be
[normal] in contact with them over a nine month period. The programme aims to help students with career planning and decision making about their future options
[normal].
[normal]7.1
[normal]0
[normal] [bold]              [bold]Peer Assisted Study Sessions (PASS): [bold]A Student Learning Scheme
[normal] [bold]that is ran by students and provid
[normal]es a facilitated, group learning opportunity that uses the experiences of higher year students to support the learning of lower year peers
[normal].[bold]7.11
[normal]              
[normal] 
[normal]The University of Manchester also provides a 
[normal]‘Buddy System’[bold] which links PhD students to a PDRA.  In some Schoo
[normal]ls PhD students and PDRAs in the same research group share an office to help facilitate this and allow for everyday interaction between staff and students.
[normal]7.1
[normal]2
[normal]              [bold] [bold]Career service[bold] 
[normal]The University of Manchester provides a career service to all students during 
[normal]their studies and for two years after they graduate. In 2011 the careers service won the 'Times Higher Education Award for Outstanding Support for Early Career Researchers' for their dedicated academic career website for PhD and research staff. Recently (F
[normal]ebruary 2013) the 
[normal]Head of Post Graduate Career Development offered advice to students about PhD applications and career prospects in academic field, at the 
[normal]Faculty wide WiSET event, 
[normal]Is an Academic Career for You
[normal].[bold] 
[normal]8[bold].[bold]              [bold] [bold]What role should the Government have [bold]in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers?[bold]8.1 
[normal]              
[normal]The government must offer support and recognition for women who juggle academic commitments and family commitments. Better maternity leave support from funding bodies should be provided s
[normal]o that all the support does not have to come through the University
[normal]. W
[normal]omen need see that they can have a career break, return to work and go on to further their career. 
[normal]8.2 
[normal]              
[normal]It would also greatly help if there was better support for 
[normal]partners
[normal] in terms of l
[normal]eave so that a couple can jointly care for their child, without the woman missing out on key progression points in her career.
[normal] 
[normal]8.3 
[normal]              
[normal]Programmes such as Athena SWAN should be more heavily invested in by the Government as they make a considerable impact on the number of departments that work towards gender equality.
