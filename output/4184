defaultMy background
defaultI
default was head of Applied Physics at the Institute of Hydrology (now the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology)
default for 25 years, since when I have
default been Director of TerraData Ltd, a consultancy in environmental monitoring. All of this work has concerned the development and use of instruments for measuring the main climatic variables and has involved travel to many remote
default parts of the world where I ha
defaultve
default witnessed first-hand how the climate is measured under a gr
defaulteat variety of conditions. I am
default currently working on better snowf
defaultall measurements in
default Antarctica, improved methods of measuring air temperature and investigating how climate model projections of 
defaulttemperature compare w
defaultith the instrument record. I am
default a Fellow of the Royal Meteor
defaultological Society (RMetS) and have
default written several books (
defaultwww.ianstrangeways.org.uk
default) and many articles and papers, as well as giving talks and university lectures
default (the Open University and Newcastle University)
