[normal]Written evidence submitted by[bold] [bold]Dr [bold]Ian Strangeways (IPC0022)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Executive Summary[bold]The answers to the 
[normal]following eight questions 
[normal]are based on my experience of working in meteorology and 
[normal]hydrology for the last 50 years (
[normal]see ‘My background’
[normal] below
[normal]). I have no ties with the IPCC and no involvement with any coal, oil or gas organisation. My answers are as objective as possible. Questions are in bold font, answers in italics. Questions concerni
[normal]ng government policy are not considered; only scientific matters are addressed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My background
[normal]I
[normal] was head of Applied Physics at the Institute of Hydrology (now the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology)
[normal] for 25 years, since when I have
[normal] been Director of TerraData Ltd, a consultancy in environmental monitoring. All of this work has concerned the development and use of instruments for measuring the main climatic variables and has involved travel to many remote
[normal] parts of the world where I ha
[normal]ve
[normal] witnessed first-hand how the climate is measured under a gr
[normal]eat variety of conditions. I am
[normal] currently working on better snowf
[normal]all measurements in
[normal] Antarctica, improved methods of measuring air temperature and investigating how climate model projections of 
[normal]temperature compare w
[normal]ith the instrument record. I am
[normal] a Fellow of the Royal Meteor
[normal]ological Society (RMetS) and have
[normal] written several books (
[normal]www.ianstrangeways.org.uk
[normal]) and many articles and papers, as well as giving talks and university lectures
[normal] (the Open University and Newcastle University)
[normal], 
[normal]on these interrelated topics. I
[normal] was awarded the 
[normal]Gordon Manley Weather Prize
[normal] in 2005 
[normal]‘
[normal]for outstanding contributions to the 
[normal]RMetS journal 
[normal]Weather
[normal]’
[normal] and the 
[normal]Vaisala Award
[normal] in 2012 
[normal]‘
[normal]in recognition of my
[normal] work in the field of observation and instrumentation of significant value to the science of meteorology
[normal]’
[normal].  
[normal]The questions addressed in this note are very important indeed and being d
[normal]irectly relat
[normal]ed to the above work, called
[normal] for a response
[normal] from me
[normal].
