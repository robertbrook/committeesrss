"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Christopher Gillham (SRN 016)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n‘\nTelle est la faiblesse de notre raison: elle ne sert le plus souvent qu’à justifier nos croyances’   \nMarcel Pagnol – La Gloire de Mon Père\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPage \n9\n of \n10\n I use the male pronoun to represent a person of either gender,  to avoid the infelicity of using the gender-free 3\nrd\n person plural.\n This is not exactly apocryphal - i\nn 1897 Representative T.I. Record of Posen County introduced House Bill #246 in the Indiana House of Representatives.\n  He proposed that \n\n take one of three rational numbers.  Whether this was silly season politics or a serious attempt to deny reality is not recorded.\n \n‘\"The fallacy of composition\" is a logical error - a mistaken belief that what seems good for an individual will still be good when others do the same thing. For example, someone who stands at a crowded concert may get a better view of the stage. But if everyone at the concert stands up, nobody's view is improved.’\n  \nFast Food Nation; Eric Schlosser p119\n It seems more concerned that Britain is falling behind other nations in its provision of roads than it is with attempting  to show what the economic benefit might be.\n E.g. \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand\n&#xa0;\n E.g. Blueprint 5: The True Costs of Road Transport ; Maddison D, Pearce D, Johansson O, Calthrop E, Litman T &amp;Verhoef E; Earthscan, London 1996\n And we should remember that these estimates made in the mid-nineties were before the extent of air pollution costs were understood and certainly massively underestimated the climate change consequences of transport emissions\n There are a number of studies of externalisation, none of which come to a contrary verdict to Pearce.  The DfT have never released any statement refuting these studies or reported on any research of their own.\n Arguably those least likely to own a car are the poorest, who suffer from lack of such mobility in very many other ways (facilities, shops etc. move further away from them) brought about by the mobility of those they subsidise. \n It seems extraordinary that the government is putting money into increasing capacity in a system with falling demand – why not put it all into a system with increasing demand – rail (which is probably less subsidised and subsidies are declining)?\n \n‘The Myth of Travel Time Saving’\n; D Metz; \nTransport Reviews, Vol. 28, No. 3, 321–336, May 2008\n To be fair to the DfT they did not see an economic case for this hugely damaging scheme – the Chancellor overruled them.\n Though the Inspector at the Westbury Bypass Inquiry in Wiltshire did look critically at the claims of economic benefit and reduction of out-commuting. \n"
