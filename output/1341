[normal]Executive Summary:
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are more than 6,500 level crossings in Britain. Every day they save thousands 
[normal]of lives by protecting us from one of the busiest rail networks in the world.
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Network Rail invests in a wide-ranging 
[normal]programme
[normal], working with national and local 
[normal]organisations
[normal], to ensure that level crossings are safe and helping people use them correctly.
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There have been a number of high profile and tragic incidents at level crossings over the years, suggesting more needs to be done to educate drivers about the risks at level crossings. Combining education with 'enforcement' will ensure compliance is maintained.
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]StarTraq
[normal] traffic enforcement systems are designed to help the Police discourage individuals from breaking the rules.
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Some traffic offences are criminal and so enforced by the Police, others are civil offences and enforced by local authorities.
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Enforcement activity is also carried out by private contractors, for example controlling parking on private land.
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]StarTraq's
[normal] history and core expertise stems from working with the Police and enforcement agencies to process traffic offences. Our systems are both secure and flexible.
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]StarTraq's
[normal] modular system can provide Network Rail and BTP with an integrated solution, which can provide adjudication, document management and automated workflow allowing offenders to be processed according to the severity of the offence, offering educational alternatives to 'Fixed Penalty'.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction:[bold]1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]StarTraq
[normal] seeks to drive safety enhancements for all road users through 
[normal]education [bold]and enforcement. [bold]StarTraq
[normal] software solutions are designed for processing different 
[normal]types of offences and for delivering 
[normal]targeted online education. 21 of the UK's Police 
[normal]Forces use 
[normal]StarTraq
[normal] systems to process their traffic offences, improving their efficiency 
[normal]while maintaining high road safety standards.
[normal]2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are many reasons why people commit offences on the road: understanding 
[normal]these reasons is 
[normal]key
[normal] to changing driver 
[normal]behaviour
[normal]. For some, the certainty of 
[normal]punishment through effective enforcement of the law is the best deterrent to offending 
[normal]or re-offending. Others respond positively to education that raises knowledge and 
[normal]awareness of the potential dangers and impact of their actions.
[normal]3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]StarTraq
[normal] solutions support both 
[normal]enforcers [bold]who need to identify offenders and process 
[normal]penalties quickly and efficiently, and 
[normal]educators [bold]who require the ability to 
[normal]identify,
[normal] 
[normal]profile and divert individuals to 
[normal]programmes
[normal] that are relevant to their particular offence 
[normal]and psychological profile.
[normal]4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]StarTraq
[normal] solutions cover:
[normal]Enforcement:[bold] 
[normal]StarTraq's
[normal] back office solution automates the processing of 
[normal]offences, improving productivity and compliance. It can be used for both police 
[normal]and civil enforcement;
[normal]Education:[bold] 
[normal]StarTraq
[normal] software can be used to identify and divert appropriate 
[normal]candidates onto driver education 
[normal]programmes
[normal].
[normal]5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]StarTraq
[normal] has a strong 12 year track record in the international enforcement 
[normal]arena. 
[normal]StarTraq
[normal] pioneered a public/private partnership in the South African offence 
[normal]management industry in 1999, and entered the UK market in 2001. A 
[normal]StarTraq
[normal] 
[normal]modular system is now used by over 50% of the Police Forces England, Wales and 
[normal]Northern Ireland to automate traffic offence management.
[normal]6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]StarTraq's
[normal] contribution to the UK transport industry was 
[normal]recognised
[normal] with a 'Highly 
[normal]Commended' in the Technology Category of the 2008 National Transport Awards and 
[normal]is shortlisted for the Transport Operator of the Year Award in the 2013 National 
[normal]Transport Awards to be held in October 2013
[normal]7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]StarTraq
[normal] processes over 1 
[normal]million [bold]traffic offences and handled over 
[normal]2 million [bold]documents annually.
[normal]8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]StarTraq
[normal] solutions deliver a virtually paper free environment for our customers and the 
[normal]company was awarded ISO 14001 environmental accreditation.
[normal]9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] Having all offences handled via one single platform provides the additional benefit of efficient and accurate reporting.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Evidence for consideration:[bold]10.
[normal] 
[normal]A 
[normal]StarTraq
[normal] system has the ability to automatically read a vehicle registration mark and offence details using optical character recognition (OCR) and automatic number plate 
[normal]recognition (ANPR) on both analogue and digital offences. Alternatively, if ANPR data 
[normal]is provided by the camera technology then this can be uploaded to a 
[normal]StarTraq
[normal] system 
[normal]and displayed alongside the offence image.
[normal]11.
[normal] 
[normal]The System can be deployed securely on the Cloud, so it is ideal for remote locations 
[normal]such as level crossings.
[normal]12.
[normal] 
[normal]With a direct connection to the Police National Computer (PNC) a 
[normal]StarTraq
[normal] system 
[normal]can check the vehicle and keeper identity reporting back to the verifier the keeper's 
[normal]address details and the current status of the vehicle (for example, if it has been 
[normal]reported stolen).
[normal]13.
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]StarTraq
[normal] system can display multiple images and video clips to the verifier. Image 
[normal]enhancement tools allow the verifier to accurately record offences. Rejection codes 
[normal]for exempt vehicles (such as police, ambulance and fire engines) can be used so that 
[normal]an outcome for every offence is achieved.
[normal]14.
[normal] 
[normal]The output from 
[normal]StarTraq
[normal] system is a comprehensive file of driver names, addresses 
[normal]and date of birth along with offence details ready for processing. This output file can 
[normal]also be 
[normal]customised
[normal] ready to export to a 3rd party system, such as education course 
[normal]provider.
[normal]15.
[normal] 
[normal]Tools for adding officer issued tickets to the database are also available.
[normal]16.
[normal] 
[normal]A 
[normal]StarTraq
[normal] system will help Network Rail to:
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Process offences without the need for adding to headcount thereby keeping costs down and guaranteeing a return on investment.
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Centralise
[normal] processing of offences maintaining the flexibility to allow for multi-
[normal]site operations.
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Operate a system that is flexible, user friendly and dynamic.
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Customise
[normal] the workflow to map a process bespoke to Network Rail/BTP 
[normal]automating much of the offence lifecycle.
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Give confidence that a 
[normal]StarTraq
[normal] system is camera vendor independent 
[normal]software supporting interfaces from all camera types.
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Provide a seamless diversion of offenders to court or driver education —
[normal]determined by Network Rail.
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Provide court files at the click of a button.
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Future proof
[normal] a system protecting against any legislation and camera hardware 
[normal]changes.
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Reduce on-going IT support costs.
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Send correspondence in multiple languages to offenders and/or refer offenders 
[normal]to a website for trusted translation.
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]View offence images online and any other details that Network Rail/BTP deem 
[normal]appropriate.
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Fully integrate with handheld devices or scan paper tickets supporting process 
[normal]officer manually generated issued tickets.
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Offer e-learning as part of an overall driver education strategy. 
[normal]Recommendation:[bold]17.
[normal] 
[normal]StarTraq's
[normal] recommended solution to support level crossing safety improvements is for 
[normal]Network Rail and its enforcement partner (BTP) to 
[normal]adopt an enforcement protocol that 
[normal]is fair, transparent, trusted and reliable. A 
[normal]StarTraq
[normal] system will provide a sophisticated workflow and document management capability Network Rail to process level crossing 
[normal]offences from different camera types through to a successful outcome e.g. fine, 
[normal]education or court.
[normal]18.
[normal] 
[normal]StarTraq
[normal] recommends that Government looks to introduce an enforcement solution for 
[normal]level crossing safety, drawing on the results and benefits that have been gained by 
[normal]other enforcement agencies. By taking a targeted approach to casualty reduction 
[normal]where education and enforcement work together, compliance at level crossings will be 
[normal]achieved.
[normal]19.
[normal] 
[normal]Lastly 
[normal]StarTraq
[normal] recommends that the Office of Rail Regulator (ORR) works with the 
[normal]Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety and Royal Society for Prevention 
[normal]of Accidents (
[normal]RoSPA
[normal]) to devise a comprehensive package of educational courses 
[normal]aimed at Level Crossing offenders so that road users are offered a real alternative to a fixed penalty once an offence has been committed.
