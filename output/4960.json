"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by \n \nCare for the Wild International\n&#xa0;\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIntroduction\nCare for the Wild International submits this document for consideration at the inquiry into the keeping of primates as pets in the UK by the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee. \nCare for the Wild is \nan international wildlife \ncharity\n based in the \nUK,\n \nwhich has worked for \nto the protection of wildlife in the UK and around the globe\n for 30 years. \nA\ns a member of ENDCAP, Care for the Wild International was a key partner in producing the\n ENDCAP report, Wild Pets in the European Union, launched at the Eu\nropean Parliament on 3rd October 2012\n. \n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nExecutive Summary\nThe keeping of primates as pets presents\n many issues including t\nhe impact on \nthe individual primate’s \nwelfare, \nthe \nconservation of\n wild populations and \nthe \nprevention of \nthe \nillegal trade\n, as well a\ns the possible tr\nansmission of disease or\n injury to humans\n. \n&#xa0;\n3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOverview\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWithin the UK, \nit is estimated that there could be as many as 15,000-20,000 primates as pets.\n \nMuch of the trade in primates within the UK is done privately and so \nit is \nhard to monitor exact numbers. Most t\nrade appears to normally occur in private, making monitoring difficult. Breeders and private dealers are believed to be the main source of pet primates.\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs a group, primates are recognised as being highly intelligent an\nimals with complex emotional and physical needs and capabilities. As such, when kept in any form of captivity, they must be cared for by qualified individuals \nthough\n evidence suggests many privately owned primates do not receive suitable care. Solitary hou\nsing, early separation from the mother and inappropriate housing are just some of the husbandry practices likely to cause welfare problems in pet primates.\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the wild, many primate species are threatened by habitat \ndegradation\n, \nbush meat hunting, and \ncap\nture for the pet trade. \nLegal trade in wild species\n (or products deriving \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nfrom them)\n can often lead to an illegal trade supplied t\nhrough the poaching of wildlife – this has been notable especially in the ivory trade.\n Wide scale \nillegal \npoaching has been\n \nshown to fund other illegal activities such as terrorism\n, weapons trade\n and drug smuggling and poaching is\n driving \nmany\n species to extinction. \nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor\n \neach wild pet that does end up in someone’s home, numerous others may have died along the way. For every wi\nld animal captured and sold as a wild pet, an estimated 50 may be killed or die in transit.\ne)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWild in nature and often unpredictable, some \nprimates\n are potentially \nvery \ndangerous to people, and able to inflict severe physical injury or transmit unusual and \nharmful diseases\n such as\n hepatitis A, tuberculosis, monkey pox and herpesvirus simiae-B\n. \nIf the animal escapes, it could present further danger to UK wildlife populations. \nf)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCurrent legislation for primates offers protection by the Animal Welfare Act (AWA)\n 2006 and some species require a licence to be kept as pets under the Dangerous Wild Animals Act (DWAA) 1976. International trade is controlled by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). \nHowever, t\nhe current Code of Practice on\n the Welfare of privately owned primates cannot be legally enforced and the information therein only offers generic advice insufficient for the wide ranging species that make up the primate pet trade.\n \nA number of countries have now introduced legislation t\no ban, regulate or restrict the private keeping of pet primates, including Denmark, Bulgaria, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Canada, the US, Australia, Israel, Mexico and Honduras.\ng)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhile the need for specific guidelines for the keeping of p\nrimates as pets has been recognised, we are concerned that there are no provisions for an auditable licensing system for keepers of these animals, which would enable oversight of adherence to current legislation. \n&#xa0;\n4)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRecommendations\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCare for the Wild believ\nes that it is extremely difficult to achieve the suitable provision of welfare standards for primates in private ownership, and that the keeping of primates by private collectors can have adverse consequences for their welfare, as well as their conservatio\nn status in the wild in some circumstances. \nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCare for the Wild feels that t\nhe need for keeping primates should show clear purpose beyond that of simply being a companion animal or pastime. \nAs a welfare and conservation charity, we \nrecommend\n that the keeping of any primate should be solely for the conservation of the species o\nr the welfare of an individual and not for private collections.\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe strongly support legislation being \nproposed\n in the United Kingdom to restrict the private ownership of\n primates to purposes other than pet ownership, namely species conservation or the care of animals, by sanctuaries and individuals to whom sanctuaries \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nre-home animals, as a result of their abandonment, neglect, maltreatment or injury.  \nWe would support \na full ban in the keeping of primates as pets for private owners. \nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn relation to private ownership for conservation, only species for which a genuine conservation need has been recognised \nshould\n be able to be kept.  It is acknowledged that not all profess\nionally recognised controlled breeding programmes admit private \nindividuals.  Nevertheless, if private individuals were able to participate in such programmes, this could be a permitted purpose for private primate ownership.\ne)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCare for the Wild believes that\n all those keeping primates for a permitted purpose should follow a government \nendorsed\n detailed, speci\nes-appropriate code of practice that promotes a high level of care, coupled with a licensing or registration scheme. \nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.wildfutures.org/wp-content/blogs.\ndir/1/files/2009/09/Primates-as-pets_Is-there-a-case-for-regulation-2012_LR.pdf\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://endcap.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Report-Wild-Pets-in-the-E\nuropean-Union.pdf\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.cieh.org/jehr/default.aspx?id=41594\n&#xa0;\n"
