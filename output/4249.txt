[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;

[[[COMMENT ON AR5]]]&#xa0;

[[[1)]]] The IPCC wish us to believe that hundreds of climate model runs which do not match observations are still proof of warming.  In normal scientific protocols, in use since the 17th Century, if the hypothesis is not corroborated by observation and measurement, it is 

[[[WRONG]]].  In the latest IPCC Assessment, (AR5) the Summary for Policymakers claims 95% certainty that the warming since 1951 is human caused while having presented no evidence to support such a link.&#xa0;

[[[2)]]]

[[[.]]]  An inspection of the actual record shows that the global average temperature actually cooled between 1951 and 1978, so much so, that a number of scientists wrote to President Nixon warning of a coming Ice Age.  A reasonable assumption given that we live in an interglacial warm period.  These warm periods are episodic (approximately 15-20,000 years long, while glacial episodes last from 80 - 110,000 years.  There have been 5 cycles in the last 450,000 years. (see Petit et al 1999)  and in AR5 Working Group I it is stated, 

[[[There is ]]]

[[[high confidence ]]]

[[[that]]]

[[[ changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration play an important role in]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[glacial-interglacial cycles]]].   This assertion is a total contradiction of the peer reviewed literature which shows that CO2 is not involved in the warming process but follows as a result of degassing of melting ice.  Lags of 800 t0 1300 years have been reported by authors such as ( Fischer et al 1999, Monnin et al 2001, Mudelsee 2001 and Caillon 2003)  There is no mechanism to produce the CO2  in this strongly cyclical system and, more critically, how does it disappear with the onset of a new cooling trend?

[[[3).]]] Between1978 and 1997 the climate warmed correlative with rising atmospheric CO2 but ceased in 1997 and has remained stable since.  Therefore warming occurred in only 19 of 63 years which is only 30%., (an unlikely probability, in IPCC terminology)

[[[.]]]&#xa0;

[[[4).]]] The fact is that climate models have been unable to match observed climate variability because of the limitations of their assumptions, in particular, the supposedly dominant role of CO2.  It is well recognized by climatologists that CO2 without amplification or positive feedbacks can not warm the atmosphere in the manner proposed by IPCC scientists.   The failure of models to match actual observations is a clear indication that the model assumptions are wrong, and not that the heat is mysteriously hiding we know not where!  Furthermore, a model is only a hypothesis awaiting corroboration by measurement and observation

[[[.  As demonstrated]]]

[[[ments and observations show that the IPPC models are 97.5% wrong ]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Fig 1 After Spencer 2013, (http://www.drroyspencer.com/page/2/)  The figure documents that 97.5% of the models warm faster than the observations of the surface (green) and the troposphere (blue).  This demonstrates that there is no basis to claim 95% probability that warming is human caused.&#xa0;

[[[5]]]

[[[).]]]  It is commonplace to read that  atmospheric CO2 content is at its most elevated in the last 200,000 years, but it is usual to avoid the ‘inconvenient truth” that CO2 is at the lowest levels in the last 500million years and is  at minimum levels for a healthy biosphere.  A new detailed report (Idso 2013) details the benefits to the planet of elevated CO2 

[[['The results indicate that the annual total monetary value of this benefit grew from about $20 billion in 1961 to over $160 billion by 2011, amounting to ]]]

[[[a total sum of $3.5 trillion over the 50-year period 1961-2011.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[ Projecting the monetary value of this positive externality forward in time reveals it will likely bestow an additional $11.6 trillion on crop production between now and 2050']]] &#xa0;

[[[6]]]

[[[).]]] In the last 15,000 years, within the current interglacial, the climate has had eight episodes of warming and cooling, in recurrent cycles, all in general comparable to our modern warming period, but clearly lacking any influence by CO2.  The only feature that distinguishes the modern warming from eight previous cycles is that it is cooler. ( see Huang et al, 2000: Jiang et al 2007: Clegg et al 2010&#xa0;: Dietrich 2007&#xa0;: Fillipi et al 1999 and Yang et al 2009). Furthermore there are literally hundreds of peer reviewed articles describing the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Ages’ global occurrence (www.co2science.org) but in AR5, WGI, p.5-5 it states, 

[[[“]]]

[[[, while our current warming is neither unique,]]]

[[[ unusual or occurring at exceptional rates]]]

[[[ ]]]&#xa0;

[[[7]]]

[[[)]]]. There is abundant observational evidence, in published literature, to show that the two prior warm periods, the Roman Warm Period and the Medieval Warm Period, were as much as 1 º C warmer than our late 20th Century warming.  Since the modern warming initiates in the Little Ice Age as solar activity recovers from a 70 year hiatus in Sun spot activity then the warming into the 20th Century is certainly the result of increased solar activity.  There is no signal to indicate the point at which natural warming is supplemented by the effect of CO2.  Nor is there any signature which can identify anthropogenic versus natural warming.&#xa0;

[[[8]]]

[[[).]]] The focus by the IPCC on only the last 50 years of Climate variability is like trying to describe a large richly furnished drawing room through the keyhole.  What is most important is not what is in the AR5 report but what has been left out, or glibly avoided, most importantly, the history of the evolution of the Earth’s atmosphere, 5.4 billion years of geological history, which utterly contradicts a major role for CO2 as a climate driver.&#xa0;

[[[9]]]

[[[).]]] In the beginning the Earth’s atmosphere was anoxic and contained high volumes of Nitrogen, CO2, water vapour as well as molecules that are true pollutants like Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Hydrogen Sulphide (H2S), Methane (CH2), and Nitrogen Oxides (NOX).  Then how did this essentially toxic atmosphere come to support life and supply oxygen.  Why!  because of CO2 along with the evolution of prokaryotic bacteria.  In the early oceans 3.5 Billion years ago very primitive life forms, cyanobacteria, which were aquatic and photosynthetic, gradually became very abundant.  Photosynthesis allowed the organisms to utilise sunlight to digest CO2 converting it to cellulose and sugar molecules while releasing Oxygen (O2), the breath of life for the Animal Kingdom.  These organisms occurred in such massive quantities that they oxygenated the atmosphere to current oxygen levels.  Therefore, without CO2 and bacteria there would be no life on the planet. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[10]]]

[[[)]]]. Photosynthesis initiates a process of fixing and sequestering carbon which continues throughout geological history.  By the close of the Proterozoic extensive carbonate platforms and stromatolitic reefs are commonplace and have fixed thousands of gigatons of carbon.   Studies indicate that at 1.4Biillion years the Proterozoic atmosphere contained 10 to 200 times current levels of CO2.  That is to say 4,000 to 80,000 ppmv of CO2 (Kaufman&amp; Xiao,2003), (http//:www.nature.com/nature/journal/v425/n6955/abs/nature01902.html),  Although it will be argued that this is because of lower solar luminosity, this fails to account for the proliferation of life in the oceans, because, at these atmospheric concentrations of CO2, the IPCC are projecting dead oceans as a result of acidification.  Despite these very high atmospheric concentrations  of CO2 the Proterozoic oceans were teeming with microscopic life steadily advancing in complexity.&#xa0;

[[[11]]]

[[[).]]]

[[[ ]]]Berner and Kothvala (2001) through a series of studies beginning in 1991, 1994 and culminating with Geocarb III have documented the CO2 content of the atmosphere throughout the Phanerozoic.(see also Berner, 2006)  The study shows very high values throughout the Paleozoic, (541 – 250 million years ago) and the validity of the very high atmospheric CO2 values is corroborated from individual palaesol analyses.  In the Cambrian (541 – 485my) the CO2 levels were 17 – 25 times current levels, approximately 6,500 – 9600 ppmv.  The validity of such high atmospheric levels of CO2 is completely corroborated by the massive amounts of carbon that were fixed during this period.   Although the geography of the continents was quite different in the Cambrian most of  the ancient continental masses were drowned and fringed by massive carbonate platforms.  Minimum estimates of the carbon sequestered during the Cambrian yield 1,396,000,000,000,000 tonnes or 1,396, 000 gigatonnes.  It is not possible to reconcile the very high atmospheric CO2 levels during the Palaeozoic, some  15 – 17 times current  levels (5800 – 6500 ppmv) with the IPPC projections for doubling of CO2 (385 – 770ppmv),  especially given the complete lack of evidence of any adverse conditions in the oceans ( Veizer et al 1999) or on land, as evidenced by evolution of land plants in the Devonian.&#xa0;

[[[12]]]

[[[).]]]  According to IPPC forecasts for doubling of CO2, and climate model projections, global average temperatures in the Cambrian would be sufficiently untenable that the wonderful evolutionary explosion of phyla in the Cambrian, Burgess Shale, could never have occurred.  In all probability the planet would be as dead as Mars.  On the contrary Cambrian oceans enjoyed an environment not greatly different from our modern Oceans and a few exceptionally long lived groups which have almost identical anatomy and physiology to their Cambrian ancestors persist in our modern Oceans off Japan and Australia.  This is prima facie evidence that the elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 do not cause catastrophic warming or ocean acidification, nor is there any relationship between CO2 and climate in the last 500million years of Geological History (see Shaviv &amp; Veizer, 2003 also Veizer 2003). &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[13]]]

[[[)]]]

[[[.]]]The worst aspect of the IPCC report is their total disregard of the solar influence on climate.  In the very period where they are 95% confident of human influence we have 

[[[the most active solar cycles of the 20]]]

[[[ Century or the first half of the 20th.]]]

[[[ ]]]   From 1950 there are six cycles numbered 

[[[19]]] to 

[[[24]]].  The daily sun spot maximum at cycle

[[[22]]] and 

[[[23]]] from 

[[[155]]] to 

[[[115]]] and finally cycle

[[[ 24]]] is at a low of 

[[[65]]].  This pattern of solar variability has a 95% correlation with global average temperature and so there is no need to search for missing heat.&#xa0;&#xa0;Fig.2 Illustrates the Solar Sun Spot cycle from 1950 – 2013, (cycles 19 – 24), 19 on the left, and showing a significant decline in activity especially since 1997.&#xa0;

[[[14]]]

[[[)]]] The decline in solar activity through the last Sun Spot Cycles (Nos. 21, 22, 23 and 24) is shown in Fig.2, and this is consistent with the lack of warming in the last 15 years.  A weakening Cycle 23 lasted for 12.4 years and recorded 821 sun spot free days, a number not seen since the 19th Century.  The strong decline in sunspot number in Cycle24 suggests that we are now entering a solar minimum indicating the probability of cooling in the next decade.&#xa0;

[[[15). ]]]There is considerably more evidence both observational and experimental which confirms the Sun’s role in determining climate.  Henrik Svensmark has been a leading proponent of the solar influence on climate and in 1998 published an article to show that Earth's temperature follows more closely decadal variations in galactic cosmic ray flux and solar cycle length, than other solar activity parameters.  He then demonstrated a close relationship between cosmic ray flux and the development of low cloud (Marsh and Svensmark 2000)    Svensmark then demonstrated in his laboratory (The SKY study) that incoming cosmic rays entering a simulated atmosphere caused  the growth of clusters of molecules of the kind that build cloud condensation nuclei. These are specks of sulphuric acid on which cloud droplets form.(Svensmark et al 2007) &#xa0;

[[[1]]]

[[[6]]]).   In order to confirm these observations that more fully met the constraints of the atmosphere and the nature of cosmic particles a much more sophisticated experiment was undertaken at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN).  The results, released in 2011, have fully substantiated Svensmark’s hypothesis that incoming cosmic ray flux produces a steady production of new ionized particles (molecular clusters) that induce the nucleation of clouds.  (Kirby et al Nature 2011),  Therefore, in an exceptional demonstration of Scientific Method in climate science through observation, measurement and experiment Svensmark has shown that the Earth’s Climate results in large part from an interplay of the Sun’s activity and the incoming flux of cosmic rays from space, primarily the Milky Way Galaxy.   When the solar flux is weak cosmic bombardment is strong and low cloud is propagated causing cooling; with an active Sun, as we have had for most of the last Century, the increased solar flux deflects and reduces the cosmic ray influx. The weaker cosmic ray flux results in less cloud and a warmer climate.  This hypothesis explains in detail the climatic history of the Earth for the last 550 million years without resort to CO2 forcing.The failure of IPCC to acknowledge this groundbreaking research on cosmoclimatology is entirely political and without scientific merit.&#xa0;

[[[17]]]

[[[).]]] The IPCC have been accorded a cloak of infallibility second only to the Pope, but have not fulfilled the trust that they have been accorded.   Scientific objectivity and integrity have been sacrificed to achieve political goals almost at any cost, including blocking publication, lobbying editors, interfering with peer review and selective use of data.  Lead authors are not obligated to address critical comment and for the most part critical reviews are ignored. &#xa0;

[[[18]]]

[[[).]]] The AR5 report has provided no evidence on which policy decisions can be based.  The so called “ hiatus” is simply a euphemism to avoid admitting that the IPCC projections are invalid.  While it is evident that the current solar minimum is very likely a precursor of continued cooling.  The IPCC process has demonstrated a propensity to use data selectively and manipulate it in order to exaggerate their claims.  They have indulged in fearmongering extensively in exaggerating claims of melting ice caps, rising sea level and increasing severe weather floods, droughts and tropical storms&#xa0;
