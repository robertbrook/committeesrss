"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by Sir Alan Haselhurst MP, Chair of the Administration Committee&#xa0;Thank you for your letter dated 16 December regarding your Committee's \ninquiry into the impact of the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act 2011 and how it \nmay affect the work of select committees in the year before the general \nelection.\nAs you will be aware, the Administration Committee does not scrutinise \nlegislation or Government policy. Our remit is to examine the services \nprovided by and for Members and visitors to Parliament by the House of \nCommons. The Committee's programme of work is therefore less affected by \nthe clear timetabling of the next general election than other departmental \nselect committees who may undertake pre-legislative scrutiny.\nHowever, certainty about the date of the next general election is very \nwelcome in terms of timetabling the Committee's business and helping the \nHouse prepare effectively for dissolution and ensure suitable new induction \narrangements for new Members in 2015. The Committee examined this \nmatter in some detail in its recent report, \nFirst Weeks at Westminster: \ninduction arrangements for new Members in 2015, \nwhich you may be \ninterested to consult.\n&#xa0;19 December 2013&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
