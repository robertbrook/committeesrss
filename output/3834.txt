[[[Supplementary evidence from the Ministry of Justice]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Evidence session follow-up]]]&#xa0;Following the oral evidence session on 5 November I am pleased to provide additional information on the following topics as requested by the Committee. &#xa0;&#xa0;I have spoken to colleagues in Guernsey and the Department for Transport (DfT) and it is apparent that consultation on this issue is ongoing. In recent years the Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies have become increasingly interested in the establishment of aircraft registers, or expanding existing aircraft registers, to target the offshore market.&#xa0; While the DfT had previously advised the Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies on what is required if they run offshore registers, in light of increasing interest they decided that they should make a definitive statement of the UK’s policy in this area.&#xa0; The Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies were fully consulted during the development of this policy. The consultation with the Crown Dependencies was conducted through their Directors of Civil Aviation.&#xa0; &#xa0;Earlier this year Guernsey obtained quotes for insurance to meet the costs of investigating accidents involving aircraft on their register in circumstances where the obligation to investigate would fall to the state of registry of the aircraft.&#xa0; Such costs arise mainly from the need to recover wreckage from the high seas.&#xa0; Guernsey also sought quotes for insurance against the costs of investigating accidents occurring in Guernsey and its territorial waters.&#xa0; The insurance quotes they received in respect of accidents involving aircraft on the Guernsey register were reasonable, but those for accidents occurring within Guernsey were prohibitively expensive.&#xa0;Guernsey then queried whether the UK was expecting them to pay for the costs of investigating accidents in Guernsey.&#xa0; DfT advised them that the new Government policy only covered accidents involving aircraft on the registers of the Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies.&#xa0; However, DfT also stated that it seemed reasonable for such costs to be met by Guernsey rather than the UK taxpayer. The UK Air Accident’s Investigation Branch is legally responsible for carry out the investigations under UK legislation extended to Guernsey, there does not appear to be any agreement on who should meet wreckage recovery or other costs arising from an accident in Guernsey.&#xa0;However, following further consideration and consultation with the Crown Dependencies, DfT now consider that it would be unreasonable to expect an Overseas Territory or Crown Dependency to pick up the (potentially very high) costs of investigating an accident in their waters. Given the very low likelihood of such an event and the high premiums, DfT’s view is that it would be unreasonable for the Islands to purchase insurance. DfT are therefore exploring the option of accepting responsibility for these costs in the unlikely event of an accident occurring within the territorial waters of an Overseas Territory or Crown Dependency. &#xa0;&#xa0;We would expect Government Departments and the Crown Dependencies to work together to resolve any disagreements as to issues between themselves. Where an internal resolution is not possible, MoJ officials are able to act as a point of reference on constitutional issues. We do recognise that there are times where external support is necessary to resolve the issue and we deal with these on a case by case basis to ensure that the most appropriate part of the UK Government is able to offer assistance. &#xa0;The Cabinet Office has never been the only port of call for dealing with constitutional issues.  However, we have in the past sought the views of the Cabinet Office European lawyers on issues regarding the interpretation of EU Law. There may be times when other legal input is more appropriate.&#xa0;The issue referred to the Committee by officials in Guernsey concerns whether Customs and Excise legislation has preserved certain historic functions in relation to the Channel Islands, and if so whether this would provide a basis for a current data-sharing “gateway”.  In this specific instance referred to by Guernsey we have considered, with Cabinet Office and other officials, the best way of obtaining clarification on the legal position and – more importantly – how to resolve the issue. As this particular matter concerns the interpretation of a piece of HMRC legislation, we consider that the best approach to resolving the issue is for MoJ officials to continue to engage with HMRC and Guernsey and facilitate discussions between them.&#xa0;&#xa0;The MoJ’s Crown Dependencies team consists of four policy officials. The team is supplemented by three lawyers who work on the Crown Dependencies and other policy areas. &#xa0;If there are any other areas on which you would like further information, please do get in touch. &#xa0;&#xa0;
