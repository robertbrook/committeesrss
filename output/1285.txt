[[[Grange-over-Sands Town ]]]

[[[Council (TIC 013)]]]&#xa0;Grange over Sands is a small town in the south of Cumbria, situated on the Kent Estuary.  While a thriving place to live, in the last census the inhabitants numbered four thousand plus and the figures showed that the local population was slanted towards an older demographic, though this group in no way reflects the total population of the town.&#xa0;The town grew from a series of very small settlements as the railway brought tourists and those seeking a clean, healthy place to reside.  Grange over Sands still boasts a gentle climate, amazing local shops and a slower pace of life and this continues to encourage both tourists and retirees to the town.  These two groups mean that Grange over Sands has a particular need for reliable, regular and accessible local public transport on a year round basis.&#xa0;Grange over Sands, while not isolated, is surrounded by small villages which very much rely on the limited amount of public transport available.  At present, the town is quite well served by both rail and bus services during the week and on Saturdays, though a wider range of destinations might be desirable.  There is an (approximate) hourly service on both bus and rail services during the day, but a less frequent service in the evening.  On Sundays the service for both bus and rail travel is very limited, making it impossible, for example, to travel to and from entertainment in Kendal, Barrow or Lancaster, or indeed for any other purpose. &#xa0;Despite some shortcomings, the X6 bus service (from Barrow to Kendal via Grange over Sands and Ulverston) could be described as a well-used lifeline for the people of the Furness peninsula.  This service however, would never have happened without quite considerable investment from Cumbria County Council to get the route up and running and at the point it is today, where it is popular enough to continue without a subsidy. This really shows what both farsightedness and long term investment can achieve. &#xa0;At present there is also a local ‘circular’ bus service on weekdays and Saturdays which services the local villages and outlying settlements.  There is no evening service on this route and no Sunday or Bank Holiday service, despite this being a busy tourist destination.  There is also a very well-used, but intermittent, weekday service from Cartmel via some of the villages to Grange and ultimately to Kendal.  This bus links in with school services and also serves the village of Levens, between Grange over Sands and Kendal.  It would be very vulnerable to loss should the schools franchise change. &#xa0;The bus is often very full and frequently is standing only when it reaches the village of Levens, not ideal when many of the users are older people.&#xa0;&#xa0;All settlements along the Furness peninsula, whether large or small, are concerned at the potential threat to through rail services to and from Manchester airport when electrification of the Preston to Manchester line begins.  A series of passenger number and destination surveys have been, and are being, carried out by FLAG (Furness Line Action Group) and FLCRP (Furness Line Community Rail Partnership) to ascertain current figures for through journeys beginning before or ending beyond Lancaster.  &#xa0;With the recent announcement of the proposed electrification of the Windermere Line, as a busy tourist destination and home of large companies such as BAE Systems and GlaxoSmithKline, any cut in through trains to the Furness Line could have a seriously significant detrimental effect upon the financial wellbeing of many communities in the area as well as making the whole peninsula less attractive to inward investment.  &#xa0;It is vital that not only are through trains not lost but that the Furness Line is electrified along with other areas of the North West. &#xa0;It is sometimes the case that cyclists arriving at local stations find insufficient space for bicycles on the trains and due to the current lack of extra rolling stock.  This situation is unlikely to improve in the near future when there is already a lack of passenger accommodation.  This seriously undermines any chance of sustainable (‘green’) tourism.&#xa0;Those members of our community who have a physical infirmity already find it difficult to travel by train due to the lack of facilities such as lifts and also a lack of staff at unmanned railway stations.  Travelling by bus is not much easier, although the Grange Circular (service 532) which services areas of Grange over Sands and outlying villages is a low floor vehicle with wheelchair access and space.  &#xa0;The X6 service, however, which gives access to the larger towns of Kendal, Ulverston and Barrow and the 530 service from Cartmel to Kendal are both run by Stagecoach and cannot be relied upon to always have easy access or space for a wheelchair. &#xa0;Young families with pushchairs also find difficulty in using these services.  For a tourist destination these services are also often lacking in adequate luggage space. &#xa0;While there are a number of community transport schemes operating in Cumbria, should local public transport services deteriorate, these could be better developed locally and Grange over Sands should probably become a focus for such services in the Cartmel peninsula. &#xa0;During the school summer holidays local visitor attractions have clubbed together to finance a free local bus linking a variety of places to visit which are difficult to access without a personal vehicle.  This is still in a trial period and probably needs to bed in and be further advertised before a decision could be taken as to whether it is a success and should be repeated in future years. &#xa0;While many local older residents in the hilly Cartmel peninsula already rely on taxis to take them for shopping and medical appointments, the distances between many of the smaller settlements make taxi use prohibitively expensive, especially over the long distances to Kendal, Barrow and Lancaster. &#xa0;The main challenges in retaining or even improving local public transport services to scattered communities are cost and usage numbers.  When travelling locally by bus on weekdays it becomes obvious that the vast majority of passengers are older citizens, many of whom use a bus pass.  Should the financing of these passes ever be altered or the subsidy withdrawn altogether, then local services would be very badly hit financially.&#xa0;Local students also use these services to access further education at Barrow and Kendal and there are various schemes available for young people to have reduced fares on buses at other times. &#xa0;There are many factors why all communities need good, affordable, regular public transport services which are accessible to all.  A worrying point in this issue is the fact that lack of local transport services limits the social options of residents without personal transport.  This can lead to isolation and depression, particularly in the elderly and or those living alone.  A lack of local transport can also have a very detrimental effect on the local economy, particularly when potential customers from outlying areas are unable to access local shops and businesses.  &#xa0;Should the potential number of new homes designated by Government for the area become reality, then keeping public transport viable becomes even more crucial if further vehicles are not to be added to the already inadequate road system.  &#xa0;With a dearth of convenient and affordable public transport services it is inevitable that people will be forced to use personal transport, whether it be car, motorbike or bicycle, thus exacerbating the already enormous problems on congested local roads. &#xa0;This in itself will lead to increasing numbers of accidents involving both vehicles and pedestrians.  It also makes even worse the pedestrian experience for those using the already intimidating busy and fume filled pavements.&#xa0;August 2013
