[normal]Written evidence submitted by Dr Thomas Lundberg[bold], University of Glasgow[bold] (DWB 10)[bold]Summary:
[normal]With regard to the electoral arrangements for the National Assembly for Wales, I strongly support restoration of the right for candidates to stand for election both in constituencies and on regional lists simultaneously (‘dual candidacy’) because this 
[normal]woul
[normal]d promote more electoral competition at the constituency level, helping voters both at election time and between elections, with the greater likelihood of the 
[normal]‘
[normal]shadowing
[normal]’
[normal] of constituency Assembly Members by their regional counterparts who hope to seek elec
[normal]tion locally; it would also mean that parties would be more likely to get their strongest candidates elected, 
[normal]which would strengthen the democratic process; and it
[normal] 
[normal]is the norm in mixed-member proportional (MMP
[normal] – the term used internationally by most politi
[normal]cal scientists to describe what the British government calls the additional member system
[normal]) electoral systems
[normal] elsewhere
[normal] in the world. 
[normal]Maintaining
[normal] the ban 
[normal]goes against the logic of proportional representation 
[normal](PR) 
[normal]and would perpetuate what appeared to be a p
[normal]artisan rigging of the Assembly’s electoral system
[normal].
[normal]1. 
[normal]The 
[normal]Labour Party
[normal], in general,
[normal] 
[normal]opposes dual candidacy
[normal] in MMP elections (used for the Scottish Parliament, National Assembly for Wales, and London Assembly)
[normal], with claims that it is undemocratic for candi
[normal]dates who were
[normal], in the 
[normal]terminology
[normal] of some in the party
[normal],
[normal] ‘rejected’ 
[normal]by voters 
[normal]in constituency races 
[normal]only 
[normal]to 
[normal]enter
[normal] an assembly or parliament through the ‘back door’ of the 
[normal]regional 
[normal]party list. Former Welsh Secretary Peter Hain was so opposed to dual candida
[normal]cy that he 
[normal]led the effort to have
[normal] the practice banned for Assembly elections (from 2007), despite the fact that nearly all Labour constituency candidates in the previous (2003) elections were also party list candidates. At the most recent elections
[normal] in 2011
[normal], dual candidacy remained
[normal] banned in Wales, but not i
[normal]n Scotland, where 19% of Labour’
[normal]s nominees were dual candidates, compared to 78% for the Scottish National Party (SNP), 86% for the Conservatives, an
[normal]d 52% for the Liberal Democrats.
[normal]2. 
[normal]Critics 
[normal]of the ban 
[normal]pointed out the partisan appearance of the 
[normal]action
[normal]. The Electoral Commission noted this problem in its 2005 statement opposing the
[normal] proposal
[normal], where it rejected Labour’s argument
[normal] that the 
[normal]public opposed dual candidacy because it had 
[normal]found no evidence of such 
[normal]opposition. 
[normal]In the 2006 debate over this issue, 
[normal]Conservative M
[normal]embers of the House of Commons also pointed out the appearance of 
[normal]Labour 
[normal]partisanship, noting that
[normal] because of Labour’s advantage in Welsh constituencies,
[normal] 
[normal]o
[normal]the
[normal]r
[normal] parties
[normal] would be more likely to nominate weaker candidates in strong Labour areas if dual candidacy were banned
[normal] because the regional list route would probably be safer
[normal]. While the result since the ban 
[normal]was enacted 
[normal]is hard to test 
[normal]because many other factors are invo
[normal]lved in 
[normal]elections
[normal] (‘correlation is not causation’
[normal], as social scientists would say
[normal])
[normal], the ban c
[normal]ould 
[normal]have mad
[normal]e constituency contests less competitive and
[normal], therefore,
[normal] 
[normal]might
[normal] have been 
[normal]bad for voters.
[normal] 
[normal]3. My research into the constituency role of MMP-elected rep
[normal]resentatives (and relations between them) shows that 
[normal]there have been tensions between constituency- and list-elected members of the National Assembly for Wales and the Scottish Parliament, and that the situation in the UK is worse than the situation in Ger
[normal]many, where the modern form of MMP originated. 
[normal]Chapter 6 of my 2007 book 
[normal](see below) 
[normal]recounts the frustration many constituency representatives felt when encountering ‘shadowing’ by list-elected representatives who sought to raise their profile locally, re
[normal]sponding to the electoral incentive provided by MMP and dual candidacy – representatives elected via their party’s regional list wo
[normal]uld focus constituency service o
[normal]n a geographical constituency in which they planned to seek 
[normal]their party’s nomination at the n
[normal]ext election. 
[normal]In the early years of devolution, most 
[normal]Welsh and Scottish constituency-elected representatives were from
[normal] the Labour Party facing regional list-elected representatives from other parties
[normal], so there is a partisan dimension to the tensions. 
[normal]While
[normal] this
[normal] competitive situation
[normal] may have been uncomfortable for representatives elected in constituencies, it focused more attention on constituents in some constituencies previously seen as safe, so could have been good for 
[normal]those 
[normal]constituents’ interests.
[normal]4. 
[normal]F
[normal]or parties, there 
[normal]are problems associated with banning dual candidacy – they 
[normal]may
[normal] fail to elect their strongest c
[normal]andidates, resulting in a weakening of the democratic process. In Wales, the 2011 election saw the Conservative leader fail to win a regional li
[normal]st seat due to the unexpectedly strong performance of his party’s constituency candidates in that region. 
[normal]In Scotland, many high profile 
[normal]Labour candidates did not partake of dual candidacy and lost their constituency seats
[normal] in 2011
[normal], so were not able to re-e
[normal]nter the Scottish Parliament. Some have become assistants to novice candidates who did win (and were presumably not expected to do so). Scottish Labour went from 53 constituency and 3 list members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) in the first (1999) elect
[normal]ion to 15 constituen
[normal]cy and 22 list in 2011. The loss
[normal] of so many experienced Labour MSPs in the last election makes it more difficult for the opposition to the SNP majority government (the party won 69 of the 129 seats) to scrutinise 
[normal]it
[normal] effectively.
[normal] 
[normal]5. 
[normal]MMP
[normal] is a form of 
[normal]PR
[normal], so the winner-take-all element derived from 
[normal]constituency
[normal] contests can, for many people, b
[normal]e a confusing holdover from the
[normal] ‘first-past-the-post’ system. It is understandable that people might find it difficult to accept the apparent resurrection of candidates who lose 
[normal]constituency
[normal] contests
[normal], and part of the Labour Party’s opposition to dual candidacy probably 
[normal]comes
[normal] from a
[normal] high
[normal]ly
[normal] majoritarian understanding of democracy
[normal]. 
[normal]Such a 
[normal]zero-sum 
[normal]view
[normal],
[normal] however, is incompatible with the 
[normal]positive
[normal]-
[normal]sum 
[normal]logic of 
[normal]PR
[normal].
[normal] MMP is about a larger contest that takes place across 
[normal]the 
[normal]electoral regions 
[normal]of
[normal] Wales
[normal] in which 
[normal]a party’s overall (constituency plus
[normal] regional)
[normal] 
[normal]seat allocation is determined
[normal], more or less,
[normal] by
[normal] 
[normal]its
[normal] party vote
[normal] because of the (roughly) compensatory linkage between the constituency and regional tiers of seats
[normal]. The 
[normal]constituency
[normal] contests determine who is the ‘local’ 
[normal]Assembly Member (
[normal]AM
[normal])
[normal], thoug
[normal]h list 
[normal]AMs
[normal] 
[normal]typically
[normal] undertake a constituency role, and this can be important for those voters who were unsuccessful in electing their choice of a 
[normal]constituency 
[normal]candidate as a means of linking them into the political system.
[normal] 
[normal]6. 
[normal]Because dual candidacy is
[normal] a
[normal] 
[normal]typical 
[normal]feature 
[normal]of MMP systems (as well as 
[normal]most
[normal] mixed-member majoritarian 
[normal](MMM) systems, in which constituency and regional or national list seat tiers are not linked and PR
[normal] overall 
[normal]is not achieved)
[normal], and because 
[normal]the dual candidacy ban for 
[normal]Welsh Assembly el
[normal]ections was not in place at the outset, nor was it enacted for Scottish Parliamen
[normal]t or London Assembly elections, I was shocked when the 
[normal]British
[normal] government enacted the ban. 
[normal]While I have studied electoral systems for years, and am familiar with other countri
[normal]es’ experiences 
[normal]of
[normal] the manipulation of these systems for partisan advantage, I would never have expected a British government to carry out what appeared to be such a blatantly partisan attempt to rig an electoral system. Perhaps I 
[normal]was
[normal] naïve, having gr
[normal]own u
[normal]p in the United States believing British democracy to be of a higher calibre than this. For those electoral systems experts looking at Britain from outside, noting that the few countries 
[normal]with
[normal] mixed-membe
[normal]r systems 
[normal]that ban
[normal] dual candidacy include the less-th
[normal]an-democratic Ukraine and
[normal] 
[normal]Thailand
[normal] (among a few others)
[normal], the inclusion of Wal
[normal]es in this group is disturbing.
[normal]7. In Germany, longstanding user of MMP, dual candidacy is not controversial. 
[normal]While there was some controversy, 
[normal]New Zealand has recently examined 
[normal]dual candidacy 
[normal]and has chosen to retain
[normal] it
[normal]. I hope the National Assembly for Wales will revert to 
[normal]its
[normal] former situation of allowing dual candidacy. While it may be outside the remit of this committee
[normal]’s enquiry
[normal], I 
[normal]would also recommend increasing the size of 
[normal]the Assembly to 80 by simply adding another 20 regional members
[normal] (four more to each of the five existing electoral regions)
[normal]. This would increase the 
[normal]proportionality of election results and make the Assembly more representative of the 
[normal]voters
[normal] of Wales.
