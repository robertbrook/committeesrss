Written evidence from Men’s Health Expert Policy Group (LTC 80)default&#xa0;
defaultT
defaulthe Men’s Health Expert Policy Group
default is 
defaulta multi-disciplinary group of leading primary and secondary care clinicians, charities and advocacy groups with specialist interests in men’s health, endocrinology, cardiovascular disease, and sexual health.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Group would like to take this opportunity to respond to the 
defaultHealth Select Committee’s inquiry examining how the NHS in England can improve the care for people with long-term conditions, particularly people suffering from diabetes.
default 
defaultThere is strong evidence of the links between c
defaultommon men’s health problems, such as erectile dysfunction (ED) and testosterone deficiency syndrome (TDS), 
defaultand 
defaultmore serious long-term cond
defaultitions such as type-2 diabetes.
default 
defaultI
defaultt is important therefore that the Committee considers 
defaultthese
default as part of its inquiry.
default 
defaultOur recommendations to the Committee are in bold.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs the Committee will be aware, ED
default is 
defaultthe consistent inability to get or maintain an erection during sexual intercourse
default and is 
defaultthought to affect more than one in ten men
default.
default 
defaultOn the other hand, 
defaultTDS is estimated to affect o
defaultne in ten men between the ages of 20 and 79
default 
defaultand is a condition where the body does not produce enough of the hormone testosterone.
default 
defaultAlthough both conditions can be treated, there is 
defaultsignificant 
defaultvariation in the quality of services being provided and commissioned for these conditions 
defaultin England
default,
default 
defaultwhich can 
defaultresults in 
defaultmissed diagnosis and 
defaultfailure to treat
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn March 2013, the Department of Health published its sexual health policy document, 
defaultA Framework for Sexual Health Improvement in England
default, and the accompanying commissioning guidance for local authorities, 
defaultCommissioning Sexual Health Services and Interventions: Best Practice Guidance for Local Authorities
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Framework recognises that erectile dysfunction (ED) is “a marker for underlying CVD [cardiovascular disease] and health professionals should be alert to this issue, which provides an early opportunity to treat the risks of CVD as well as addressing erectile dysfunction” .
default 
defaultThe Group welcomes this inclusion within the Framework as 
defaulta
defaultn
default 
defaultacknowledgement 
defaultof the 
defaultgrowing body of evidence to demonstrate that common men’s health conditions can be indicators of an elevated risk of developing more serious cardiovascular conditions – including type-2 diabetes
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, despite recognition of this, both the Framework and the subsequent guidance fail to provide clarity about where responsibilities lie for the commissioning of men’s health services.
default 
defaultThis is with the exception of vasectomy.
default 
defaultThe documents also provide no information about how the commissioning of specific men’s health services, including for managing ED and TDS, will be shared between local authorities, clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) and NHS England
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultGiven the linkages between men’s health conditions and more serious long-term conditions, the Committee should recommend that the Department of Health, with NHS England and Public Health England, provide further clarity about where responsibility for men’s health sits to ensure patients have a joined-up experience of care and promote earlier diagnosisdefault.default&#xa0;
defaultEarly complications of type 2 diabetes include ED and TDS, and can often be identified before a man is given a diagnosis of the condition.
default 
defaultFor example, by the time people with type 2 diabetes are diagnosed, it is estimated that half are already showing signs of complications of their disease
default 
defaultwhich, for men, could include erectile problems.
default 
defaultFurthermore, it has been estimated that complications may appear five to six years before they have a diagnosis of the underlying disease
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Committee shoulddefault recommend that gdefaultovernment, the NHS and healthcare professionals consider ED and TDS as an important warning sign for diabetes before more serious complications arise.default defaultFurthermore, it is important that GPs ask men with diabetes about ED as this is a serious consequence of the condition and can also be a symptom of TDS.defaultThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guideline for th
defaulte management of type 2 diabetes
default identifies ED as a side-effect of diabetes in men
default.
default 
defaultThe guideline outlines that clinicians should:
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is important that healthcare professionals follow these guidelines and local health bodies monitor its implementation.
default&#xa0;
defaultBuilding on this guidance, the Group has welcomed the inclusion of two new indicators to the Quality Outcomes Framework for 2013/14 of relevance to ED and diabetes
default.
default 
defaultThese indicators are aimed at incentivising GPs to ask male patients with diabetes about ED and the treatment options for ED.
default 
defaultThe inclusion of these indicators represents an important step in ensuring men’s health issues are appropriately prioritised in primary care. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, with one in five GPs admitting that they are not comfortable talking to men about sexual health issues
default,
default further support needs to be made available to ensure primary care practitioners have the training and resources to discuss these important issues
default, and that men are having equal access to the care and support they need
default.
default 
defaultThe Committee should recommend that Public Health England work with the Royal College of General Practitioners to take this agenda forward as part of the wider defaultMaking every contact countdefault initiative.default&#xa0;
defaultFurthermore, the Cardiovascular Disease Outcomes Strategy commits NHS England to work with stakeholders 
default“to identify how to incentivise and support primary care consistently to provide good management of people with or at risk of CVD”,
default including from relevant QOF indicators
default.
default 
defaultThe Group supports this commitment.
default 
defaultThe Committee should recommend that, as part of this work, NHS England looks at how the QOF indicators for ED and diabetes are being implemented and identifies areas where these can be improved upon.default&#xa0;
