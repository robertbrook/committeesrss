default6.  The Government favours a stan
defaultdard medical report form for use in all claims, but
defaultthis will inevitably mean that reporting doctors would have to confine their  remarks to a standard template or a drop-box option which will limit the amount of     information provided.
default&#xa0;
default7.  
default              
defaultLack of det
defaultail will not advance the Government’s objective of address
defaulting 
defaultfraud. The 
defaultr
defaulteporting expert must be free to describe in his own words the claimant’s account 
defaulto
defaultf his injuries, how they affected him and for how long. There must also be an
default 
defaultopportunity
default 
defaultfor the expert to provide 
defaulthis 
defaultimpressions
default 
defaultof the claimant and the account he has provided.
default&#xa0;
default8.  The Government also favours a system in which the medical report is sent 
defaultsimultaneously
default to the claimant and defendant. This is completely inappropriate as medi
defaultcal reports contain confidential medical information
default,
default requir
defaulting
default the individual’s informed consent
default 
defaultbefore being passed to a third party.
default&#xa0;
defaultPre-medical offersdefault&#xa0;
default9.   A
defaultPIL has argued from the outset that offers of compensation made to claimants without a 
defaultmedical report should be banned
default, and we were therefore enormously encouraged by the comments of the Transport Select Committee and the Government in relation to this
default. The APIL research 
defaultreferred to in paragraph 5 
defaultfound that half of respondents questioned be
defaultlieved that this practice 
defaultis in itself fraudulent. We were  encouraged, therefore, to hear from the Association of British Insurers recently that “the industry is willing to consider stopping pre-med offers…”
default 
default&#xa0;
default10.
default              
defaultIt is unfortunate that this sentiment 
defaultwas conditional on other developments, but still represents welcome progress, particularly when some in the industry have expressed their disquiet publicly about the practice
default.
default&#xa0;
default11. I
defaultt is

defaulthis practice should be banned by means of legislation

default, 
default in dialogue
default with the Government
default on necessary changes
default.
default&#xa0;
default12. 
defaultA
default medical report should not be required at the very beginning of the claim process
default as a
default requirement to produce a medical report at the outset would generate unnecessary costs and delays in claims which do not proceed.   
default 
default&#xa0;
default13. O
defaultnce
default an improved system of med
defaultical reporting 
defaulthas been
default developed, it must be used. 
default 
defaultWhile the practice of pre-medical offers persists in whiplash cases, fraud can continue undetected. To stop fraud, pre-medical offers must be banned, and the quality of medical reporting must be higher –
default the two will work in tandem.
default&#xa0;
default14. 
defaultThird party capture is another route by which fraud can take place undetected. Insurers should also commit to obtaining medical evidence
default if
default dealing with people direct.
default Injured people must be protected from 
defaultthe

defaulth do take place when insurers deal with the

defaultthe exertion of

defaultC
defaultlaimant lawyers 
defaultcan
default be gatekeepers against people who try to make fraudulent claims if relevant information held by the insurance industry 
defaultis
default made available to 
defaultthem
default. 
defaultClaimant solicitors could be of 
defaultreal 
defaultvalue in the fight against fraud if they  have access to the number and 
defaulttype of accidents 
defaultin which 
defaulta potential client has been involved, and 
defaultinformation about 
defaultpersonal injury claims arising from them.
default This information is currently held by insurers
default and there is no logical disadvantage to it being made available to claimant soli
defaultcitor
defaults
default.
default The date any previous injur
defaulty was
default 
defaultsustained would also be very helpful as, if the case is genuine, this information could assist medical professionals to provide the best treatment for patient
defaults
default. 
defaultWe are greatly encouraged
default to learn 
defaultthat discussions
default about 
defaultthis are ongoing in the insurance industry
default and that information may become available in due course
default.
default Ideally, this data would need to be available at the time of implementation of the new medical reporting system.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultSmall Claims Court Limitdefault&#xa0;
default16. 
defaultThe announcement that there would be no change to the small claims court limit at this 
defaulttime
default was very much welcomed by AP
defaultIL. T
defaulthe small claims court was not designed for people who represent themselves in personal injury cases; raising the limit would have h
defaultad no impact on fraud whatsoever, 
defaultand this was, after all, 
defaulta 
defaultkey
default 
defaultpurpose 
defaultof the Government’s consultation; it would have had an enormous 
defaultand negative 
defaultimpact on the courts, which would have been overwhelmed by litigants in person who would have struggled to
default understand the court system; and it would have led to another explosion of spam calls and texts from claims management companies who would have exploited the situation of people who would no longer be able to afford legal representation.
default A
defaultn increase
default in th
defaulte limit would
default, therefore,
default 
defaulthave 
defaultbe
defaulten
default wholly counterproductive
default.
default&#xa0;
default17. 
defaultIt is to be hoped that proposals can now be developed which will assist all concerned in ensuring fair compensation for those 
defaultinjured people
default, while working to eradicate fraudulent
default and exa

defaulterated claims.
