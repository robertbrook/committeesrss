[[[Geoff Eyre â€“ Written evidence]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Can you send my concerns to the offroading committee.&#xa0;I enclose photos of damage caused and the Peak National Park seem to allow is to continue?&#xa0;I farm an upland area and the tracks to the moor was a green lane and one could drive an escort van around when visiting stock. (only 15 years ago) now even a hard walk&#xa0;The routes used are basically drover routes and now 4x4 s quad bikes and trials bikes come in their 100s and are wrecking the place.&#xa0;The Planning committee promised a TRO once they had the powers to close and now thats years ago.&#xa0;Please get the area around Brough and Shatton as restricted (farm and access to land only)&#xa0;I have had to stop complaining as I have seen retaliation by offroaders knocking my walls down, I take photos and am often chased by trespassing offenders (a dodgy job instructed by the Police ? ) , as a farmer if we did any land damage it would effect our single farm payment on environmental reasons.&#xa0;The Planning authority should plan and find sites for the offroaders to play on, good sites could become a business and then taxed rather than the 85 k the DCC have just paid out to repair (just sections)&#xa0;9 September 13&#xa0;&#xa0;
