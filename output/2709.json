"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Micropower CouncilExecutive Summary\n1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe welcome the Environment\nal\n Audit Committee’s decision to launch this inquiry at such an important point in the development of regulations for the new build sector.\n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Housing Standards Review proposal to repeal the Planning and Energy Act will remove the \nonly policy tool explicitly incentivising on-site renewables in new homes. This tool must remain available to local authorities at least until Building Regulations are sufficiently strong to drive uptake of on-site low carbon and renewable energy production in new homes. In addition, the Code for Sustainable Ho\nmes should also remain available until Building Regulations are strengthened.\n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are concerned that the level set for Part L Building Regulations of just 6% CO2 reduction for new homes does not set an ambitious enough target and drive the market in this sector. \n4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNot\n enough evidence has\n been explored about the cost\n of \nbuilding new energy efficient homes and the\n \nfact that the \ncost to retrofit homes \nto a higher efficiency standard is greater than at new build. A higher standard of energy efficient new build is cheaper for the economy overall than building lower cost housing because of the overall energy savings achieved, locked in for the lifetime of the building.\nAbout the Micropower Council\n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Micropower Council represents companies and organisations active in the micro-generation sector and campaigns on behalf of its members for a genuine mass market for small scale, low and zero carbon electricity and heat generating technologies. Micropower Council members include manufacturers and installers of microgeneration technologies as well as energy suppliers and other trade associations active in the sector. \n6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor more information on any of the responses in this document or on the Micropower Council, please contact Anna Livesey: anna.livesey@micropower.co.uk. Response\nSummary\n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn July 2013\n, \na decision was announced to adopt only a 6% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to the 2010 standard under Part L Building Regulations, rather than \nthe ‘\nhalfway\n’\n to zero carbons target. This approach is not ambitious enough \nand does \nnot impose strict enough carbon reduction targets to incentivise the integration of on-site renewables (such as solar energy systems, heat pumps and biomass boilers) into new properties.\n8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs a result of this decision, t\nhe Plannin\ng and Energy Act's ‘Merton Rule’\n is the only policy tool explicitly incentivising on-site renewables in new home\ns. It\n must remain available to local authorities at \nthe very \nleast until Building Regulations are sufficiently strong to drive uptake of on-site low carbon and renewable energy production in new homes (which will not be befor\ne 2016 at the earliest). It is also still\n important \nto\n driv\ne\n higher energy efficiency standards as well \nas low carbon and renewable technologies in non-residential buildings, \nand\n some of this is already incentivised through FITs and the RHI.\n9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOne of the main issues is that e\nnergy efficiency measures\n and on-site renewables\n are more cost effective to install at construction than retrofit and not driving uptake in new homes will create a legacy of buildings that need to be brought up to standard. Initiatives such as the Green Deal will need to find budget to deal with this legacy.\n10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBuilding of new homes is seen as\n \nimpor\ntant to improve the economy. However, building more homes to a higher energy efficiency standard makes more sense economically. The lower running costs of these buildings and therefore savings to consumers will be locked-in creating an overall net benefit. A benefit that outweighs costs and is cheaper than paying to achieve carbon reduction and renewables targets through bills or taxation.\n11.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMerton Borough Council (on whose initiative the Planning and Energy Act was based) estimate that if applied nationally the Act could save 160,000 tonnes of CO2 annually and contribute to an annual total renewable energy infrastructure industry of £1,125,000,000. Figures that should not be overlooked when considering the repeal of this important Act.\n12.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Code for Sustainable Homes also provides a set of graduated standards for energy and environmental performance that exceed the minimum levels in Building Regulations.\n&#xa0;\nDecision making process\n13.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have heard anecdotal evidence that the decision making process regarding the repeal of the Act was not robust. A Communities and Local Government \ntask group was set up\n,\n with \nrepresentatives \nfrom across industry\n,\n to develop the proposals for the Housing Standards Review. \nThe group met three times\n,\n and at the final meeting in February 2013 the group was\n unable to \nreach any meaningful conclusions. Therefore not all members of this group were supportive of the\n final proposal to abol\nish the Planning and Energy Act and consideration was not taken for the views of all those involved in the group. \nImpact on existing commitments \n14.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn this year’s budget t\nhe \nChancellor reaffirmed the Government commitment to Zero Carbon Homes. \nThe Government has made other legally binding commitments on CO2 reduction and Renewable Energy Production. In February 2013, the Prime Minister launched DECC’s Energy Efficiency Mission and \nemphasised \nthe \nimportance of green energy for \nclimate change, the economy and business.\n \nHowever, \nthis is\n not reflected \nin the current Part L standards\n and the proposal to repeal the Planning and Energy Act.\n15.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere will be an immediate impact for many Local Authorities if the act is repealed. For example, t\nhe use of the Planning and Energy Act appears in \nthe\n London Plan \nstating\n that all new major residential developments should set energy efficiency standa\nrds above current requirements \nand include on-site generation. As a result, 63% of new dwellings in London will have a \n10% renewable energy in 2014–16, this achievement will be jeopardised of the Act is repealed.\n              \nPart L in detail\n16.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA\n more ambitious target \nfor new build under Part L of the building regulations \nwould support industry to develop its supply chain thus driving down costs and \nalso \nencouraging more retrofit installations\n in existing buildings\n. However, because this supply will now take longer to develop, costs will remain higher for longer and as a result consumers are less likely to install retrofit installations. \n17.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhilst consumers \nin new build homes \nwill benefit from some reduction in their energy bills, up to £200 according to DCLG, the more ambitious target would have created savings up to five times higher. Thus fewer consumers will be protected from rising fuel costs and volatility in pricing. \n18.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRegulatory burden known as the ‘one in two out’ rule has created a distortion in how the costs and benefits are compared and the resulting savings to the economy. \nAt the level of the economy overall the extra costs of the higher target\n are more than funded by the additional savings and this has not been taken into consideration when creating the regulations. \n19.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUsing data in the\n 2012 consultation Impact Assessment the cost to society of the ‘halfway’ \napproach was estimated at £317m. However, the\n analysis did not include the benefits to consumers (£375m). When these figures are included \nin a cost benefit analysis \nthere is a net benefit to society of £58m. An analysis of the final Impact Assessment suggests the net benefit is even greater; the cost to society is \nestimated\n as £311m but the benefits to consumers are £391m giving a net benefit to society of £81m. Furthermore, using 2014 cost assumptions (when the regulations come into \nforces) the cost to society is estimated as \n£272m giving a net benefit of over £100m\n (see appendix A)\n. \n20.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe c\nosts of creating energy efficient homes are simply being displaced to the future \nat greater cost to consumers and the economy \nand furthermore the costs of retrofit installation will be greater than at new build. Incentives such as the Green Deal and the Renewable Heat Incentive will be required to find additional budget to deal with this legacy cost.\n&#xa0;\nWider housing issues\n21.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is recognised that there is a need in the UK to build more new homes and more affordable new homes. \nWe understand there is an argument that in order to ‘kick start’ this market, increased development costs should be avoided.\n22.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, \nthe result of this approach is to not\n accommodate\n the\n building\n of\n more energy efficient homes. This creates legacy costs for Government, dealing with these inefficient homes at a later date. And for consumers, who will be locked into higher energy costs until such time as retrofit improvements can be made, driving more households into fuel poverty.\n23.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhere is evidence available that new homes built to higher energy efficiency\n standards do have an increased value. \nA DECC report published in June 2013, ‘An investigation of the effect of EPC ratings on house prices’, found that: ‘there is a positive relationship between energy rating and dwelling price per square metre. Compared to dwellings rated EPC band G, dwellings with higher EPC ratings have sold at a statistically significant price premium and the pattern of the resul\nts is consistent and plausible.’\n \n24.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is also evidence that \nnew energy efficient \nhomes can be built at low cost and affordable prices. Richard Rogers’ Home Shell, was developed in response to the then Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott’s Design for Manufacture challenge to create a house that could be built \nfrom modern materials for £60,000\n. The building is designed to be energy efficient and a development of such homes has been in existence since 2007.\n&#xa0;\nConclusions\n25.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nPart L Building Regulations \nset at just\n 6% CO2 reduction\n, announced in July \nfor new homes\n,\n do\nes\n not set an ambitious enough target \nto\n drive the market in this sector. \n26.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe costs of building new energy efficient homes \nwith on-site renewables \nis cheaper for the economy overall than building lower cost housing because of the overall energy savings achieved, locked in for the lifetime of the building. \nThe lower running costs of energy efficient buildings and therefore savings to consumers create an overall net benefit that outweighs costs and is cheaper than paying to achieve carbon reduction and renewables targets through bills or taxation.\n \nFurthermore the cost to retrofit homes to a higher efficiency standard is greater than at new build.\n27.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTherefore the Planning and Energy Act must remain available to local authorities \nto enable them to drive \nuptake of on-site low carbon and renewable energy production in new homes\n,\n at least until \ntighter standards exist in \nBuilding Regulations.\n In addition, the Code for Sustainable Homes should also remain available until such time as the Building Regulations are strengthened. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAppendix APart L Building Regulations: Cost Benefit Analysis\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Bui\nlding Regulations model uses the Zero Carbon Homes\n energy profile for different house types to estimate the cost and\n benefits of installing microgeneration \ntechnologies (PV taken as a proxy\n) and energy efficiency measures in new buildings.\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUsing data from the 2012 consultation and Parsons Brinkerhoff* solar PV costs, the cost to society of the ‘\nhalfway’ approach was estimated at \n£317m. The analysis also \nestimated that the policy would result in benefits to consumers of \n£375m. Therefore a cost benefit analysis\n suggest\ns\n that there would be a net benefit to society of \n£58m.\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the latest analysis the benefits to consumers has increased to \n£391m \ndue to some \nchanges in the dwelling numbers\n and to a small increase in both gas and electricity emission factor. \n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe analysis is based on the Green Book 3.5% SDR. \n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n£311m is the cost of installing PV systems in new buildings using Parsons Brinckerhoff 2012 estimates (in line with DCLG September 2013 IA).\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n£272m would be the cost of installing PVs if Parsons Brinckerhoff 2014 cost estimates were input in the model.\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n£391m is the household savings using DCLG September 2013 revised dwelling assumptions\n.\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTherefore\n £119m is the net benefit\n (or \n£81m using the 2012 figures)\n.*Parsons Brinkerhoff, Solar PV Cost Update (May 2012) \n&#xa0;\n3\nrd\n October 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
