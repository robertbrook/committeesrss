Written evidence from Kevin Hurley, Crime Commissioner, Surrey [CST0037]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Please find below a response on behalf of Kevin Hurley, PCC for Surrey, to the questions posed in your letter of 6th December with regard to crime statistics.&#xa0;

[[[Response from Kevin Hurley, PCC for Surrey:]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;One of my first acts as PCC was to do away with numerical targets for the police force – the first in the country to do so. The target culture has had a negative impact on British policing over the last 20 years.&#xa0; Targets provide reassurance to politicians but they mean very little to the wider public. They can lead to perverse incentives towards policing activity that satisfies performance managers and no-one else.&#xa0;&#xa0; I believe that the impact of doing away with targets has been very positive for policing in Surrey and nationally.&#xa0; Locally we are seeing a police force confident to record correctly and do the right thing for the victim and public.&#xa0; We have seen detection rates fall as a result, due to audit and changes in recording practices.&#xa0; Whilst I would clearly like to see detection rates improved, it is more important that we correctly record what is happening.&#xa0;&#xa0; Nationally, I have lead the way in doing away with targets and with others following this should improve crime recording practices in England and Wales. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;My small team of support staff do not have capacity to carry out data audits so we can never be fully confident that data is 100% accurate.&#xa0; However, we do what we can to move towards that aim.&#xa0; As outlined above, the most important step has been the doing away of targets to give the freedom to record correctly.&#xa0; Surrey Police has an internal audit function, including audits in relation to crime data, and a force crime registrar in place. I have a senior member of staff who considers crime data, who meets with the force crime registrar and we receive copies of Surrey Police internal data audits.&#xa0;&#xa0; My office also has full and unrestricted access to the Surrey Police management information system and can look into data trends and ask appropriate questions.&#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0;We have also asked our Internal Auditors, Baker Tilly, to carry out an audit of Disposal Methods and Crime Recording.&#xa0; This has recently been done and we are currently considering the recommendations but indications are that the auditors have reasonable assurance that the right controls are in place and no high priority recommendations have been made.&#xa0; We will publish the results of this audit report in due course for transparency.&#xa0;&#xa0; We are aware that HMIC are currently gathering crime recording data from forces and will be doing fieldwork shortly on data quality and we look forward to receiving this external reporting of our, and national, crime data standards. &#xa0;I hold the Chief Constable to account at bi-monthly webcast management meetings.&#xa0;&#xa0; Performance information, including crime data, is presented at these meetings allowing me to ask questions with regard to any trends.&#xa0; Alongside a quarterly update on progress against the Police and Crime Plan, I publish a quarterly performance report from Surrey Police to provide public and community safety partners information on performance and allow extra external scrutiny. &#xa0;Although I have not set targets, I have set out the 6 People’s Priorities for policing and crime issues.&#xa0; &#xa0;These priorities include being uncompromising in police standards expected by the public.&#xa0; This would include the expectation for ethical and accurate crime recording practices. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Please do get back to me if you require any further information.&#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013
