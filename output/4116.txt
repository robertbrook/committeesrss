[[[INTRODUCTION]]]&#xa0;WWF is a leading global conservation organisation, employing over 5,000 staff in more than 100 countries and with more than 5 million supporters across the world.  The UK charity - WWF-UK - was launched in 1961.  We work in partnership with local communities, civil society organisations, governments, multinational agencies and the private sector on the issues of fresh water, biodiversity, climate change, forests, the marine environment, sustainable consumption, infrastructure and energy.&#xa0;We welcome the Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs Committee’s Inquiry into food security.  Our responses to the issues raised by the Committee focus on those areas most relevant to our work.&#xa0;
