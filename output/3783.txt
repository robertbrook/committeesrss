[[[What do you consider to be the likely prevalence of subclinical vCJD infection in the UK population? What evidence is there to support this view?]]]The following background may be helpful:Prions are infectious pathogens which cause lethal degenerative brain diseases in humans and other mammalian species. These diseases include scrapie in sheep and goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. Prions are distinct from other infectious agents in that they lack their own genetic material. They are thought to be composed of misfolded and aggregated forms of one of the body’s own proteins, the prion protein, and propagate by a process of seeded protein polymerisation (for review see1). The prion proteins in different mammalian species are closely similar in structure and prions from one species are able to infect another although usually with much lower efficiency than between individuals of the same species. Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) was first recognised in the UK in 1995 and is caused by a strain of prions quite distinct from those causing classical CJD and which was shown to the same as that causing BSE2-4. Exposure of the UK population to BSE prions via dietary and other routes was widespread. It is estimated that up to three million UK cattle were infected with BSE of which around 750,000 were slaughtered for human consumption5. In addition to primary infections from direct dietary or other exposure to BSE prions, concerns of secondary, human-to-human transmission have affected endoscopy, ophthalmology, surgery, dentistry, organ transplantation, blood products/transfusion, and emerging stem cell therapies. Secondary infections have been documented from use of contaminated blood and blood products6-8. Although the number of clinically recognised patients with vCJD has been thankfully relatively small (~200), the number of silent infections appears to be far larger.Prion infections are associated with long asymptomatic incubation periods. Studies of the epidemic prion disease kuru in Papua New Guinea, and of iatrogenic CJD resulting from exposure to contaminated human growth hormone, demonstrate incubation periods spanning decades. Cases of iatrogenic CJD occur every year in the UK, with recent incubation times estimated to be over 35 years. Approximately 3% of patients exposed to human growth hormone have developed clinical disease. Incubation periods in excess of 50 years have been documented in kuru9. It is important also to appreciate that these incubation periods arise from same species (human-to-human) transmission, cross-species transmissions are typically associated with much longer incubation periods which may approach the natural lifespan of the species concerned. Another important consideration is that it has been known for some years that infection of animals with prions from another species can result in a long-term infection or carrier state. Such subclinically infected animals may not develop the neurological disease during their lifespan but develop high levels of infectious prions. Transmission of such prions to more animals of the same species is typically associated with 100% lethality10.UK prevalence estimatesMy laboratory reported in 1997 that in vCJD, in sharp contrast to classical CJD where prions are largely confined to the brain and spinal cord, prions were much more widespread in the body and may be readily detected in so-called lymphoreticular tissues including the tonsil and appendix11, 12. I suggested at that time to the Department of Health that this finding potentially allowed an estimate of the prevalence of silent vCJD prion infection in the community by an anonymous screen of archived or discarded surgical appendix or tonsil specimens. A number of such studies have since been conducted13-17. A retrospective study of 12,674 archived surgical lymphoreticular specimens (predominantly appendix) in 2004 found three positives and estimated a prevalence of infection in the UK population of 237 per million (95% confidence interval 49-692 per million)14. Based on this study a prevalence estimate of 1 in 4000 was recommended by the former Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) for managing public health risks18, 19. Further studies of tonsil specimens did not significantly refine these estimates15, 16 and a further study was initiated by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) on advice from SEAC with the aim of analysing a minimum of 30,000 appendix samples. The study found 16 definite positive appendices out of 32,441 suitable samples examined, equating to a final prevalence estimate of 493 per million (95% CI: 282 to 801 per million)17. The prevalence in those born in 1941-60 (733 per million, 269 to 1596 per million) did not differ significantly from those born between 1961 and 1985 (412 per million, 198 to 758 per million) and was similar in both sexes and across the three broad geographical areas sampled.  This rate is consistent with the range of previous studies but is more precise and has a higher central estimate of around 1 infection in 2000 equating to around 20-30,000 infected carriers in the UK. The extraordinary range of incubation periods seen in natural human prion infections and the existence of subclinical carrier states in animal models exposed to prions from another species offer potential explanations for the huge discrepancy between estimates of infection prevalence and clinical cases20. While such carriers may live a normal lifespan without overt neurological disease, same species subpassage of infectivity is associated with 100% lethality10 arguing that asymptomatic human carriers would pose a distinct risk of transferring a fatal prion infection to others via medical and surgical procedures. Although the risks of iatrogenic prion transmission through surgery and solid organ transplantation should not be underestimated, the greatest threat to public safety is thought to be posed by the transfusion of prion-infected blood. The reality of vCJD transmission by this route has been known for some years and study of a small cohort known to have received blood from donors who subsequently developed vCJD suggests the risk is very high to such recipients6, 7, 21. Emerging experimental evidence from sheep scrapie22 (thought to be a good model of vCJD) are unexpectedly indicating blood transfusion may be a more efficient infection route than direct inoculation into the brain. Indeed, as little as 200l of infected blood is efficient in transmitting disease by transfusion in sheep23.It is conceivable that there could be some hitherto unknown explanation for abnormal PrP in the appendix, unrelated to vCJD prion infection (that is, false positives). Further work looking at this possibility is being done by HPA using appendices removed before the BSE epidemic. However, based on a wealth of data from examination of humans and animal tissues, abnormal prion protein in the appendix is highly likely to be an accurate diagnostic marker for vCJD infection. It should be noted that even the alarming estimate of 1 in 2000 infections in the UK population could be an underestimate since the sensitivity of the method used on appendix samples in carriers is not known and there could be significant numbers of false negative (true carriers in which abnormal prion protein is not detected in the appendix by these methods), indeed disease-related PrP is sometimes not detected in appendix samples from patients who have died of definite vCJD 24. In summary, our best estimate today is that ~1 in 2000 of the UK population is infected with vCJD prions. However, it is important to understand that what is really important from a public health risk management perspective is how many people have detectable prions in their blood rather than appendix since it is blood that presents the greatest risk of transmission to others. Consequently, prevalence studies using a blood test are also needed (see below).

[[[might this subclinical infection rate translate to future cases of vCJD?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[ What are the key uncertainties in the relationship between subclinical and clinical vCJD?]]]In order to predict the number of future cases of vCJD we would need to know what proportion of subclinical carriers will develop clinical disease, the range of incubation periods, and the mortality from other causes in this group prior to the development of clinical prion disease. It is possible that, as in some animal models, many of these individuals will be healthy carriers throughout their lives even if they live to advanced age. However, it will be many years before we know how many such subclinically infected individuals ultimately develop disease. Recently published experiments in mice that were genetically engineered to make human prion protein showed that inoculation of these animals with vCJD usually resulted in prion infection in lymphoreticular tissue, but only a minority of these animals developed clinical disease in their lifetime25. These experiments are a striking parallel with the current situation in the UK with a remarkably high prevalence of vCJD infection, but a much lower incidence of clinical disease20.We do not understand what determines whether a person will remain a healthy carrier of prion infection or develop the clinical state, for example whether there are environmental triggers that might lead to a carrier developing the disease. We do know, however, of powerful genetic factors that affect susceptibility to, and incubation periods, of prion diseases including vCJD. The most important of these is a polymorphism in the human prion protein itself which exists in two common forms known as M and V so there are three genetic types in the population: MM, MV and VV26, 27. All definite vCJD patients to date have been MM (a genetic type seen in about a third of the population). It is likely that clinical cases will occur in the other genotypes (VV and MV) but may have longer average incubation periods and also may present with a different pattern of disease that may not meet the diagnostic criteria of vCJD and indeed may be mistaken for classical CJD28, 29. One patient with probable vCJD was of the MV genotype30. All three genotypes were represented in the 16 appendices found to show subclinical vCJD infection in the HPA prevalence studies. Other genes have been identified with an effect on disease susceptibility or incubation period (for review see31).

[[[What are the likely routes of infection for vCJD? How have the potential modes of transmission changed over time?]]]The most likely cause of the primary epidemic of vCJD was dietary exposure to food products containing brain or spinal cord tissues from cattle infected with BSE. BSE prions also readily infect sheep and it is conceivable sheep-passaged BSE prions could also have been involved. Bovine products were widely used for other purposes, for instance in cosmetics and production of certain medicines including vaccines although no epidemiological link with vCJD has been demonstrated. The number of primary vCJD cases has fallen steadily in recent years. Secondary transmission is now the principal concern through blood, blood products, tissue or organ donation and contamination of surgical (including dental) instruments. While transmission of classical CJD by surgical instruments and tissue grafts has been well documented, to date vCJD transmission between humans has only been documented by via blood transfusion and use of blood products. However, the apparently high carrier state of vCJD prion infection in the UK population and much wider distribution of prions outside the brain and spinal cord in vCJD would argue that secondary vCJD cases arising from contaminated surgical instruments or tissue or organ transplantation should be anticipated in the years ahead.

[[[What procedures are currently in place to monitor, control and p]]]

[[[revent further spread of vCJD across the UK population? What more could be done to reduce the risk posed by vCJD?]]]Monitoring of vCJD clinical incidence is primarily the responsibility of the National CJD Research and Surveillance Unit (NCJDRSU) in Edinburgh. Most cases are identified following the referral of suspect cases by local neurologists, psychiatrists, general physicians and GPs to NCJDRSU or the NHS National Prion Clinic (NPC) in London. Telephone conversations several times weekly, and a formal monthly meeting between the NCJDRSU and NPC, ensures complete case coordination. There are concerns that cases might be missed in elderly patients where other causes of dementia are common, either because the classical clinical features of vCJD are not manifest, or that investigations required to raise concerns about CJD are not requested, or are misinterpreted. Several measures have been taken to minimise the risks of transmission by blood transfusion or use of blood products. The ongoing disruption and costs to the NHS as a consequence of these measures - of uncertain efficacy or necessity -&#xa0;are&#xa0;remarkable. From 1997-2005 a series of measures were introduced, including leucodepletion of blood, sourcing of plasma from non-UK sources, exclusion of transfusion recipients from donation, use of recombinant clotting factors for patients with bleeding disorders and ceasing the use of UK plasma for fractionation and export32.In 2010 the cumulative costs to the NHS Blood and Transfusion service were estimated at £540M, with a recurrent annual cost of £40M. Costs associated with other parts of the NHS have not been precisely estimated, however, the recurrent annual cost of synthetic clotting factors for patients with bleeding disorders is approximately £200M33.Concern regarding secondary transmission of vCJD has also had major effects on public health policy internationally. For example, the USA and Australia exclude those with a cumulative residence of six months or more in Europe as blood donors, with considerable disruption to the blood supply in some areas and for the US military. What more could be done to reduce the risk posed by vCJD? Risk could be effectively managed by: (i) the development of a blood test to allow screening of donated blood for vCJD prion infection thereby allowing exclusion of infected units from use for blood transfusion or production of blood products; (ii) screening patients due to undergo certain surgical procedures involving tissues at higher risk for prion infection (for example brain, spinal cord, the back of the eye, or certain dental procedures involving nervous tissue) so that particular precautions could be taken with those testing positive to minimise risk of infection of other patients; (iii) use of effective prion decontamination methods to prevent vCJD transmission on surgical instruments (prions stick avidly to surgical stainless steel and other surfaces and are partially resistant to normal hospital sterilisation methods); (iv) effective treatments for prion infection are being developed and might allow not only treatment of patients with the disease, but also treatment of asymptomatic infected individuals (for example those testing positive on suitable blood or other tests) to eradicate the infection before symptoms develop.Over a decade ago, the Department of Health invited and funded a large number of research proposals to develop novel methods for prion decontamination. This led to several products that might be used in a hospital environment. The MRC Prion Unit undertook a significant research project funded by this programme and developed an effective enzyme/detergent mixture that effectively destroyed prions on metal surfaces34, 35. We were successful in obtaining an industrial partner (DuPont) to turn this laboratory research into a practical product but this was not used in the NHS and is no longer in production. The product was formulated for use as a simple pre-soak to prion decontaminate instruments before they went into the standard hospital washer-disinfector machines. The lack of take up of this or other prion decontamination technologies in the NHS probably precluded further commercial investment to develop a second generation product which might have been integrated into washer-disinfector cycles for improved ease of use. Extensive research effort internationally has gone into developing a blood test for vCJD. My Unit developed the first such test which was reported in the Lancet in 201136. I discussed the test at high level with the Department of Health (Public Health Minister and Chief Medical Officer) in 2011 who advised they were not in a position to fund further evaluation or prevalence screening and recommended transfer to a commercial partner. Despite further discussions with diagnostics companies, facilitated by MRC Technology, no such commercial partner was identified. The clear feedback was that further test development and evaluation of the test specificity and a UK prevalence study to determine the market for such a test would be needed to make a business case. In order to maintain momentum in translating our technology to protect the public health the Unit has, with additional assistance from MRC, confirmed our initial specificity estimates with a much larger control cohort. This study was initiated following discussions with Professor Mark Turner (Chair, Prion Working Group of the National Blood Service) and Dr Lorna Williamson (Medical &amp; Research Director, NHSBT) regarding the requirements of the UK’s blood services. The NHS Blood and Transfusion (NHSBT), in consultation with other European partners, formalised a common technical specification requiring screening tests achieve a minimum diagnostic specificity of 99.5% determined from a cohort of 5000 samples37. We have now analysed 5000 anonymous donor samples provided by the American Red Cross. This is a cohort of samples from a nation with very low exposure to BSE. The conclusion of this study has been no positive reactions from the total of 5000 US samples demonstrating adequate specificity for our proposal to conduct a large scale comparison of  20,000 anonymous blood samples from the UK and USA. The establishment of accurate prevalence estimates for prionaemia will provide the essential information to determine if routine screening for vCJD infection in blood donations, and in patients prior to high risk surgical procedures and tissue and organ donation, is required. This is not only important from the perspective of risk management and protecting the health of the public but also to demonstrate a business case to justify the commercial investment required to produce a robust high throughput test from our laboratory prototype. The primary benefit of commercialising the assay would be the availability of a cost-effective screening test for use with donated blood and organs to prevent iatrogenic infection and safeguard the blood supply. The ability to screen human blood may ultimately obviate the need to import frozen plasma from the USA and allow UK based industries to recommence processing and sale of UK sourced plasma and plasma products.In addition to routine screening applications, knowledge of the background level of infection in the general population is required for the interpretation of test results if offered to individuals deemed to at risk of iatrogenic disease some of whom have already sought testing. After the successive tragedies of HIV and HCV infection in groups multiply exposed to blood products, there is understandably heightened concern about risks of prion disease transmission in blood products. A useable predictive test in these groups may offer an opportunity both for individuals to resolve issues of personal risk, and for anonymous studies to resolve issues of risk for groups of individuals following the formal notification exercise instigated by the HPA. Finally, the large international research effort on understanding prion diseases since the arrival of BSE has led to them becoming arguably the best understood cause of dementia. Indeed, there is growing evidence that the fundamental molecular mechanisms seen in prion disease may be relevant for much commoner neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and motor neurone disease (see38 for lay review). A number of potential therapeutics are in development at the MRC Prion Unit and elsewhere internationally that might allow both effective treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent development of clinical disease in healthy but infected individuals.&#xa0;Reference List              1.                   Collinge,J. &amp; Clarke,A.
