"&#xa0;\nEIS 08\nWritten evidence submitted by IntierraRMG (UK)&#xa0;\nThe contribution below (in \nbold) is made on behalf of IntierraRMG (UK), a mining database provider, whose head office is in Perth, Australia.\n&#xa0;\n1. What is the contribution to the UK economy of extractive industries in the UK?\nAlthough the direct contribution to the economy from the domestic extractive industry is low, there is a significant contribution from related sectors (see below).&#xa0;\n2. How does the UK-based extractive industr\ny\n support employment:\na) In the UK, and \nb) For UK citizens overseas?\nThis employment support (both within and external to the UK) stems, largely, from the UK's historic mining prowess. Because of its once-large extractive industry, the region has a well-developed mining equipment and service sector, which now supplies the international industry.&#xa0;\n3. Does UK industry benefit more widely from the UK’s position as a centre for extractive industries\n,\n \neg i\nn sales of machinery and services to international businesses in the sector?\nYes, clearly. Manufacturers in the UK design, make and despatch equipment for the international mining industry, and there are myriad organisations in the UK that can be expected to benefit from this activity. These include the importers and fabricators of metal, transport companies, external (local) consultants on design and construction, and banks/brokers that finance the work. Non-mining UK industries will also benefit from the additional earnings and expertise of the mining-related companies and their staff. &#xa0;Being an acknowledged centre of excellence will also attract visits by overseas mining companies, whose executives are likely to visit other associated industries while in the UK (eg the London Stock Exchange, London Metal Exchange, staff recruitment firms, risk assessors, security and logistics advisors, mining engineering firms and metals traders).&#xa0;\n4. Has the boom in London-listed extractive companies with businesses overseas over the last two decades resulted in a strengthening in the UK’s competitive position in this sector?\nThere is no clear direct evidence of a stronger competitive position. However, the improved strength in related sectors (finance, law and risk assessment) is likely to have made a positive indirect impact. For example, the UK accounted for almost 22% of the finance raised globally for mining in the quarter to end-June. This made the London Stock Exchange third only to the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Australia Stock Exchange.&#xa0;\n5. What are the corporate governance concerns raised by the number of extract\nive industries companies listed in the UK? Are there reputational risks for the UK and UK financial institutions in being a centre for such businesses?\nThere have been serious corporate-governance issues at several mining companies listed in the UK with operations overseas, and there is certainly a risk to the UK's reputation. This seems likely, however, to be kept under control.&#xa0;\n6. Is there sufficient engagement between UK extractive industries and the NGO sector? Are there examples of best practice in en\ngagement between the extractive industries and NGOs?\nThere is plenty of engagement between the two sectors, not least through the International Council of Metals and Mining. Nevertheless, more interaction is still required.&#xa0;\n7. Does the UK have the skills \nbase to remain a centre for the extractive i\nndustries and to ensure that UK-\nbased businesses benefit from potential future opportunities such as shale gas?\nYes, there is still a good-enough skills base. This is particularly strong in the finance and legal sectors, and there is perhaps concern that the engineering skills might start to wither without a strong domestic extractive industry.&#xa0;\n8. What is the impact of the industry of the UK signing up to the EITI?\nVery positive, in that the requirements of EITI are essential to maintaining reputational risk, which is still a core strength of UK businesses.&#xa0;\n9. Would \nincreased regulation for London-\nlisted extractive companies result in competition from elsewhere\n,\n or can it be used to make the UK a centre of excell\nence for best practice and corporate governance?\nThere is no choice in this matter. UK businesses are highly regarded for their competence and reliability. Increased regulation might increase short-term competition but it is probably essential to maintain good practice (especially with so-many overseas companies coming to the UK for finance and advice).&#xa0;\n10. What is the competitive landscape for the extractive\n industries in the 21st Century, \nand is it in the UK’s interest to\n remain a global centre\n?\nCompetition will increase with regard to the UK's supply of equipment and services, so domestic companies must focus on the quality and reliability of their offerings. This will be made easier if the UK (and London in particular) is able to maintain its role as a global centre of excellence.&#xa0;\nRegards\n&#xa0;\nDr Chris Hinde\nE\nditorial D\nirector\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 20th, 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
