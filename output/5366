defaultThis report records my experiences at Gatwick Airport on 24 December 2013. I was a passenger intending to fly to Jersey
default and was delayed as a result of storm damage to airport equipment
default. It has been written

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAfter breakfast and checking
default out of my room I crossed to North Terminal to see if I could find an earlier flight and to check in my suitcase.
default The time was approximately 10.30.

defaultwere
default n
defaulteither
default 
defaultbarriers 
defaultn
defaultor organised queues
default, but there were lines of people with luggage to which people attached themselves apparently at random
default. There 
defaultwas a complete lack of
default signs or notices giving
default any explanation,
default 
defaultinformation
default or advice. 
default 
defaultA waiting passenger
default told me that the electricity was off and that the baggage handling was not working.
default 
default&#xa0;
default(c)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEventually, a sole passenger services rep informed us that we should not try to check in until two hours before our scheduled 
defaultflight time. She was apologetic
default and concerned
default but was not able to provide any further information
default. Any information I received was from other passengers
default,
default was 
defaulttherefore 
defaultsecond
default-
defaulthand and possibly unreliable.
default At one point a man came and handed out bottles of wa
defaultter.
default&#xa0;
default(d)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn addition to BA passengers, passengers for Emirates were also 
defaultqueuing in the same area.
default&#xa0;
default(e)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSince my flight had been rebooked for the early evening, there was little I could do but wander around the terminal towing my suitcase
default.
default Eventually, the Emirates passengers departed and 
defaultthe BA end of the terminal 
defaultbecame less crowded. In other parts of the 
defaultterminal concourse were lar
defaultge piles of suitcases. The BA end of the terminal 
defaultbecame
default relatively calm
default and less crowded.
default 
defaultAt the other end 
defaultof the concourse was the easyJet area check-in area, 
defaultwhich was very crowded and
default resembled TV images from Syria of refugee camps.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere was little for me to do but to wait. During the afternoon some bottles of water and packets of biscuits an
defaultd sandwiches were placed under a Christmas tree in the main concourse of the terminal.
default&#xa0;
default(b)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMy flight was booked for 18.00 and so I joined the queue for check-in just before 16.00. I tried to use the self-service machine but it advised me to use the check-in d
defaultesk.  I was given my boarding card for flight BA 2776 and was told to take my checked-in suitcase to another part of the terminal. Before doing this, I opened the case and took out some items I considered 
defaultwould be needed if the separation from my suitcase 
defaultwere to be prolonged.
default I handed my suitcase to a passenger services representative who placed it alongside many others being stored on the terminal floor.
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI then went airside. After passing through the security check I entered the departure lounge
default at about
default 16.20
default.

defaultDeparture Lounge - Late Afternoondefault&#xa0;
default(a)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMy first impression
defaults were that the lounge was full and that there
default was of a mass of people surrou
defaultnding the information booth
default. Almost all the seats in various parts of the lounge were occupied. I went over to a la
defaultrge departure information screen and saw that most of the departure information related to easyJet flights, some of which showed departure times going back to early morning.
default 
default&#xa0;
default(b)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI also looked for British Airways information and observed that 
defaultneither the 12.0
default0 nor the 16.00 service 
defaultto Jersey
default had left and that passengers for them should wait for
default further announcement
defaults
default. I looked around for further information from British Airways and found none. There was not a single BA representative in the lounge. A passenger 
defaulttold me that a BA representati
defaultve had been assaulted and that 
defaultBA presence had therefore been removed
default from the lounge
default.
default There were no notice boards neither were there any screens providing any information.
default The only source of information was the 
defaultflight 
defaultdepart
defaultures screen.
default 
default&#xa0;
default(c)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe information for my 
defaultflight
default appeared to indicate departure
default at the scheduled time
default.
default However, as the departure time approached, misleading and contradictory messages began to appear against BA 2776: typically that the boarding gate would open at a specific time but then that a further announcement would be made at some time later than the
default gate opening time. No BA representative was present to provide reliable information.
default&#xa0;
default(d)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe large number of people crowding round the information booth occasionally exhibited angry behaviour. The booth contained a single young woman who was clearly overwhel
defaultmed.
default&#xa0;
default(e)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere were three police officers in the lounge, two men and a woman.
default They were dressed in 
defaulttactical vests and 
defaultmay have been
default carrying firearms. Their behaviour was 
defaultfrequently 
defaultconfrontational
default.
default One of the officers was
default sometimes
default aggressive in his manner. 
defaultThe behaviour of some passengers was certainly unpleasant at times, and 
defaultI saw two who
default 
defaultwere handcuffed and
default le
defaultd away
default. M
defaultost
default people appeared to be
default quiet and resigned
default. 
defaultOn one occasion I saw and heard 
defaultthe aggressive officer
default haranguing an elderly couple who had j
defaultust entered the lounge from the security check area
default. They were possibly survivors of a time when policemen were trusted and respected social agents. It was clear that they were upset by the policeman's behaviour.

defaultDeparture Lounge - Eveningdefault&#xa0;
default(a)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs the evenin
defaultg progressed, most of the easyJet flights were cancelled
default and affected passengers were asked to make their way landside
default.
default The police officers stationed themselves
default 
defaultinside the information booth. 
defaultAnnouncements of cancellations were frequently 
defaultmade
default by one of the
default police officers standing on the counter of the information booth. Announcements using the public address system were often drowned by the noise within the lounge, and frequently coincided with other announcements (some routine and recorded) which were not
default sup
defaultp
defaultressed.
default T
defaulthe number of people in lounge declined steadily
default from 19.00 onwards
default - mainly due to the cancellation of easyJet flights.

defaultfive
default hours.
default&#xa0;
default(c)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI had not seen any representative of British Airways. I had not received any message from any employee of British Airways, nor had I been offered any refreshment of any kind. 
default&#xa0;
default(d)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe were bussed to the aircraft which was
default parked on a remote stand. 
defaultIt took, perhaps
default,
default 30 minutes for all passengers to board the aircraft. 
defaultThe pilot apologised for the late departure, but also apologised that he was unable to 
defaultrouse
default

defaultfrom its stand. The aircraft eventually took off a

defaultustomers
default, 
defaultsome of whom were clearly distressed, exhausted and confused were unable to do anything but wait. The major problem was the total lack of any reliable, situational inform

default,
default engaged in any communication with people in the depa
defaultrture lounge.

defaultsenger. There was no indication - at any time - that the situation was being managed. No explanation was given about delayed departures, the reasons for delays or plans to overcome identified problems
default.
