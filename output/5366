[normal]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This report records my experiences at Gatwick Airport on 24 December 2013. I was a passenger intending to fly to Jersey
[normal] and was delayed as a result of storm damage to airport equipment
[normal]. It has been written 
[normal]to reflect 
[normal]my recollections
[normal] of the i
[normal]ncident
[normal] in chronological order
[normal]. I have tried to ensure that it records events as objectively as possible but make no apology for those occasions when the account may appear to be subjective.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]ii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I 
[normal]intended to
[normal] spend Christmas with family members in Jersey and 
[normal]had planned a journey by train
[normal] from Evesham
[normal] to Gatwick  and then by B
[normal]ritish 
[normal]A
[normal]irways
[normal] to Jersey
[normal] on
[normal] 
[normal]23 December
[normal] 2013
[normal], the day
[normal] before Christmas Eve
[normal], leaving at 16.00 on BA2774
[normal]. My booking reference was ZNNJ52.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]iii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]When I set out I was aware 
[normal]that 
[normal]stormy weather 
[normal]wa
[normal]s 
[normal]threatening the south of England
[normal] but expected that it would not adversely affect me. I 
[normal]checked in normally in the North Terminal and 
[normal]was at the 
[normal]departure
[normal] gate 
[normal]about to board my aircraft 
[normal]when it announced that the authorities in Jersey had closed the airp
[normal]ort.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]iv)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]BA rebooked my flight for 
[normal]18.00 
[normal]the following day and arranged accommodation for me at an airport hotel.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]v)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I 
[normal]a
[normal]woke
[normal] the following morning
[normal] to 
[normal]learn of the effects of the storm.
[normal] TV news 
[normal]informed
[normal] me 
[normal]that there was 
[normal]deva
[normal]station in the south of England. 
[normal]There were reports
[normal] of flooding
[normal] and of disruption to power supplies. There was also news
[normal] that rail services between London and Brighton were suspended, and of problems at 
[normal]Gatwick Airport.

[normal]My Experience of [bold]24 December [bold]i)[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Morning[bold]&#xa0;[bold](a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]After breakfast and checking
[normal] out of my room I crossed to North Terminal to see if I could find an earlier flight and to check in my suitcase.
[normal] The time was approximately 10.30.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]British Airways 
[normal]check-in area in the North Terminal 
[normal]appeared
[normal] chao
[normal]tic
[normal]. 
[normal]There
[normal] seemed to be 
[normal]hundreds
[normal] of p
[normal]eople milling around in disorder. There 
[normal]were
[normal] n
[normal]either
[normal] 
[normal]barriers 
[normal]n
[normal]or organised queues
[normal], but there were lines of people with luggage to which people attached themselves apparently at random
[normal]. There 
[normal]was a complete lack of
[normal] signs or notices giving
[normal] any explanation,
[normal] 
[normal]information
[normal] or advice. 
[normal] 
[normal]A waiting passenger
[normal] told me that the electricity was off and that the baggage handling was not working.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Eventually, a sole passenger services rep informed us that we should not try to check in until two hours before our scheduled 
[normal]flight time. She was apologetic
[normal] and concerned
[normal] but was not able to provide any further information
[normal]. Any information I received was from other passengers
[normal],
[normal] was 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]second
[normal]-
[normal]hand and possibly unreliable.
[normal] At one point a man came and handed out bottles of wa
[normal]ter.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](d)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In addition to BA passengers, passengers for Emirates were also 
[normal]queuing in the same area.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](e)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Since my flight had been rebooked for the early evening, there was little I could do but wander around the terminal towing my suitcase
[normal].
[normal] Eventually, the Emirates passengers departed and 
[normal]the BA end of the terminal 
[normal]became less crowded. In other parts of the 
[normal]terminal concourse were lar
[normal]ge piles of suitcases. The BA end of the terminal 
[normal]became
[normal] relatively calm
[normal] and less crowded.
[normal] 
[normal]At the other end 
[normal]of the concourse was the easyJet area check-in area, 
[normal]which was very crowded and
[normal] resembled TV images from Syria of refugee camps.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]ii)[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Afternoon[bold]&#xa0;
[normal](a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There was little for me to do but to wait. During the afternoon some bottles of water and packets of biscuits an
[normal]d sandwiches were placed under a Christmas tree in the main concourse of the terminal.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]My flight was booked for 18.00 and so I joined the queue for check-in just before 16.00. I tried to use the self-service machine but it advised me to use the check-in d
[normal]esk.  I was given my boarding card for flight BA 2776 and was told to take my checked-in suitcase to another part of the terminal. Before doing this, I opened the case and took out some items I considered 
[normal]would be needed if the separation from my suitcase 
[normal]were to be prolonged.
[normal] I handed my suitcase to a passenger services representative who placed it alongside many others being stored on the terminal floor.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I then went airside. After passing through the security check I entered the departure lounge
[normal] at about
[normal] 16.20
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]iii)[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Departure Lounge - Late Afternoon[bold]&#xa0;
[normal](a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]My first impression
[normal]s were that the lounge was full and that there
[normal] was of a mass of people surrou
[normal]nding the information booth
[normal]. Almost all the seats in various parts of the lounge were occupied. I went over to a la
[normal]rge departure information screen and saw that most of the departure information related to easyJet flights, some of which showed departure times going back to early morning.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I also looked for British Airways information and observed that 
[normal]neither the 12.0
[normal]0 nor the 16.00 service 
[normal]to Jersey
[normal] had left and that passengers for them should wait for
[normal] further announcement
[normal]s
[normal]. I looked around for further information from British Airways and found none. There was not a single BA representative in the lounge. A passenger 
[normal]told me that a BA representati
[normal]ve had been assaulted and that 
[normal]BA presence had therefore been removed
[normal] from the lounge
[normal].
[normal] There were no notice boards neither were there any screens providing any information.
[normal] The only source of information was the 
[normal]flight 
[normal]depart
[normal]ures screen.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The information for my 
[normal]flight
[normal] appeared to indicate departure
[normal] at the scheduled time
[normal].
[normal] However, as the departure time approached, misleading and contradictory messages began to appear against BA 2776: typically that the boarding gate would open at a specific time but then that a further announcement would be made at some time later than the
[normal] gate opening time. No BA representative was present to provide reliable information.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](d)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The large number of people crowding round the information booth occasionally exhibited angry behaviour. The booth contained a single young woman who was clearly overwhel
[normal]med.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](e)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There were three police officers in the lounge, two men and a woman.
[normal] They were dressed in 
[normal]tactical vests and 
[normal]may have been
[normal] carrying firearms. Their behaviour was 
[normal]frequently 
[normal]confrontational
[normal].
[normal] One of the officers was
[normal] sometimes
[normal] aggressive in his manner. 
[normal]The behaviour of some passengers was certainly unpleasant at times, and 
[normal]I saw two who
[normal] 
[normal]were handcuffed and
[normal] le
[normal]d away
[normal]. M
[normal]ost
[normal] people appeared to be
[normal] quiet and resigned
[normal]. 
[normal]On one occasion I saw and heard 
[normal]the aggressive officer
[normal] haranguing an elderly couple who had j
[normal]ust entered the lounge from the security check area
[normal]. They were possibly survivors of a time when policemen were trusted and respected social agents. It was clear that they were upset by the policeman's behaviour.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]iv)[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Departure Lounge - Evening[bold]&#xa0;
[normal](a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As the evenin
[normal]g progressed, most of the easyJet flights were cancelled
[normal] and affected passengers were asked to make their way landside
[normal].
[normal] The police officers stationed themselves
[normal] 
[normal]inside the information booth. 
[normal]Announcements of cancellations were frequently 
[normal]made
[normal] by one of the
[normal] police officers standing on the counter of the information booth. Announcements using the public address system were often drowned by the noise within the lounge, and frequently coincided with other announcements (some routine and recorded) which were not
[normal] sup
[normal]p
[normal]ressed.
[normal] T
[normal]he number of people in lounge declined steadily
[normal] from 19.00 onwards
[normal] - mainly due to the cancellation of easyJet flights.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A
[normal]t about
[normal] 
[normal]21.
[normal]35
[normal] the departures indicator screen s
[normal]tated
[normal] that passengers for BA2776 should go to the boarding gate. I had be
[normal]en in the lounge for over 
[normal]five
[normal] hours.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I had not seen any representative of British Airways. I had not received any message from any employee of British Airways, nor had I been offered any refreshment of any kind. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](d)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We were bussed to the aircraft which was
[normal] parked on a remote stand. 
[normal]It took, perhaps
[normal],
[normal] 30 minutes for all passengers to board the aircraft. 
[normal]The pilot apologised for the late departure, but also apologised that he was unable to 
[normal]rouse
[normal] 
[normal]operations staff to arrange for a tug to push the aircraft away 
[normal]from its stand. The aircraft eventually took off a
[normal]t 
[normal]about 
[normal]22.45 and arrived at Jersey at about 
[normal]23.
[normal]15
[normal]. We were told that our luggage would arrive on Boxing Day or later and were given details of a website where we could register our luggage and state delive
[normal]ry preferences.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Discussion[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I consider the attitude and behaviour 
[normal]of Gatwick Airport and of British Airways
[normal] during the time that I was at the airport
[normal] to
[normal] have 
[normal]be
[normal]en
[normal] unacceptable.
[normal] 
[normal]I am not able to make any comment on the behaviour of easyJet since I was no
[normal]t a passenger of easyJet and was not affected by the company's actions. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]ii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]C
[normal]ustomers
[normal], 
[normal]some of whom were clearly distressed, exhausted and confused were unable to do anything but wait. The major problem was the total lack of any reliable, situational inform
[normal]ation. Passengers were not formally informed of the reasons for delays. Neither the airport, whose property had been affected by the storm, nor the carriers, who had direct responsibility for passengers
[normal],
[normal] engaged in any communication with people in the depa
[normal]rture lounge.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]iii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Things can go wrong, there can be 
[normal]unexpected catastrophic events
[normal], to leave customers in a state of complete ignorance is unforgiveable for any customer-focussed organisation
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]In so far as any information appeared to be available, it came 
[normal]from mobile telephone conversations passengers were making with people outside the airport.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]iv)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The hallmark of a competent, quality-driven enterprise is how well it can cope with the unexpected, not how we
[normal]ll it can manage a steady state.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]v)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Gatwick North Termi
[normal]nal does not appear to have any reliable passenger information system. It 
[normal]sh
[normal]ould have been
[normal] possible
[normal] to have provided information about the situation and its cause using 
[normal]flipcharts
[normal], whiteboards or blackboards
[normal].
[normal] No-one bothered to 
[normal]warn passengers 
[normal]in the secur
[normal]ity area 
[normal]about the situation they would find in the departure lounge. No-one bothered to explain to
[normal] passengers the nature or scope of the problems faced or how it was planned to deal with the problems.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]vi)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]British Airways
[normal] 
[normal]should have had identifiable staff p
[normal]resent. The absence of BA staff was interpreted by many passengers as a lack of concern for customers, complacency and even contempt. At no time was any reliable information or advice beyond the limited information on the departures screen given to any pas
[normal]senger. There was no indication - at any time - that the situation was being managed. No explanation was given about delayed departures, the reasons for delays or plans to overcome identified problems
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]vii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A large crowd 
[normal]sh
[normal]ould have been treated with considera
[normal]tion and respect. 
[normal]There were groups of passengers in the lounge who clearly had specific information needs. 
[normal]An appropriate strategy would have been to 
[normal]deal with the 
[normal]such 
[normal] groups of passengers
[normal] b
[normal]y
[normal] identifying the
[normal]m
[normal] and 
[normal]taking
[normal] them from the lounge, perhaps to unused departure gates or
[normal] to
[normal] appropriate lounges
[normal], 
[normal]where 
[normal]they
[normal] could receive explanations, advice and instructions, and have their needs 
[normal]attended to.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]viii)
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Gatwick Airport and British Airways 
[normal]each
[normal] failed
[normal] to act effectively and de
[normal]monstrated management deficiencies
[normal] to some degree or other
[normal]. 
[normal]Both
[normal] organisations should examine their actions, consider how things could have been done differently and inst
[normal]all
[normal] policies
[normal] and plans for future occasions.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4)[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Recommendations[bold]&#xa0;[bold]i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Gatwick
[normal] Airport, toge
[normal]ther with carriers operating there, should install information systems which can provide 
[normal]reliable 
[normal]explanatory, 
[normal]narrative
[normal] and detailed
[normal] information to passengers, not just details of arrival and departure.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]ii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]When public address announcements are made, there s
[normal]hould be a mechanism for routine security recorded announcements to be sup
[normal]p
[normal]ressed
[normal] when operational and passenger service announcements are being made.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]iii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Where it is necessary to provide specific information to specific groups of passengers, the opportunity 
[normal]should be taken to segregate such passengers from others in the departure lounge.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]iv)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There should always be representatives of carriers available to provide information and deal with enquiries.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]v)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Appropriate information about operational problems which may af
[normal]fect passengers should be available in the check-in area and the security check area.
