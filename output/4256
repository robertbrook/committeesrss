default“IKEA UK first charged for one use plastic carrier bags in June 2005. By September of the same year, numbers of single-use bags given away had dropped from 615,000 a week to 33,000 being purchased by customers for 10p each. 
defaultThe swift and steep 95% drop in bag use
default&#xa0;
defaultprompted IKEA to revise its policy further and, in 2006, it completely stopped providing customers with single-use carrier bags at its checkout lines. 
defaultSince then, it has realised £3.5m in reduced operational costs on purchasing bags and witnessed full acceptance by its customers who now know that they must bring their own bags to the store or purchase an IKEA Big Blue or Baby Blue bag. 
defaultThis is a bag for life which they can return at any time if it wears out free of charge.
defaultCheckout process times and efficiency have speeded up and the levels of litter in the store and car park have dropped also.
defaultThe re-introduction of paper carriers which had in previous years been used by IKEA stores were rejected as a replacement due to fact that paper can have a higher environmental impact, with one pallet of plastic bags equating to 10 pallets of paper. 
defaultPaper bags are degradable but generally only have one use before being discarded. Providing a high quality durable bag for life with the IKEA Blue bag and at a low price was considered the best environmental option.”
