The vast majority of the routes we research are exempt from the extinguishment of public motor vehicular rights brought about by the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 (NERC), because they are on the “list of streets”, the list of highways maintainable at public expense.  If I find that a route has historic public vehicular rights because it was set out in an enclosure award in the 18</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';

font-size:12pt"> century as a route that the public could use with horse drawn vehicles, it will automatically, under the present law, becomes a BOAT and thus open to modern motor vehicles.   In other cases there may be no clear evidence as to whether the route has historic public vehicular, public bridleway or public footpath rights, so that the highway authority (or the Planning Inspectorate if the highway authority’s decision is disputed) has to make a decision on the basis of the balance of probability.   It is also possible that modern use by 4x4s and motorbikes may be sufficient for such routes to become BOATs, even if historically they were only bridleways or footpaths.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt;

font-size:12pt">I am aware that there are many green lanes in the Yorkshire Dales National Park, the Nidderdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and the Peak District National Park which have historic public rights for horse-drawn vehicles, and which, being on the list of streets, are not protected by NERC.  But many of these were never maintained even for use by horse and cart, and were probably little used by such vehicles, being superseded by alternative routes tarmaced in the 20</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:8pt; vertical-align:super">th</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> century.  An example is Deadman’s Hill (case study 4.2 in YDGLA’s submission) where horse-drawn vehicle use was probably only by the residents of the hamlets which it linked in Nidderdale and Coverdale.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt;

font-size:12pt">I therefore strongly support the amendments proposed by YDGLA, PDGLA, GLEAM and GLPG, because they would make green lanes on the list of streets into restricted byways, in line with the historic use of most of such routes, and would make it easier for local communities to get traffic regulation orders on other green lanes. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt;
