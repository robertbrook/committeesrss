font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> William, it is really good to see you. Thank you so much for coming in today. We are </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">very</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> pleased to see you. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">You will probably know that the Committee has had a long-running interest in this question of war powers and the division or, as I would prefer to call it, the partnership between the Executive and Parliament on how we best deal with the issue of what happens around the time of a conflict, or before or immediately after a conflict, and where Parliament fits into that. We have had a bit of practice over the last 10 years and I think we are close to a standard practice, and indeed some would argue we have a convention already. Those things are always tested, of course, when the convention breaks down or is not operated so we are still very keen to ensure that this is in writing in some shape or form. We are all open to offers in terms of where and when. That is essentially where we are coming from and we would like to talk to you about getting some sort of progress on that and some sort of way forward.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Would it be helpful to let you make an introduction?

The Cabinet Office leads on this, in consultation with the FCO and the MOD as the main interested Departments, and a continuing discussion goes on across these three Departments. It helps that I also have an FCO hat. In the Lords, as you know, we have to be maids of all work. We continue to discuss, in the light of discussions in committees in both Houses and events such as the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Syria</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> intervention, which it seems to us has strengthened the convention and in that sense was a significant event in the evolution of relations between the Executive and the Legislature in this area.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q23 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Fabian </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Hamilton</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Lord Wallace, you will be pleased to know that I am the only </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Yorkshire</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> representative here today, but it is good to have Lord Wallace of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Saltaire</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> with us.

If I am not mistaken, that was the very first time that a Prime Minister felt it necessary to rely on a vote in Parliament, which the Whips told us was something that would not take place if it did not get a majority or if the majority of Labour MPs voted against it. Of course we know what happened, and you may agree that that has informed subsequent votes on conflict within the House of Commons and the House of Lords. In March 2011, the Foreign Secretary, William Hague, said that the Government would “enshrine in law for the future the necessity of consulting Parliament on military action”. What is the Government’s current view of that commitment?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Wallace of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Saltaire</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: I was slightly frightened when I saw your call for evidence suggest that “since the Government has a clear, positive position on all this”. The Government has an evolving position. This Government, like its predecessor, has discovered as it goes into it that this is a great deal more complex than one thought. The definition of armed conflict and the deployment of forces has all sorts of ragged edges, questions of urgency and secrecy come in, and let me just remark on both Iraq and Syria. We are all conscious that the decision on </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Iraq</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> was taken by a Parliament that did not have the full information and arguably could not have had the full intelligence information that the Government had. I was briefed by the Government. I was then my party’s defence spokesman in the Lords and was briefed alongside Ming Campbell. I did not accept what we were given and, as you know, my party voted against. The question of how full the information is, let alone the legal advice that can be given to Parliament, is always a difficult issue. When I wound up in the House of Lords for the Government on </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Syria</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, we decided to consult Parliament in a hurry and not all the information was available yet. I discovered at the end of the Lords debate that things I had said in the wind-up were news to a number of people on both sides of the Lords. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">We are in the process of discovering we need a strong convention but how we actually interpret it, let alone how we legislate on it or whether we should legislate on it, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">is</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> a large question. Legislation and judicial review go together and the Government has become much more sensitive about judicial review of military action.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q24 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Fabian </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Hamilton</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> So you don’t believe this Government would enshrine in law the necessity for consulting Parliament?

The Cabinet Manual has been revised and will be revised again. I suspect your Committee will be considering whether or not you wish to have a parliamentary resolution on this. I think the Government will be very hesitant about going further. Having now read in detail different definitions of armed conflict, having read Philippe Sands’ evidence to you last time round on the range of different legal opinions you could get as to whether Government action was legal or not—I thought Philippe was extremely honest about that—I am rather strengthened in my view that this is a very complicated area. In particular, once one gets the legal dimension into it, we might be entering more of a morass than an area of certainty.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q25 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Fabian </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Hamilton</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Philippe Sands was very helpful to us last week. In correspondence with the Chair of this Committee, back in February 2013, the Foreign Secretary said that the Government has commissioned work from a number of Departments to help reach agreement on the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">way ahead. What work has been commissioned, from which Departments, and when is it expected to be completed?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Wallace of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Saltaire</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: From the three Departments I mentioned and of course from the Attorney-General’s office, because the legal dimension is important on this. The next piece of work to emerge will be the Government’s response to the Lords Constitution Committee report. I suspect that the next piece to emerge after that will be the Government’s response to your Committee’s report.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q26 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Fabian Hamilton:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> You have mentioned the three Departments.

As we said earlier, and we have discussed this already, it was William Hague who committed the Government to enshrining Parliament’s role in conflict decisions in legislation. Various Government Ministers have given evidence since then to committees or answered questions in Parliament on this. Is there one particular Minister who has responsibility for this issue? Is it yourself?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Wallace of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Saltaire</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: The Deputy Prime Minister is responsible for constitutional issues broadly defined.

We are agreed with that. We all see the sense in that, but the message from it is, “Trust us, we are the Government”. After </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Iraq</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> and the Helmand decisions, there is a distinct lack of trust both in Parliament and in the country generally, which was the reason we had the splendid decision on </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Syria</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. The fear is that Governments will abuse any loophole like that. While we understand that there are very different conflicts and some might need urgent action, what really is required is something that strongly defines the supreme role of Parliament in taking decisions to send our troops to war. Have you any idea what particular areas are making it difficult for progress to be made?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Wallace of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Saltaire</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: It is partly the complexity of the spectrum of troop deployment. We have at the moment a troop deployment, which is the first British-Irish joint deployment, in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Mali</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> to train the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Mali</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> army, which is intended purely to be a training mission. I know that you have an active interest in what happened in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Helmand</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. You will recall that </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Helmand</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> was seen originally as a mission that was going to be regional reconstruction and post-conflict rebuilding. We did not know, we were not perhaps informed, and the military certainly were not aware of just how </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Helmand</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> would turn from one sort of conflict into another. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">If there is a clear and immediate kinetic aspect to a conflict, like bombing </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Benghazi</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> or a missile strike on Syrian chemical weapons, you have a clear case, you know what you are doing, and Parliament has to be very clearly consulted. In the case of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Benghazi</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, a question of urgency meant that Parliament was consulted after. With </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Syria</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> was easier to do it before although, as I say, I think we hurried it too much for various reasons, thus Members of Parliament did not have time to consider the full implications or to learn about the full implications. One MP said to me late at night after the debate that he had just 24 hours before been sitting on his beach in the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Mediterranean</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> without having read newspapers for three weeks and he had not had a chance to catch up. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">There are always problems, particularly when something arises urgently, but I do think that more and more often we are likely to be deploying troops to what we see as being conflict prevention exercises or post-conflict reconstruction exercises, often in international forces, so it will not be a purely British operation.

I raise this not to do with the present monarch, but the real power to go to war is not the Government’s or Parliament’s, it is the monarch’s power, a royal prerogative. We have had previous monarchs who were mad and bad. We could possibly have them in the future, but we give them a power that really should be vested in Parliament so perhaps we should look at prerogative powers again. There was the previous Government’s draft war powers resolution and a draft Bill published by the Public Administration Committee as a basis for formalising Parliament’s role.

The definition of armed conflict is itself evolving as drones, missiles and other dimensions become much more important. To say troops on the ground, boots on the ground, is after all not now by any means the only definition of conflict so that is partly why we do not think those resolutions were entirely adequate. You and I might well agree that the problem of unbridled prime ministerial power is one that the British constitution has, in effect, suffered from. I am sure you would also agree with me that one of the answers to that is effective coalition government.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> We were with you so far down that road and then you spoilt it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Paul Flynn:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> That power was happily bridled on 29 August and may it happen again more frequently in future—the power of Prime Ministers.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q34 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Could I add to that point that if there are definitional difficulties around conflict, then clearly it is even more important to resolve them with Parliament and the Executive rather than leave them to be interpreted by a convention. If it is not clear to all of us, it can’t be clear as a convention, so the convention suddenly becomes open to lots of differing interpretations. It is probably a strong argument to work this through very carefully together and get definitions that we can all agree with, which will stick in the difficult times not the easy times. They are obviously there when interpretation is required and I think that would be a very firm base for people to decide whether we go to conflict or report on a conflict that has taken place.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Wallace of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Saltaire</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: I think there has to be a continuing dialogue on this. British armed forces have not been actively involved in peacekeeping operations very much over the last 10 years because we have been so heavily committed first in Iraq and then in Afghanistan. I think it likely that as troops withdraw from the Afghan commitment we will be more actively engaged in conflict </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">prevention, post-conflict reconstruction, all of those sorts of activities. As we know, some are entirely without mishap. Others, as for example, the UN peacekeeping forces in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Lebanon</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> and in the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Golan Heights</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, can end up with people being killed and having to defend themselves. I think it highly likely that British troops are likely to be engaged in providing logistical and transport support to African Union forces and others in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Africa</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> where the Ugandans or South Africans will be asked to go in. They will not have the planes or the intelligence or the command and control structures and others will have to provide them. So there will be a whole set of issues. It is unlikely that British troops will be operating alone without the forces of other countries in many of these.

There are currently 16 European security and defence policy operations under that heading. The British have small numbers of troops in 14 of them. They range from the Somali piracy operation to various others. I suspect that if we wanted to inform Parliament about all of these, not very many Members of Parliament would want to be informed.

It needs to be done very carefully, but we have had a number of examples where the current convention was created and tested almost literally in the heat of battle. I think what the Committee is suggesting is that rather than raise this issue again when emotions are running high, when there are political passions at play and lives are at risk, it is incumbent upon all of us—because I don’t think there is a lot that separates us; I think we are talking about how we get the words right—that we do that job now. We do it in a timely way and we don’t leave it undone for a moment when another unexpected event arises and suddenly we are going to pitch people into harm’s way. I hope you will agree that it is incumbent upon us now to use our best efforts to try to resolve this in a cool, calculated way ahead of any conflict that takes place in the future, if we possibly can.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Wallace of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Saltaire</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: I agree with that. The </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Syria</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> case was a significant development and your Committee might well want to reflect on the implications of that. You certainly might also wish to reflect on how Parliament would appropriately respond to, for example, a UN resolution asking for a multilateral peacekeeping force to manage post-conflict order in a conflict-ridden state in the Middle East or </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">North Africa</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> and how it would also manage with treaty obligations under NATO if a NATO situation came up.

The Government has talked about consulting Parliament wherever possible before troops are committed, the urgency question and the secrecy dimension of it being, of course, limiting factors. There will be naturally cases where if you are about to commit troops you don’t want to have to explain to Parliament everything that you might be about to do because everyone else is listening in to what you say. The principle that Government should consult is clearly now established as a convention. What I am signalling to you is that I think it is equally important that Government should continue to consult throughout an operation. I do think that the quarterly statements on </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Afghanistan</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> and a number of other developments like that are also an important part of this process. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">You might wish to make comment on, for example, how Government would maintain a dialogue with the appropriate departmental committee, probably the Defence Committee, on plans, commitments and so on, about which I am often struck that Parliament is remarkably uninformed.

I am not aware that any MP has ever asked to know that or how closely the United Kingdom Government has been involved with the Nordic group in developing a European battle group on which there are currently discussions as to how it might be reshaped so that it could respond to mixed humanitarian and conflict prevention operations. Those are the sorts of areas where MPs have not yet been terribly interested in knowing what is going on.

It had to, but since it was going to take a certain amount of time to organise it and to get there it fitted very well into the framework. If there were an attack on a particular British core interest where it was clear where the attack had come from and it was possible to make an immediate response, I can imagine a hypothetical situation in which the Government might decide to respond immediately and to consult Parliament as soon as possible afterwards. That is part of the urgency dimension of this. In the ultimate hypothetical, if there were a nuclear attack on the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">United Kingdom</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, it is highly unlikely that Parliament would be recalled to discuss whether or not the Government should respond. We hope that is an extremely hypothetical case but that is part of the spectrum. We all understand there are circumstances in which it is relatively easy to consult Parliament before and there are others in which, as in Benghazi, it may be felt that you need to make at least a limited intervention before you have time to recall Parliament.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q41 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Turner:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> What information about the legality of a conflict decision does the Government think should be made available when Parliament considers these decisions?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Wallace of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Saltaire</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: It is a very strongly established convention that the advice given by the Attorney-General, which includes advice on interpretation of the law, contested areas where it might be open to challenge, for obvious reasons—that is what the Government’s in-house lawyers should be doing—should not be disclosed to Parliament. I think the evidence you had last week demonstrates some of the problems with interpretations of humanitarian law and international law. So the question is this legal under international law, which is increasingly the sort of question that people are now asking, is not at all an easy one for any lawyer to answer. I used to be a professor at the London School of Economics. I recall asking for advice on a particular international conflict from one of my colleagues in the law department and she began by saying, “I should warn you before we start to discuss it that I have provided legal opinions to both sides in this conflict”.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q42 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Turner:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> What do you think of the proposal last week that we need a parliamentary committee or something like that that can obtain legal advice very quickly?

Parliament is a political body. It has lawyers within it and we all have lawyers we can consult. Philippe Sands happens to be an old friend of mine and I have consulted him informally on all sorts of occasions about various things. I am not sure that Parliament itself needs that formal legal counsel as you are suggesting, an alternative to the Attorney-General, who would be the parliamentary adviser on all of these things. That is my instinctive response. You may wish to suggest something different. That would be throwing another element into the debate.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> I think we all have to recognise that future conflicts are going to be much more closely surrounded by legal argument, as indeed was the Bosnian intervention, the Kosovo intervention that took place without UN Security Council approval and was open to challenge under international law. The Russians play a very strong role on things that do not have UN Security Council approval. Given that we are going to have all of these legal arguments, and the responsibility to protect in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">humanitarian law are even more difficult, it might be that you wish to have some formal legal approval but you will not get formal legal certainty and I think that is one of the reasons why we are all so worried about judicial review.

Part of the difficulty there is if in supporting an action, particularly in voting for an action that subsequently is illegal, Members of Parliament themselves are complicit in breaking international law, or even arguably failing to resist subsequent actions that are regarded as criminal, as in war crimes committed as a result of that action. Colleagues have heard this. In the Iraq conflict I remember asking the Clerk for Parliament’s legal view and being sent to the fellow who does health and safety and employment law who was absolutely bemused by my requests for an opinion on whether what we were doing was legal or not.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Wallace of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Saltaire</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: This may be a question that you might want to raise further in your report in that case, but we all know the difficulties of interpreting international law. One of the firmest conventions to which we have signed up is the convention that outlaws chemical weapons. Chemical weapons had been used in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Syria</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. Parliament decided that that did not trigger the requirement for action to enforce the convention.

One is to repeat that it is better that we resolve our partnership around these very difficult issues of going to war or military action at a moment where we can be cool and considered rather than for this to become a political issue when there is a conflict at a future point. So I hope you share with me the view that it is incumbent upon us to put our shoulders to the wheel and find the words that can satisfy everybody.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Wallace of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Saltaire</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: I share that view. I very much see this as a partnership rather than a confrontation, but I hope that we all recognise that the phrase “boots on the ground” is now one that does not necessarily imply armed conflict. That is part of why we need to talk about dialogue as well as partnership. The sort of troop deployments that we will have in the future, some of which may, as Paul was remarking in an earlier session, lead to armed conflicts or higher levels of conflict than we had anticipated, is part of the world in which we are likely to be operating.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q46 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> The second things is just to reassure you that, having been with this issue for a long time and as Select Committee Chair listening to my colleagues on this issue for some considerable time, I have never heard a single member talk about this resolution in terms of training missions and peacekeeping. We are looking at the other end of the spectrum, which is the one that we are familiar with, for example in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Iraq</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> or </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Syria</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, and that is where the Committee’s focus has been. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">My final point is about when we can bring this to a head and resolve it. I am not at all suggesting it is next week. However, we have been with this issue for quite a long time and we have had various people commit to various courses of action over the piece. There have been forms of words in the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">documents produced under the auspices of the last Prime Minister. I can say, William, as you can gather from this morning, we are a very friendly bunch. The only time I have ever seen my colleagues get really annoyed and upset was over the Lobbying Bill when the Government failed to come up with a sensible response to us in over a year. They turned very ugly and it was a stomach-turning sight to see these gentle pussycats get really annoyed. I don’t ever want to see that again. What I am saying, more seriously, is that I hope that we can conclude this within a reasonable timescale and I hope that you share that view.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Wallace of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Saltaire</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: The Government will look forward to your Committee’s report and will respond to that, I hope in good time. I take your point about the good time required and let’s continue on that basis.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Excellent. William, we look forward to further negotiation or interaction with you. If it is helpful for me or members of the Committee to talk to you informally, we would be absolutely delighted to do that. I think there is 98% agreement already in terms of where we need to go on here. With goodwill on both sides, the last couple of percentage points can be put to bed and we can deal with this issue to the satisfaction of people over many years to come, I hope. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Thank you for your time. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">All the very best.</span></p><p style="line-height:28pt; margin:14pt 0pt 9pt; text-align:center"><span style="color:#005232; font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman'; font-size:10pt">              </span><span style="color:#005232; font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman'; font-size:10pt">Oral evidence: Parliament’s role in conflict decisions, HC 649</span><span style="color:#005232; font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman'; font-size:10pt">              </span><span style="color:#005232; font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman'; font-size:10pt">10</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
