I have practised clinically throughout that time both within the NHS and independently, in hospitals and the community environments. I have followed with close interest how the midwifery profession has been regulated both with the NMC and its predecessor, the UKCC, as I am passionate as a midwife that mothers and babies receive the best care possible. I offer this submission to the Committee as an observant registrant who has never been referred to the regulator. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">With public protection a fundamental corner stone of any healthcare system, the NMC’s role is regulator of two separate professions, nursing and midwifery.

Unfortunately it can also be used as a punitive means to bully midwives and is a powerful means of control, including on those who speak out for women, raise concerns or are seen as challenging the status quo. Statutory Supervision’s success is dependent on individual Supervisors of Midwives and Local Supervising Authority Midwifery Officers rather than the robustness of the system, therefore it cannot be relied on to be fit for purpose.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Unfortunately the NMC Fitness to Practise system depends on Supervisors of Midwives or Local Supervising Authority Midwifery Officers opinion as evidence in its investigations and hearings accepting it as</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">authoritive and failing to exercise due diligence it checking its robustness.
