The Understanding Walking and Cycling (UWAC</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">) project, a collaboration between the universities of Lancaster, Leeds and Oxford Brookes funded by the Economic and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) 2008-11, has examined the factors influencing everyday travel decisions and proposes a series o</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">f policy measures to increase levels of walking and cycling for short trips in urban areas.

These were chosen to reflect </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">a range of social characteristics, urban environments and existing interventions to promote active travel.  Two </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">separate questionnaire schedules were prepared, one focusing on walking and one on cycling. Questions were designed to collect data on the exper</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ience of and attitudes towards either walking or cycling and schedules were sent to a sample of households in all four study areas stratified using location and the index of multiple deprivation to produce a cross-section of the population. There was no at</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">tempt to specifically target walkers or cyclists.  15000 postal questionnaires were distributed evenly across the four areas with a response rate of almost 10% giving 1,417 usable returns (798 walking and 619 cycling). The sample of respondents was broadly</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> representative of the total population. Spatial analysis of the four case study towns consisted of detailed land-use mapping and identification of the network of all routes that could be used for walking and cycling (which can differ significantly from th</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">e road network). Multiple Centrality Analysis (MCA) was then used to assess connectivity within the city. Network buffers of 800 metres for walking and 2500 metres for cycling (roughly the average acceptable distance travelled over 10 minutes to access eve</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ryday activities) were developed and used to calculate local and global measures of connectivity as well as prevalence of everyday services within walking and cycling distance of the home. These indices could then be correlated with self-reported data on l</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">evels of walking and cycling provided by the questionnaire survey to assess the extent to which land use and connectivity influence levels of walking and cycling. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">4.3: </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">80 semi-structured interviews were undertaken with people selected (mainly) from their</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> questionnaire responses to be broadly representative of the population structure and travelling characteristics of the population of each of the four towns. 40 interviews were undertaken in households and probed attitudes to walking and cycling and the re</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">asons why people chose particular modes of travel, and 40 interviews were conducted as either walking or cycling ‘go-alongs’. Respondents were accompanied on a ‘usual’ journey and the interview focused on the motivations for travelling on foot or by bike, </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">on route selection and on the experience of the journey. Half of the mobile interviews were on foot and half were undertaken whilst cycling, and a small number of the cycle journeys were also recorded visually with a head cam. Household ethnographies were </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">undertaken with 20 households (5 in each town). In each urban area one location was selected – designed to reflect particular characteristics – and all respondents were recruited from that location. This allowed the researchers to immerse themselves in the</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> local community and begin to understand the ways in which people moved around. The purpose of the ethnography was to observe and understand the nature of everyday journeys within a community and this was done using a combination of research tools includin</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">g interviews, go-alongs, mobility inventories, observations, mapping exercises and community participation. The precise nature of the ethnographic research varied across the four districts in recognition of the need to engage different communities in parti</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">cular ways.

For most people there is no single factor that restricts the use of more sustainable travel modes, rather it is a combination of circumstances including the logistics of organising an</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">d moving with (sometimes tired) children, pressures of time and other commitments, the ready availability of the paraphernalia needed for and cycling and parental concerns about safety.

Our research makes clear that the extent to which a household finds it difficult to incorporate cycling journeys into its e</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">veryday routines reflects the degree to which car use has become normal, and habitual. We suggest that as walking and cycling are made more normal, more households will develop more strategies and systems to more easily accommodate walking and cycling into</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> their ordinary, everyday movements.
