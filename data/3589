How is this so?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 6pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Quite simply until it can be established to a criminal level of proof that an unregistered electricians work has hurt someone there is no impediment at all to them doing what</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> so ever they like. By way of confirming that assertion I recently used the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act to ask my Local Authority Building Control how many enforcements or prosecutions they have made under the auspices of Part P. None -in </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">7/8 years. Yet I routinely visit customers that have clearly had work done since the inception of Part P (it is easy to tell because the change in the colour of the insulation on British cables happened at more or less the same time) and ask whether they r</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">eceived testing paperwork or confirmation of self certification. It is a small minority who are certain that they did.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 6pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Therefore the effect of Part P is the precise reverse of that which was intended. It is a cost on the competent bona fide tradesman, and </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">is ignored by those who undertake work they are not entitled to do without 3</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:7.33pt; vertical-align:super">rd</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> party inspection. Human nature being what it is (especially in difficult economic times) domestic customers' chief concern is the price they will have to pay to get work done, n</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">ot the theoretical consequences of having the work done badly. In my opinion, next to no one finds an electrician through any individual scheme or either of the collective safety scheme web sites (the committee might like to ask the schemes for information</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> on this point?). Recognition and understanding of how Part P is administered is even more lacking than awareness of the existence of Part P itself, so these organisations are invisible. In order of importance electricians are commissioned through word of </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">mouth, direct advertising by the contractor, checkatrade et al, and google et al. By far the most important is word of mouth and for many the recommendation of a builder (who may have no understanding or interest in either the wiring regulations or Part P </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">and the complications of electrical work) is taken as “gospel”.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Therefore those working out with Part P CPS schemes entirely secure a competitive advantage (and if they are not in a Part P CPS why bother with having expensive calibrated test equipment, or </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">insurance, or a marked vehicle, further enhancing the advantage?).</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">This ripples on through the industry. As legitimate tradesmen become desperate to secure work they start cutting corners by not testing and registering jobs that should have been so registered and tested. They may simply make up test results, or 'forget' t</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">o issue paperwork and move on to the next job. As I argue above, since the great majority of the general public have no idea what they are entitled to expect by way paperwork from their electrician there is little come back. On the basis that one might as </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">well be “hung for a sheep as a lamb”, finding that once they break the rules nothing happens hitherto legitimate tradesmen in turn begin to 'bodgit  and scarper' themselves.

Its fundamental flaw is that the schemes must compete for members. Any one scheme therefore has no interest in tig</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">htening standards, as it will be at a competitive disadvantage to its peers. Similarly they are not concerned to police those that are not a member of any scheme. The schemes' interests lie in selling the unregistered membership. In this regard competition</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> drives standards down, as the the two key tools in persuading people to join scheme X rather than scheme Y is a) cost (but like all oligopolies the price of CPS membership is remarkably consistent at around £400 p.a. across all the schemes) and b) keeping</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> standards low so no one who applies fails their initial inspection.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 6pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">But this is not fundamentally the schemes' fault.

If it wants a a system of regulation that works to really improve safety, it must introduce a policing system that focuses on tho</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">se who try to avoid it, and not those trying to do their best within it. It must stop unregulated work by prosecuting those who do it regardless of whether the work was incompetent. It should prevent the sale of electrical disconnection equipment to anyone</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> who cannot produce a CPS scheme membership card.
