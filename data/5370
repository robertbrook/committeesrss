font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Thank you very much both for being here.  I remember a time when </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">one</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Government chief scientist said that food security was the biggest challenge that we face</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">an</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">other said that food security was the biggest challenge that we face.  In your view, which do you think is</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> the biggest challenge between those two that we face, and what do you think the relationship is between the two?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Benton</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: You said “food security” twice.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Global food security and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> food security.  I would say it is the competition between climate change and food security.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Benton</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is almost impossible to differentiate between the two, because the impacts of climate change are going to be felt by most people most of the time around access to food as probably a first approximation.  Clearly, there will be more floods, heat waves and so on, but, in terms of the impacts on everyday lives, we can buffer ourselves against the weather.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">However, the issue to do with the amount of food that the world can produce is quite frightening.  If you look ahead towards the middle of the century, although it is quite difficult to effectively produce a weather forecast that is accurate enough to understand what production is going to be like, under some scenarios of change, where the variability may increase detrimentally, it might be difficult even to produce the same number of calories as we do at the moment, yet alone the projected increase in demand of 100%.  Certainly, climate change is going to impact on food security.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">If there is enough food, broadly speaking, for 7 billion to 9 billion, and we have 9 billion or 10 billion, and the richest people want to eat twice the global share, what will end up happening?  Wars are likely to happen, for access to land and water, and food prices are going to detrimentally affect a whole range of different things, so together they are quite painful challenges.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Crute</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I would add that climate change is clearly happening, but in terms of an issue that is going to confront significant parts of the population, you could argue it is just a bit further out in terms of the sort of catastrophic consequences.  Food security issues, for the reasons that Tim has outlined, are very much closer in time.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q3 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> If we accept what food security is, what do you see as the greatest threats to both the medium-term and longer-term food security in this country, the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">?   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Crute</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: You have to look at food security at both a national and regional level—by that I am talking about northern Europe—and then the global level.  I do not think you can detach those things, because the global food system is so interconnected.  The question of interest is: what is the role of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United Kingdom</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in its response to imbalance in supply and demand of food at a global or regional level?  I would say the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has quite robust supply chains.  Tim will probably say more than me about the resilience of those supply chains, but we access food.  There is no shortage of food on our shelves at the moment, but the volatility in global food systems mean that the price volatility can impact on poor people.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Benton</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I fully agree with Ian.  It is very difficult to imagine divorcing the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> from global issues.  Price is going to be a major determinant of future access to food.  At the moment, with nominally 4 to 5 million people in food poverty in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and half a million people or so accessing food banks, food security is already an issue for us in terms of the nutritious side of the diet.  I would flag up that there is a very large difference between having </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">enough calories and having the right nutrition.  To a certain extent, the long-term impacts on the nutritional side are something we have under-thought about, but they are profound.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q4 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Professor Benton, you mentioned about diets changing.  As countries like </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">China</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> become more prosperous, are they possibly going to cause an imbalance if they take more of our food?  Might they create shortages elsewhere?   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Benton</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Absolutely.  You can certainly see, with respect to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">China</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, the dietary transition has been huge over the last 25 years or so, and the amount of meat and dairy that is being consumed has gone up about fivefold per capita.  The end result of that is they are importing, for example, huge amounts of soy from </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">South America</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.  We also rely on soy, primarily for putting in processed foods—about 70% of foods in the supermarket have soy in—and for most livestock food.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">If China, which economically is clearly growing in power, cordons more of the market—and we rely on an open market more than they do, because they have been quite canny, in a sense, about getting tight trade relationships and land grabbing issues that everybody has heard about—in a sense, the rest of the world is fighting over what China does not want.  There is an issue there that, if </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">China</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> decides that it needs more food, prices are likely to go up.  We have to think more from a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> perspective about the potential perturbations on the market for things that we want or need, like cattle feed.  We need a plan B for protein and where it comes from.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Crute</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: That makes the point that it is not just a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> issue; it is a European issue.  Europe has become essentially dependent on South American protein sources, and we need policy redirection to ensure that we can take account of the eventuality where you may have a bilateral trade agreement between </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Brazil</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">China</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> that cuts us out of the market.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Fracking</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is very much in the news, and we are told that the deep-well </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">fracking</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> involved will take a lot of water.  We do not yet know what the abstraction policy of this country is going to be.  Do you envisage a situation where water that would otherwise have gone to farming or industrial purposes might be—I am thinking of my own area of Yorkshire, with which perhaps you are more familiar, Professor Benton, than Professor </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Crute</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—diverted away from farm production?  I am thinking in times of drought; I do not think it will be an issue this year.  Might that be a problem?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Crute</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I am not sure that I can talk specifically about the demand on water for </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">fracking</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in an authoritative way, although it obviously is there.  However, you have put your finger on something that is of significance—that we do not have as much clarity as we need to have about a regional water demand for agriculture, as distinct from urban and other uses or industrial uses, and the partitioning of that water.  To some extent, it is not only the spatial, but the temporal partitioning of that, in that demand for water in agriculture is seasonal depending on rainfall, and that can often coincide with other requirements.  You have put your finger on something that is an important area of policy.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Benton</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: In the east and south-east especially, there is a significant risk of not having enough water for whatever purposes and the extra burden from a new industrial source, like </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">fracking</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, could be quite detrimental.  Clearly, the answer is, people would say, you just need to build more reservoirs to store the water that comes in winter, but that raises a whole host of issues.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We will not go there because we will get into all sorts of difficulties.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Spencer:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Is there a European equivalent of American soya to replace the protein in those animal and human diets?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Crute</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There was quite a bit of soy grown in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Romania</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and it still is, but the yields in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Romania</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> have gone down since </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Romania</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> joined the EU and was not able to use the GM soya they were previously using.  So I guess the quantities are smaller.  Some people would argue that cereal protein, particularly through the processing of cereal grain into ethanol and the dry distillers’ grain protein from that process, would potentially fill the gap.  However, there are then issues about the nutritional quality of that protein, which would need to be taken account of.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The answer is it comes down to one of those things where the sums need to be done in terms of quantity and alternative uses for land.  It comes down, ultimately, to how land is used, because we would probably have to devote more land to cereal production if that was going to be a source of protein.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There are issues about what the knock-on effects of the land use change would be.  Soya is such a convenient source, because soya beans are about 46% protein, whereas wheat is maybe 12% to 14% protein—you need an awful lot more land per kilogram of protein.  It is a land use issue that has to be thought of.  People talk about sustainability;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">To go back to the horsemeat issue, one of the things about our current business model is that, effectively, we have pushed food prices all the way down, and food is relatively cheap from a historical perspective.  We tend to over-buy, over</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The thing about very cheap food is that you tend to have more complexity in the supply chain, which is one of the constituent things of the horsemeat affair.  Those two things together, the resilience of the supply chain and the length of the supply chain, mean that it might be more difficult in future to source the things that we want and are used to sourcing at the price that we can afford.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The other important area is that of capacity that exists now within the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> for research provision and training in the specialist scientific and technical area where, to some extent, for the last 20 years or so, we have done a great job in terms of ploughing forward with scientific advance in genomics or what have you.  However, in reality, we now have to start seeing some of that translated and applied.  A lot of the skills base for the application and translation of science into practice has been eroded.  That is another area of concern in terms of making sure that we have the right response.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">“</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Right</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> to food” is an important concept, but it is very difficult to translate that concept into a reality in a market-driven environment.  The most important way of doing that is to ensure the safety net is appropriately secure for those people, whether in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> or elsewhere.  As we have been talking about, price volatility will always impact hardest on people living in urban environments and the poorest people living in those working environments, which, thinking about the issue of security, is always likely to bring about civil unrest and disturbance.  “Right to food” is an important concept in terms of ensuring that that is recognised.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Benton</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: To add to that, the issues around food sovereignty are the most easy to translate into everyday life in developing world systems where you still have a largely agrarian-based economy.  It is much more difficult to see how, given we import so much of the food that we eat, we can be responsible for our food systems on a personal basis in the same way.  The UK level at which food sovereignty is perhaps most important is thinking about the localism agenda, in terms of where our food comes from and the choices that consumers have to source things from short supply chains that are locally produced.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Ultimately, it is an economic argument.  If you want to do that, it is likely to come at a cost, and if you are willing to pay the cost, supermarkets and the food system will respond to that.  As I put in my evidence, given that we do import food, making sure that, if the market fails for whatever reason, we have a diversity of products that are produced in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is perhaps a benefit in thinking about resilience into the future.  That would imply that more of our food, potentially, would come from shorter supply chains than in the past.  There is potentially a mapping, as we move into a more variable world, that we might want to produce more food locally as a bet hedge </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">against the market breaking down, which will then translate into more people feeling they are controlling their local choices.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond;

it has hastened the view of the retailer and probably the manufacturer as well.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt;

font-size:12pt"> Can I go back, Professor Benton, to the answer you gave to Mrs Lewell-Buck about the issues between domestic and imported?  You made a very important point with that, in terms of resilience and being able to have local supply, especially in seasonally-produced foods, which historically there always was.  Now, because we can scope it from anywhere on the planet, almost, how do we assure ourselves that there will be locally-produced food?  If we could be buying it from elsewhere for a number of years, it could turn off the supply.  How do we ensure that UK-produced food is still being produced?  Do we interfere in the market?  Do we promote it as politicians and Government?  Do we try and influence supermarkets to stock it?  How do we ensure that it continues to be grown?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Benton</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There is an element of all of those.  The popularisation of the locally-produced agenda certainly is changing attitudes.  There are issues around planning and support for diversification.  For example, one of the places that I absolutely love, following a visit there, is the big greenhouse complex, Thanet Earth, in Thanet, which produces about a third of our cucumbers and tomatoes on an annual basis.  That, effectively, is taking some land, putting it indoors under a big greenhouse. The computer-controlled irrigation system is really efficient, and is producing local fruit and vegetables at a price that is competitive with the rest of the market, but it is local.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Some of the issues there are, for communities like around Thanet, what are the incentives to embrace all those sorts of things?  Going back, my grandparents lived on the south coast in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Chichester</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, and many, many years ago there was a very large horticultural area and lots of greenhouses.  They went by the board, and now getting planning permission to put greenhouses back is quite difficult.  There are issues there.  Then there are always going to be some regulatory issues.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Going back to the Thanet Earth thing, they told me that they could not use the same pest-control products as the sister organisation across the seas in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Holland</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, so they were at a slight disadvantage.  It was something to do with the way that the regulations were administered at the national level.  So there are things around the national view of European regulations that make the playing field not always as level as we would want.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There is potential there, but also there is a lot of scope for innovation in this space.  Stockbridge Technology Centre, which is up near </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">York</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, has this super-insulated block house, which could be a cellar, underground, or in the town, where it is growing things, instead of in a greenhouse, with LED lights and tuning the LED lights.  You can imagine systems where we encourage much more urban or novel production, especially in fruit and vegetables—stuff that we are probably quite short of.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

in other areas we are probably less efficient.  The EU market is the primary determinant, unless you are talking about exotic products brought in from further afield.  With things like cereals, there is a huge global market subject to a lot of fluctuations, which ultimately impacts heavily on the price of livestock products as well, simply because a lot of that grain is used for livestock production.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">Spratt</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.  Effectively, he points out in there that, because there is natural variability in the agricultural markets driven by climate, financial speculation, which thrives on variability, has increased rapidly.  It has gone up from about 10% in 1998 to about 60% of the finance that goes into the market being speculative.  That has some sort of impact on the markets—quite how big, no one knows.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The other thing that drives the market, certainly for cereals, is input prices.  Inputs such as nitrogen fertilisers are very energy intensive, so there is a link between input prices and oil prices.  Therefore, as oil prices go up, food prices go up as well.  As Ian said, it is a hugely complex thing, but it is not just simple supply and demand.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

it does not work like that and the benefit of forward buying is the main thing.  But, because of that nature of the forward buying, as opposed to the speculation, which is very short term—buys and sells—it is probably prone to price volatility from speculation.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

therefore you might say those input prices then affect the price of grain.  Another way of looking at that—and I am not saying this is definitely the case; it is a hypothesis—is, in reality, very little oil is used in the manufacture of fertiliser.  Oil is the major determinant.  Fertiliser is mostly manufactured from natural gas.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Actually, natural gas prices are not necessarily following oil prices.  What potentially could be happening is that, as grain prices lift, fertiliser manufacturers recognise that farmers have a bigger margin and therefore track the price of grain, rather than their own costs.  That is a hypothesis, not a fact, but it is saying that you cannot always say that there is cause and effect when there is correlation.  Correlation can have a number of different origins.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

they went and paid whatever price they had to pay.  That brings the question of, in terms of flapping out volatility, adequate stocks and knowing there are adequate stocks globally is an important contribution to that.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

and also investing more in longer-term relationships with suppliers.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The history has been that suppliers have supplied with relatively short-term relationships, always on the assumption that the supermarket, if it does not like that supplier, will find another one.  Increasingly, that is not the case.  So the supply chain is having to invest deeper in the sustainability of individual relationships with suppliers.  They are becoming more sustainable.  They are becoming more climate adapted, so they will be able to produce a whole range of different things.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

it is about the resilience of the food we bring in, not just chocolate, cocoa and soya but all the other things that we bring in.  It is also about buying sufficient food, not overbuying food and throwing it away, and buying sufficient food for a healthy diet and not overeating food and wasting it in that way.  There are many ways in which we can increase our ability to cope with problems of production, and they are not all about growing more in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

resources are really important and you should get as much as you possibly can, because under those circumstances you can use those other resources, whether it is land, water or energy, for other purposes.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The term tends to come into focus on things like conserving biodiversity where, if you are using less land for production, it allows you to spare land for forests, biodiversity, amenity or recreational uses.  If you have to plough every last piece of land in order to produce food, and you are doing it inefficiently, you are losing the opportunity for environmental benefit.  That is the concept.  It is effectively using land, which is the best land, to be as productive as possible, and that leaves you options for use of land in other ways.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">but being able to provide food to generations to come.  Certainly around soils, which are something that I often talk about, if we carry on eroding soils at the rate that we are eroding them, eventually functionality will go down.  Then there is practically nothing you cannot do about it.  I cannot imagine a global agricultural system without soil.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-weight:bold">Crute</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Livestock on productive lowland pastures is essentially there to produce protein.  We need protein in the diet.  They are primarily going to be grass fed, so if you were going to measure just joules of energy, you might be right; it would be appropriate possibly to produce carbohydrate and cereal on that land, assuming the soils were right and all the other things are correct.  But if you are interested in producing protein for the diet, production of livestock in those areas is probably appropriate.  You have to pose the question: what is it that you are trying to produce?  You cannot just generalise it in terms of one system being more efficient than another.  It has to be determined by what you are trying to get out of the land.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Benton</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I would take a slightly different view from Ian’s again, although we are good friends, of course.  There is an issue that the carbon footprint and the broad metric footprint of meat production are quite high.  There is an interesting statistic, which I will qualify in a moment—it is a calculation by an American NGO—that states that, if every family in America ate one beef burger less a week, it would save the equivalent of 91 billion car</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The caveat is that some areas of land are best for production of livestock.  Certainly, low level grazing in the uplands is producing food that we can consume, but we would not produce any other food stock up there.  If it is low level grazing, it is a perfectly rational thing to do.  If you have very highly productive grassland, it is probably more efficient to grow the grain for human consumption, rather than for cattle consumption or </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">bioethanol</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> consumption.  If you look at our overall health statistics, the recommendation is that we eat 500-700 grams of wet red meat a week, and across </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> we eat about three times that.  By changing the diet, it can radically change land use and sustainability statistics.  In the long run, changing the diet is a possibility.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt">could have been put over to cropping.  For the most part, you are talking about livestock production on soils, whether in the lowlands or uplands, where the best use of that land is improved pasture or semi-permanent pasture.  Essentially they would be inappropriate, either because of slope or soil type, for grain or crop production.  The simple economics of it are that, these days, anybody who has land that is anything like appropriate for cereal production is likely to be producing cereal.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

some of it is probably an investment issue, in terms of upgrading our capacity whether in terms of farm livestock and housing or equipment.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Spencer:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Correct me if I am wrong, but what I am hearing is that there are several ways to increase, if you like, productivity: either looking at scale and efficiency or pushing up yields, both of which, I presume, would mean an increased carbon footprint, in effect.  If you have larger machinery travelling greater distances and if you want to push yields up with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">fertilisers and agricultural chemicals, both of them have a fairly high carbon footprint.  How are we going to get to this panacea of intensification without being unsustainable?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-weight:bold">Crute</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Let us tease some of those points out that you make there.  On the one hand, you have the genetic potential of, let us say, the livestock or the crop.  To some extent, then, one route to increasing productivity is something to do with increasing the genetic potential.  Of course, animal-breeding companies as well as plant-breeding companies are doing that.  That is in terms of your environmental impact, impact-neutral, unless you need to drive that productivity through greater impacts; in most cases, you would not.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The other side of that equation is then to realise that genetic potential.  You have increased the genetic potential and you want to realise that genetic potential; sometimes, that might require you to put more resources in to realise that potential, but your output, as measured, say, in terms of greenhouse gases per kilogram of protein or per kilogram of grain produced, may be less—in other words, per unit of production, you may have much less of a footprint.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The third dimension of that interaction is, indeed, your environmental impact.  In some senses what we are trying to do through the question that was asked about sustainable intensification is look at those interactions—in other words, elevating genetic potential and ensuring that the practices used, whether in rearing livestock or crop production, are efficient.  To some extent, your output per unit of environmental impact is reduced, and that environmental impact can, of course, be measured in different ways, depending on where you are.  If you are in a water-deficient situation, you might be most concerned about your water use; if you are talking about greenhouse-gas emissions, they might be your unit.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">This is where understanding better the science of sustainability surrounding production systems and understanding how you optimise those things is really at the nub of sustainable intensification.  It is not necessarily the case that, simply by increasing your productivity or increasing your production, you are necessarily increasing your environmental impact.  Sometimes, it is absolutely the opposite.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Benton</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Just to add to that, we also have the situation that the environment provides so many different services, and they are all wrapped up in sustainability, but working on a piece of land affects carbon, biodiversity, the look of the landscape, the water-flows, flood risk, water quality and the ability to use water and so on.  Many of those services are valued by people but they are not </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">costed</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> by people, whereas the economics of production on a farm has a clear financial benefit to the farmer.  Part of the issue here is how to get the most out of your land in a way that is sustainable and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

We need, in a way, to start reconnecting livestock-production systems and arable systems, not by recreating the traditional mixed farm, although that clearly had its advantages, but thinking about the juxtaposition of production systems that allow us access to sufficient organic matter and so to restore soils.  Of course, some thought is going into that but it is a major issue about how we reconfigure agriculture looking forward.  It does come back to what I was saying earlier about the whole area of land use and the optimisation of land use.  This is another aspect of that optimisation.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

temperature, which we know something about; and water.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">At the end of the day, what does not change is irradiation and latitude in terms of day length and rate of change of day length.  Plant and crop development is very determined by latitude, so it is not going to be just a simple matter of moving genotypes of crops from the south to the north to adapt to temperature and to water relations, because these interactions of these variables have never been seen before, and we could not go anywhere on the planet to get this combination of these variables.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;
