However, many patients with long-term conditions will need to be admitted to hospital for other reasons as part of their care, and it is vital that there is coordination between primary and secondary care so that patients are able to access all the devices and other treatments in hospital which they use during their normal day-to-day life.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">13. </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">As alluded to above, one problem which is often experienced is the tendency for those in charge of commissioning care to think about issues in isolation, rather than </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">as a</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> whole.
