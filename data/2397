Home dialysis is more </span><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">affordable, yet offers better medical and personal outcomes than dialysis in hospitals and stand alone centres. However, undertaking therapy at home requires additional space and traditionally spare bedrooms have been used. The recent changes in benefits h</span><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">ave highlighted the issue of penalising people who undertake treatment at home.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">Background</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">1) People with kidney failure need long term treatment in the form of either dialysis or transplantation. At the beginning of 2012, 53207 adults received replaceme</span><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">nt therapy, of which 26910 were on dialysis (UK Renal Registry Report 2012). For an individual on dialysis, the tre</span><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">atment is required on a regular basis several times a week. There are two forms of dialysis – haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">2) Hae</span><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">modialysis requires treatment a minimum of three times per week. The individual is attached to a dialysis monitor that enables blood to be removed and 'cleaned' through a filter before being returned to the patient. A dialysis session can last from 4 hours</span><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt"> up to 8 hours, during which time the individual is attached to the system. The machine is about the size of a domestic fridge, requires electricity and purified water and the treatment uses disposal filters and plastic tubing.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">3) Peritoneal dialysis (PD)</span><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt"> involves therapy everyday. Fluid is drained into the abdomen via a permanently positioned plastic catheter. After a period of time, the fluid is drained off and fresh fluid instilled. This treatment may be carried out by hand (generally by the patient or </span><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">a carer) four time a day, using bags that contain 2 litres of fluid, or via an automated machine that runs overnight, using 5 litre bags. In both case, there is a need to store large quantities of fluid and other equipment.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">4) PD is traditionally carried </span><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">out in the home. Within the UK 3831 people use this system. It is convenient, safe and effective. It also allows individuals to continue a much higher level of independence, including working, education and holiday travel.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">5) In contrast, the majority of </span><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">haemodialysis (HD) is carried out in centres dedicated to dialysis. In the UK 23079 people undertake HD. They need to travel to units three times a week (haemodialysis patients travel about 40 million miles per year across the UK), often at times inconveni</span><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">ent to them. It reduces the opportunity for education and employment and only limited opportunities to go on holiday. However, in recent years, patients have been offered the opportunity to have HD at home. In the last registry report 905 patients were at </span><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">home. It allows those individuals to have greater flexibility, much less wasted travel time and also the ability to undertake more treatment that results in better outcomes. For example, people using haemodialysis at night (nocturnal HD) for 5-6 sessions p</span><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">er week have a survival equivalent to that of having a kidney transplant.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">6) However, to take advantage of both of these home based treatments, the individual needs space – a dedicated room to undertake the treatment, with the correct equipment, in a clea</span><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">n safe environment and the ability to store equipment and consumables. Many dialysis patients require rehousing into funded accommodation and in the past specific renal social workers have made the case for extra rooms for this purpose. It is important to </span><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">realises that social deprivation is relatively high in the dialysis population and so housing needs are high.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">7) This is on the background of the need to increase the proportion of people who have dialysis at home. This is a core fundamental of NHS </span><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">England strategy to engage patients and carers, provide them with holistic solutions and to improve quality whilst containing cost. Currently, less than 20% have dialysis at home with a need to increase that proportion to 30%. The direct UK dialysis health</span><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt"> costs is close to £1 billion pounds, but does not take into account admissions, drugs and transportation. It is therefore important that the social context of home based dialysis therapies are considered. If a patient moves to HD from PD, the therapy bill</span><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt"> increases by £100 per week and the cost of hospital transport is also incurred (£40-80 per week).</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">8) With the recent welfare reforms patient groups have been increasingly reporting that patients on home based dialysis have benefit reductions instituted. </span><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">A number of case studies are enclosed. The situation across the country remains patchy though. In some areas no adjustments have been made whilst in others temporary support via</span><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">discretionary housing benefit has been offered. The latter response is welcome</span><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt"> but it is only temporary. Unless someone receives a transplant, dies or moves to in centre haemodialysis the situation is unresolved.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">9) On behalf of NHS England, I would ask that consideration be given to this group of individuals as worthy of exemption</span><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt"> from aspects of the welfare reforms. The desire to restore a degree of independence and a willingness to undertake complex therapy should not be penalised. As a system, we need to encourage more people to </span><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">have dialysis at home and I have concerns that thi</span><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">s will have a negative impact on that aspiration.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><br style="page-break-before:always; clear:both" /></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">Case studies</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt; text-decoration:underline">Report from Preston social worker</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">MR W</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">Lives with wife and 3 school age children</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">He lost his house and business (was B and B owner) and was declared bankrupt (had home haemodialysis).</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">I s</span><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">upported him with housing and liaised with housing department for rehousing.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">Family was offered a house with one extra bedroom to facilitate home haemodialysis.
