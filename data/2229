The Alliance would caution against taking a narrow view of ‘sport’ and therefore neglecting the huge contribution that organisations and activities such as outdoor pursuits, walking and dance can play in establishing and sustaining healthy and active lifestyles alongside the role of a full range of sports. A key obstacle to participation is the lack of appropriate and attractive choices (or a lack of awareness of these options) and a wide range of sporting activity, including adaptations to the way to sport is delivered, will help in driving higher participation rates.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">1.3 The Alliance welcomes the opportunity to respond to this timely consultation. There remain significant challenges for women’s sport in the UK in terms of participation levels, funding and coverage. The cross party consensus on the need to act, and the focus of the Committee on this subject in the promising climate that London 2012 has created means that there is the potential to make real progress on this issue in the coming months and years. As an overarching comment, this inquiry is very ambitious in scope and it would be worth the Committee revisiting a number of these issues in more detail than these responses and evidence sessions will allow. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">1.4 It is also important to acknowledge the commitment of National Governing Bodies of sport (NGBs) and Sport England to promote women’s sport, and some examples of existing good practice are included in this response. In an effort to remain within a strict word limit, these comprise a very limited number of case studies amongst a wide range of impressive work. The sport and recreation sector is committed to playing its full role in ensuring that women and girls have as many as opportunities as possible to participate in and enjoy sport. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">2.

However, the extent to which they can be solved by government alone is limited and there is a need for a period of as much stability and consistency as possible in the framework of government policy to ensure that NGBs are not unnecessarily distracted and are able to concentrate fully on the </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">shared goal of increased female participation. Government should recognise and champion the extensive existing good practice across sport and recreation. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">2.2 There are several areas in which government can either play a direct role, or be helpful in facilitating outside efforts. For example, the Government has some important levers at its disposal, through which it can play an important role in supporting, co-ordinating and funding activity across the sports sector as well as highlighting good practice and working closely with NGBs and other organisations in the sector to increase levels of participation by women.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">2.3 Appropriate facilities constitute a pre-requisite to increasing participation but are not the solution to these challenges in isolation.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">2.4 The disparity in finance and investment between men’s and women’s sport is an obstacle to promoting women’s sport more widely and government has a valuable role in brokering and facilitating dialogue. Moreover, the equitable investment of Exchequer and Lottery funds should be closely monitored.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">2.5 Greater media coverage would have many benefits, including the development of new role models, the inspirational potential of more people watching women’s sport and the increased attractiveness of commercial investment. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">2.6 There are existing expectations that NGBs will involve more women in the leadership of sport.

Availability of facilities for training and playing sport, for both girls and women, at both elite and grassroots levels</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">3.1 The availability of high quality, accessible facilities is clearly essential to maintain and increase the levels of sporting participation. There are therefore some clear concerns about the potential impact of funding reductions on the quality and availability of training and other sporting facilities. Sporting infrastructure at all levels often finds itself operating at, or beyond, capacity and so further investment to maintain and expand facilities will be important if further </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">participation is to become a reality. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that the times available to women’s clubs and associations are less attractive, and that women can face obstructive and unhelpful attitudes in accessing facilities. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">3.2 The early findings of the 2013 sports club survey, conducted by the Alliance, reveal a number of trends. Many of the key indicators, particularly membership numbers, are positive, but there remain concerns, including around the increased running costs and a lack of affordable venues or facilities. The 2013 survey also demonstrates the ongoing importance of local authority facilities with 38% hiring or leasing council facilities</span><a name="_ftnref1"></a><a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">3.3 Sports clubs should be at the heart of efforts to drive up participation – meaning that any reductions in local funding must be carefully planned and managed to ensure that the unintended consequence is not an additional barrier.  The inability to invest in facilities, including in making clubs more attractive to under-represented groups, including women, is likely to limit the potential to increase participation. It is further likely to lead to frustration if potential new participants are unable to find appropriate participation opportunities and latent demand will not permanently remain in the system. In other words, a mismatch between the potential supply and demand of appropriate opportunities may lead to people being ‘put off’ sport and recreation altogether and lead to them being hard to recapture. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">3.4 Facilities are a necessary pre-requisite to harnessing the potential of higher rates of female participation, but will not solve these significant challenges in isolation. Planning guidance has improved significantly with transport, lighting, childcare and other considerations much more visible. However, further progress on the culture and accessibility of sport coupled with appropriate coaching and support is the key to driving participation. Support for facilities by government, including investment where appropriate should largely be seen in the context of securing sporting opportunities for all, as a result of which women would clearly benefit alongside men. There are, however, a number of actions that the sport and recreation sector is taking to ensure that facilities are appropriate, for example the Football Foundation ensures that facilities are appropriate to both men and women as a condition of funding. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">3.5 In terms of elite sport, talent identification and athlete pathways must become as well developed for women as they are for men. Each sport, building on its participation base, must have suitably skilled coaches (who also understand the differences in coaching men and women), as well as sports science and medicine appropriate to women. These are the fundamentals known to underpin future success. This is important not only as a policy objective </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">in itself, but also in the context of the role that elite sportswomen play as role models to inspire participation and confidence.

Low levels of visibility mean that women are less likely to gain exposure to potential role models, and may further reinforce the perception that sport is primarily played by, watched by and ‘for’ men. The current low levels of coverage are also likely to be limiting the commercial attractiveness of women’s sport and so greater coverage may in itself deliver benefits in attracting greater sponsorship and investment. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">5.2 The UK is not alone in trying to address perceptions that women’s sport holds less value</span><a name="_ftnref4"></a><a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> and organisations such as the Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation (WSFF) have produced evidence that demand exists.

This underlines the value of new media in the absence of traditional platforms and, whilst sports governing bodies are beginning to understand this potential, increasing their awareness and capacity to capitalise should be a focus over the coming years. There has been some progress – including significant recent coverage of the 2013 Women’s European Football Championships and a renewed focus on women’s sport by major broadcasters including the BBC, ESPN and BT Sport. Much of the progress to date is due to higher political profile and campaigning about the importance of women’s sport. The Olympic and Paralympic Games also provided an unprecedented opportunity for women’s sport, with a number of the iconic events of London 2012 featuring women’s sport very prominently. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">5.4 It is regrettable that the widely covered instances of sexist remarks by high profile commentators across a range of sports may have done damage to the considerable efforts of NGBs and the wider sector to promote women’s sport and these should be dealt with promptly and robustly. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Recommendations</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">The </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">media,</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold"> and the BBC in particular, should be encouraged and supported to provide greater profile and visibility for women’s sport.</span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Education and guidance should be made available to sports in order to broaden the media platforms through which they can promote women’s sport. </span></li></ul><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">6.

A lack of female role models has been an obstacle to inspiring more young women and girls to take up and continue playing sport. This is hopefully set to change, with a number of high profile successful female role models in a range of sports and with the legacy of London 2012 offering a particular boost. Nevertheless, this remains a challenge with research conducted in 2012 by Girlguiding UK showing that the lower profile of women’s sport has a real impact, with those surveyed often struggling to cite female role </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">models.

This would indicate a range of practical and attitudinal barriers, many of which could be tackled through the development and support of more flexible delivery models, and through changes to school sport where the benefits of sport and exercise to healthy lifestyles and well-being are well understood. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">7.3 Girlguiding UK’s Advocates, comprised of a panel of young women aged 15-24, have made a series of significant observations and recommendations, with some worrying trends around the lack of exercise as a central element of a healthy lifestyle, and a lack of confidence and sense that sport is an appropriate activity for women:</span></p><ol type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.25pt; padding-left:4.75pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">The definition of being healthy amongst girls tends to revolve around diet with relatively little emphasis placed on exercise, with this trend exacerbated amongst older groups. </span></li><li style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.25pt; padding-left:4.75pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Young women are not encouraged enough to play sport and many are not confident about their abilities.

Beyond choice, the quality of teaching is important. Some 45% of primary school teachers do not currently feel comfortable in delivering the PE curriculum effectively, and there is a significant danger that young girls stand to lose out particularly given that participation rates are already lower and that this is a vital stage of establishing physical literacy.</span><a name="_ftnref11"></a><a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> To ensure that high quality provision is delivered there could be clarified role for Ofsted in inspecting the quality and suitability of school sport provision and we would suggest a particular focus on ensuring high quality provision for girls at school.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">8.2 Competitive sport is, of course, an essential element of the teaching and enjoyment of sport at school. Many vital skills including teamwork, determination and the ability to react appropriately when things do not go according to plan can come from competitive sport. However, competitive sport is off putting for many young people, particularly young women and competitive sport alone will not therefore deliver on ambitions to see radical and sustained increases in female participation. As a minimum, the Government should recognise and understand the vital wider role than non-competitive sport and exercise should play and carefully consider what an emphasis on competition means for those who are uncomfortable </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">with it, or indeed for sports and recreational activities where competition may not be of relevance. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">8.3 An approach which fulfils this aim should result in a balanced offer of competitive and non-competitive activities; including activities such as dance, fitness and outdoor pursuits. This range is important to ensure that school sport is as inclusive as possible. A survey conducted by WSFF found that over half of girls at secondary school say that “girls are put off sport and physical activity because of their experiences of school sport and PE”</span><a name="_ftnref12"></a><a href="#_ftn12">[12]</a><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">.
