Drawing on then current research, he set out some of what the public wanted, including “to be able to identify the candidates and the issues; to have the issues clearly and interestingly explained; to know where the parties stand with respect to the issues, and how their stands are likely to affect him.” Presciently, he continued: “If you ask him whether he knows where to get what he wants, he will tell you: in direct confrontation. The voter wants to see the candidates in action under stress, responding to challenge. He wants ‘debates’.”</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="4" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.11pt; padding-left:3.89pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">How to achieve these objectives troubled Katz but it was obvious to him that political leaders be placed in the spotlight, that they should be interrogated by ‘impartial’ commentators  - “the intervention of the professional broadcaster” – and that the public should, in some way, be brought into the conversation. [Perhaps the use of the paper’s title of ‘platforms and windows’ is no longer apt in the digital age since it is too suggestive of the public playing the role of spectators. It does not fully capture the spirit of engagement – digitally or otherwise – that may be more of a requirement today.]</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="5" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.11pt; padding-left:3.89pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">These considerations should continue to be central to all contemporary discussions of how best to serve the public. They were of importance in the construction of the formats for the 2010 debates and they should be centre stage for the 2015 debates. Indeed, if Katz’s paper has a purchase on today’s events and the House of Lords’ inquiry it is because it places the viewer/ citizen at the heart of the discussion and it is argues for formats to be designed with the public’s interests paramount in the minds of those charged to do so.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="6" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.11pt; padding-left:3.89pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">If we take our starting point the centrality of the public interest in discussions about the 2015 ‘debates’, a number of things immediately follow on from this: </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="7" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.11pt; padding-left:3.89pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">First, that they </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">should</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> take place and that the political parties should not have the power or the opportunity to prevent them from taking place. If the aim is to create vehicles of communication to serve and enlighten the public, political parties should acknowledge their subservience to this greater ‘good’ and give up their powers of veto.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="8" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.11pt; padding-left:3.89pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Second, that rules must be agreed to ensure that all major contestants are treated ‘fairly’. Interestingly, in 1972 Katz also noted that the Liberal Party – as it was then – complicated the British political landscape when it came to considerations of ‘debates’ and it continues to do so, but it should not be outside the imagination of a group of people charged with the task of creating appropriate formats to devise a ‘fair’ formula. Whether this should be a newly established body of ‘the great and the good’ or a group of broadcasters and politicians (as essentially now) may be of little import if it is accepted that the discussion is merely about the how and not anything else. Drawing on </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Ric</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> Bailey’s account</span><a name="_ftnref2"></a><a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> and some current reports in the press, it does appear that primary considerations to date have been about either political parties gaining advantage or not losing out. The focus should be on how to serve the public and not about sectional political party interests. This might sound naïve but if the political establishment wishes to gain the trust and confidence of the public, it needs to show some humility and acknowledge its part in its own downfall.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="9" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.11pt; padding-left:3.89pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Third, </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">the success of the 2010 debates suggests that there is an appetite for seeing the leaders of the political parties in a format where they answer questions posed by others, including political rivals. Such a format fulfils a number of objectives from seeing the leaders ‘in action’ to examining their abilities to deal with controversial topics and, more generally, to set out their ambitions and visions for the country. As a minimum, then, it is important to design a format where the leaders appear and are given opportunities to speak unchallenged but where they are also subsequently challenged. The format in 2010 allowed much of this to take place. It might be possible to tweak elements, for example, giving extra time for an introduction or more time for questions from ‘impartial’ commentators or members of the public, but the basic principle of leaders on stage remains a good one. It allows for comparisons in a way that single interview programmes do not and in an age of comparison sites, the prospect of a </span><a href="http://www.comparetheleaders.com"><span style="color:#0000ff; font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; text-decoration:underline">www.comparetheleaders.com</span></a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> is not without merit.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="10" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Fourth, as in the past the real problems relate to the questions of inclusion and exclusion: who to include in the debates and, conversely, who to </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">exclude? Should the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">LibDems</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> be included as a separate entity from the Conservative Party and, if so, on what grounds? What of UKIP or the Green Party? Decisions regarding the allocation of time for political broadcasts have always been based on many considerations, including the numbers of candidates standing and past election </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">results,</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> and it should be possible to do the same in this case. As there are likely to be many possibilities and as whatever compromise is reached will inevitably displease someone, the guiding principle should be – as above – what does the public see as desirable? An educated guess would be that they would like to see the three main party leaders, as in 2010, but also others [possibly UKIP if the European Parliament election results are in their </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">favour</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">]. It may also be the case that the public really does not care about these [tactical] questions as long as they can get the debates. Another way of resolving this question is to look at it from the point of view of the ‘ordinary’ voter. He/she would most probably want to see those party leaders who dominate media coverage and the political agenda – Cameron, </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Miliband</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">, Clegg, </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Farage</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> – and if they are dominant in the media, why should there be any doubts about their presence in debates? One could, therefore, create two events with the three main party leaders and a third with all the leaders, including of UKIP, focusing on the single topic of Europe. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="11" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Fifth, as it is unlikely that any one submission would contain a template for setting out the arrangements for the debates, specific questions about arrangements may not be worth dealing with here at length. However, it is probable that three debates across the three- or four-week election period is a sensible figure. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Fewer than three would not allow leaders to ‘recover’ from ‘disasters’ or ‘confirm’ their superiority. More than three seems excessive (given also that there will be other election broadcasting / communication during the period).</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="12" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Sixth, as for location, the debates could be held almost anywhere though there has been a tendency to seek to ‘represent’ the regions. So, London (once), Manchester (once) Birmingham (once) seems sensible but there are clear alternatives, say, Newcastle or somewhere in the South West. In a way it does not matter since the audience is most likely to be selected in a representative way, in which case regional differences may make little difference. More challenging would be the selection of an audience based on particular interest, e.g. the young, the unemployed, the ‘grey’ vote, and so on.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="13" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Seventh, national public service broadcasters, especially the BBC, should produce and broadcast these but not exclusively so.  It is not about them but about the public and the requirements of meeting the needs and interests of the public. The addition of Sky and ITV should therefore be welcomed.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="14" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Lastly, how should the public play a greater part in this process? It is usual to offer opportunities for members of the public to pose questions. What might </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">be more challenging would be to offer those members of the public who might be granted the opportunity to ask questions to be given the chance to research their questions before posing them. This would give them material for supplementary questions if the need arises. So, instead of ‘professionals’ testing leaders informed citizens could play that role.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="15" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The above are merely suggestions but they are underpinned by on-going considerations relating to the role of the public in the processes of political communication. Indeed, they place the public at the heart of the discussions that will need to take place. At a time when disenchantment with the world of formal politics is high, it is crucial that the political parties engage with the public in an intelligent way.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Ends.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">13 January 2014 </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><div style="width:auto; height:auto; float:right;"><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">4</span></p></div><p style="margin:0pt 18pt 0pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div><hr style="width:33%; height:1px; text-align:left" /><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-36pt"><a name="_ftn1"></a><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:9pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:9pt">Elihu</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:9pt"> Katz, “Platform and Windows: Broadcasting’s Role in Election Campaigns,” in </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:9pt">McQuail</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:9pt">, D.
