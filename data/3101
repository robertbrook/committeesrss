I would like to make clear however that a distinction must be made between family farms, small farms, crofts and the huge estates. We benefit greatly as a society from farmers culture of hard work and long hours on which much of their success and our supply of food depends. How little things have changed over time with regard to the big estates can be deduced from the study of the great Tom Johnston’s 1909 book “Our Scots Noble Families” and the later works of John McEwen (1977) “Who Owns Scotland?” and Andy Wightman (1996 et seq.) “Who Owns Scotland).</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Disadvantages of the present system are myriad with huge subsidies going to the landward equivalent of the “slipper skippers” so derided by fishing communities. The “brown brogue bandits” appear to have been able to persuade the courts that their human rights would be compromised by the public finding out how much they received from us in grants. If you take the grant, we have a right to know how much you get. In recent years there has been a switch away from production subsidies in the direction of energy production. What should have happened was that communities owned or shared the ownership of windfarms. That isn’t what has happened. Huge subsidies are being paid by the public through their energy bills to major estate owners with minimal benefits accruing to rural communities. The 5% contribution of windfarm income which communities can share in some parts of the Highlands is voluntary on the part of developers and is not replicated everywhere. It should be. The Scottish Government in developing windfarm projects on the Forestry Commission Estate north of the border has insisted on a community right to partner the developer. This should ensure that ten times as much income accrues to the communities which </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">become involved.

Timber planting does the same job as improving the fuel efficiency of vehicles in reducing carbon emissions. Our effort tends to focus on the sources of pollution with little being done to enhance carbon sinks through re-forestation. Part of this effort should include Short Rotation Coppice which community land could provide with local supply chains giving permanent jobs. Youth unemployment might also be greatly reduced during the establishment phase when trees are planted. An increased emphasis on tackling climate change in this way would have huge benefits to society. A look at Hill Holt Wood in Lincolnshire would show that positive externalities abound with such schemes.</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:10pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 27.6pt; padding-left:8.4pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Is the current system of land tenure in Scotland the most efficient model for food security?</span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">In this area I defer to Robin Callander who’s 1998 tome “How Scotland is Owned” is a better source of information than anything I could contribute. Where I might comment is on the general position of small farms. Dairy farmers have been driven out of business in a relentless race to the bottom by supermarkets. I’d like my milk to be fresh and local. Increasingly it isn’t as small producers are squeezed out. Just as with banking, de-regulation has a down side. Milk is the worst of the markets where abolition of the state-run marketing board led to a rapidly increased concentration ratio at the wholesale and retail levels and to the rapid collapse of the number of farmers in the industry. This is most efficient for production in the short-run but bad for food security in the long-run as farms exit the industry. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:10pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 27.6pt; padding-left:8.4pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">In particular, is the current land ownership pattern contributing to, or inhibiting, economic and community development?

The right to receive subsidies for crop production and animal husbandry or for investment in productive machinery (with associated Capital Allowances) are clearly now assets of the farm. In a similar way the right to fish is determined by a permit granted by the state to (originally) the skipper of a vessel. The market system has allowed brown brogue bandits and slipper skippers to detach these assets from their original purpose and exploit them not as farm or fishing vessel assets but as personal pensions. I wanted the fishing permits tied to communities so they could not land other than in the local harbour. Neither the Royal Society of Edinburgh nor the Prime Minister’s Strategy Unit would go that far. Rights to collect subsidies when you’ve long since sold the farm are clearly wrong.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:10pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 27.6pt; padding-left:8.4pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">How does the tax regime affect the way in which land is owned in Scotland?
