Charging for publicly owned datasets, particularly when the data holder has a monopoly, tends to skew the markets that rely on that data in favour of larger participants that can most easily absorb licensing fees. Data charges are an input cost and create barriers to entry for SMEs. Open data licences remove those barriers, as well as opening up additional modes of re-use (on the web especially) that cannot be accommodated by fee-based licensing arrangements. Even within large companies, use of open data promotes more efficient working practices because the data can be shared in a "frictionless" manner with suppliers and clients.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="4" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14pt; padding-left:3.85pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">I am less convinced by arguments for open data as a driver for better government, or by the notion that "armchair auditors" can replace expert oversight of public finances. The increased availability of spending and performance data in a re-usable format is welcome, but no substitute for meaningful public consultation and open decision-making. My main criticism of the current Government's open data policy is that it has been subsumed into a rather amorphous "transparency" agenda. Government should do more to discourage commercial licensing of public sector datasets, and concentrate on releasing economically useful "core reference data" for open re-use.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q2.

Over the past few years we have had ministerial letters, a white paper, a review, consultations, at least two statements of principle, a dozen sector boards have been set up -- yet when it comes to release of the most valuable public data assets the Government seems afraid to commit. My impression is that within the rank and file of public services there is no particular resistance to open release of data; the problem is a lack of any clear go-ahead from ministers and senior civil servants.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q3.

The key prerequisite activity is to identify all of the datasets held by government, prioritise them based on their potential for beneficial re-use, and overcome practical barriers to their release (where release is economically feasible and consistent with other imperatives such as data protection and security).</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="7" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14pt; padding-left:3.85pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Unfortunately the indiscriminate dumping of small, low-value datasets on Data.gov.uk has created the illusion of progress -- 9,000 datasets sounds like a lot, but what proportion is that of what total? The Cabinet Office's very recent attempt to produce an inventory of "National Information Infrastructure" is on the right track, but it is too early to tell whether that initiative will generate any wholesale release of open data. (I am mindful that the previous Government made a similar attempt with its Information Asset Registers.)</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="8" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14pt; padding-left:3.85pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">I am unsure what the Committee means by "the Government's stated key outcomes in its Open Data Strategy". There are departmental Open Data Strategies but I not aware of a cross-government version other than the Open Data White Paper, which does not seem to list key outcomes. If this is a reference to the eleven "Corporate Commitments" as tabled in the most recent Written Ministerial Statement, I would say that those are of limited relevance to the performance of the Government's open data strategy as a whole. Public data with potential for re-use is not evenly distributed across Government, so metrics that compare one department to another are not very meaningful. In my view however the public </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">bodies making the greatest contribution to open data in the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> are ONS (as an inherent part of its role) and the Department for Transport (because it has simply decided to get the job done).</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q4.

Open data is typically about unlocking public datasets that already exist so that they can be re-used for secondary purposes. The rationale is that these datasets should be open because they have already been funded to deliver a public task, so arguing for production of new data doesn't really sit within the open data agenda itself. In practice of course there are many people with an interest both in the production of data to deliver a public task and re-use of that data for secondary purposes, since those two categories of use are often complementary.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="10" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 17.85pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">However, on this theme generally, it would be very desirable to have more involvement from government statisticians in the identification and prioritisation of public data for open release. Some supporters of open data tend to treat statistics as if they are not "real" datasets, but that is not my view. (On the contrary I regard small area Census outputs as the nation's single most valuable open data asset.) The Government has engaged extensively with IT developers and with entrepreneurs in the "app economy", but has somewhat neglected the potential for modelling and derivation of analytic insights from open data; this is an area where input from ONS staff would be useful.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q5.

From a re-use perspective the main difficulty with statistics is the frequency with which series are cancelled or redesigned to meet new government priorities or reporting requirements. This is a particular issue under the current Government; some quite significant statistical datasets have fallen to the axes of austerity, "red tape" or ministerial ill favour.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="12" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 17.85pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">With respect to administrative data it is difficult to generalise, but Government could do more to highlight the data sources maintained by departments; many remain quite obscure, though every government department does make an official statement of administrative sources to the UK Statistics Authority. Some administrative datasets contain personal data, and I know some open data advocates would like to redraw the lines of data protection to make more of that data available for re-use in an "</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">anonymised</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">" form.

That depends on the specifics of individual datasets. There is considerable scope for variation, just as there is with closed data. My priority is release of the data under an open licence. Basic accessibility is a necessity, but beyond that I would rather public authorities released their bulk data quickly than worry too much about formats, cleansing, how many stars the data has, etc.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="14" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 17.85pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">There is a tendency among some users to complain if an open dataset has not been "cut" to their idea of an ideal specification, but those complaints are often unreasonable. Public authorities cannot anticipate all the potential ways in which their data might be re-used, and should not be expected to try. Users should expect to carry out their own manipulation of the data in order to make it suitable for their purposes. (I am referring here to secondary use of the data, i.e. re-use, not to a public authority's presentation of their own data to their own end users.)</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="15" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 17.85pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Metadata standards are well understood (the Data.gov.uk pro forma is a reasonable example); the real question is how much documentation a public authority should provide with an open data release. It is difficult to argue that data should be released without at least adequate contextual information, and that may involve writing new material. Even if there is internal documentation already available, it may assume some level of institutional knowledge not available to external users.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="16" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 17.85pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The Committee's question as to who will use the data released is difficult to parse. There is no general answer; the potential for re-use of an open dataset depends on the characteristics of the individual dataset. Given that open data licensing makes it much easier to use data on the web and in mobile applications I suppose we can say that, all else being equal, an open dataset is more likely to reach a wider range of users than would a closed dataset with otherwise similar characteristics.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q7.

To the extent that there has been any cultural change or improvement in understanding, it is difficult to disaggregate the effects of the Government's open data policies from the broader influence of the open data movement in civil society. My main observation is that there is a disconnect between the Cabinet Office's rhetoric on open data and practical implementation by key delivery departments.

I have included four examples from the current period of Government, but it is difficult to see the influence of the Cabinet Office in any of them. A few smaller open data releases did emerge eventually from the measures announced in the 2011 Autumn Statement (Land Registry's Price Paid Data, basic company data from Companies House, etc.). However the Cabinet Office's formal demand-led pipeline for unlocking datasets, based on a budget given to the Data Strategy Board to "buy back" public data, has apparently not produced any outputs in its first year of operation.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q9.

However rather than take that as the logical baseline to monitor progress, the Cabinet Office seems to have decided to try a smorgasbord of approaches. In the first WMS report we had "openness scoring", apparently driven mainly by the format of each department's dataset records on Data.gov.uk. In the next two WMS reports we had the table of "corporate commitments" apparently selected only because they were common across departments. More recently the Cabinet Office has told us that Data.gov.uk is developing new tools to measure and compare department's adherence to commitments, and that once that functionality is bedded in the WMS returns will be stopped. None of this seems to have very much to do with measuring the extent to which departments are contributing to the open data agenda in real-world terms.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Additional Comments</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="24" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 17.85pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">These are several further points that the Committee may wish to consider as recommendations, as I think they would help to improve the Government's approach to open data or at least reduce some weaknesses in that approach.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="25" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 17.85pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The terms of reference given to the Data Strategy Board, and by extension to the Open Data User Group, require potential users to make a business case for open release of public data. This is contrary to the principle of "Open Data by Default", endorsed by the Government in the Public Data Principles and in the G8 Charter. If a dataset is closed, the onus in the first instance should be on the public authority to make a business case for it to remain closed; to demonstrate either that there is some insurmountable barrier to release (such as data protection or national security) or that the dataset is already available on commercial terms that do not discourage re-use. As a corollary to that approach, public authorities should be required to disclose any income they currently receive from licensing of data so that we can judge whether an open data approach would be more or less beneficial.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="26" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 17.85pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The Cabinet Office should collate and publish a list of all the departmental transparency “sector boards” now in operation, with the members of each, and require them to publish minutes of their meetings within a reasonable timeframe.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="27" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 17.85pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The Office of Public Sector Information has no </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">discernable</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> presence on the web.
