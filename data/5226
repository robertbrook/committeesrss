whilst parties that oppose the ban would benefit the greatest from its reversal.   The fact that the debate has taken on a partisan hue is therefore, inevitable.  The Electoral Commission warned that:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:11pt">ERS Cymru views the Wales Office’s proposal within the Draft Bill as a return to the status quo, and would hope that regardless of whether or not the ban is overturned in this Bill, this Parliament provides a sustainable resolution to this question, and that the issue is not constantly revisited by subsequent Parliaments.  This is, in our view, particularly important given the wider questions emerging regarding the size and capacity of the National Assembly and whether or not the numbers of Assembly Members should be increased.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

opening up a regional office in the constituency, and presenting themselves as the ‘local’ AM.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

Even with the ban in place since 2007, the practice of Regional AMs targeting FPTP constituencies has not altered.  Whilst the National Assembly has tightened the rules on how Regional AMs can ‘present’ themselves to the electorate, Regional AMs even under the ban on dual candidacy can target an individual FPTP constituency for electoral reasons. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Competition between representatives can make for better engagement with voters, giving a greater incentive for all parties to work hard for voters.

font-size:11pt"> that electing AMs via two different methods presents problems.  There is a sense of competition between constituency AMs and regional list AMs.  These tensions are exacerbated by the fact that the Labour Party has many more constituency AMs than the other parties, and the other parties have considerably more regional AMs than Labour.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;
