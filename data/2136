NGA has several categories of membership comprising school governing bodies, individual governor and independent local associations of school governing bodies. NGA seeks to represent the interests of governing bodies in all state funded schools (local authority maintained and academies). Our organisation’s aim is to improve the well-being of children and young people by promoting high standards in all our schools, and improving the effectiveness of their governing bodies.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Questions </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">General </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q1:  The draft Bill covers a broad range of specific activities and a large amount of legislative provision is amended by it.

We strongly believe that this responsibility should continue to sit with governing bodies.  The Procedure Regulations have just been updated and amended and specifically state that one of the core functions of the governing body is “ensuring that the vision, ethos and strategic direction of the school are clearly defined;” Expectations of student behaviour are clearly part of the ‘ethos’ of the school.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q3:  Does the draft Bill achieve its purpose of reducing the regulatory burden on business, organisations and individuals effectively and fairly?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">A:  A distinction needs to be drawn between removing a ‘regulatory’ requirement and reducing a burden.  For example, saying that schools do not have to follow guidance produced by the Secretary of State, but it does not reduce the requirement for schools to </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">act properly – it simply means that instead of being able to go straight to a known and accepted piece of guidance someone has to take additional time researching what it is appropriate – there is no reduction in burden.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">In the case of school terms the proposal extends new burdens to school governing bodies – in community and voluntary controlled schools responsibility for setting term dates is currently the local authority’s and this would move to individual governing bodies. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q4:  How does the provision in the draft Bill affect - the provision of education? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">A: </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Responsibility for discipline </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">As stated above a core function of governing bodies is to set the ethos of the school, expectations of pupils in relation to behaviour clearly form part of the ethos of the school.  Under current legislation, governing bodies are responsible for producing a set of behaviour principles which the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">headteacher</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> must take into account in drafting the behaviour policy, which must then be approved by the governing body. The effect of this legislation is not just to remove the requirement to develop a set of behaviour principles, but to abolish any formal statutory input for the governing body into the behaviour policy. This is not sensible on two counts: one the governing body’s responsibility for ethos and two the role governors play in reviewing exclusion decisions. If there is no shared development of the behaviour policy then the governing body may come to different conclusions about the implementation of the policy on review.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The NGA agrees that removing the current two tier approach is sensible – we are not convinced of the need for governing bodies to develop behaviour principles from which the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">headteacher</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> drafts a behaviour policy.  The NGA thinks it is vital that there remains a statutory role for governing bodies in the approval of any behaviour policy.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Home-school agreements </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Currently there are no sanctions/enforcement methods if a parent breaches or fails to sign the agreement.

Academies (including free schools), foundation and voluntary aided (VA) schools already have the power to determine term dates, yet very few have introduced longer terms and reduced school holidays.   On one hand, given that academies, foundation and VA schools already have this freedom, we do not see why this should not be extended to all schools.  It is schools that know their parents and pupils best, therefore they should be given the freedom to determine term dates, in the best interest of the pupils and their families.  However this does at the same time add another burden onto the school and needs to be acknowledged as such by all concerned.  Furthermore, if this </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">freedom is to be exercised well, it will take much co-ordination between local schools to ensure that problems are not created for parents with children at different schools.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">We do have serious concerns that giving this freedom to schools could cause difficulties for many parents if considerable effort is not put into setting dates. If all schools are going to be given the responsibility for setting term times, it is of vital importance that governing bodies ensure schools consult parents and communicate with their local authority/other schools in the local area to coordinate dates. This would need to be done in order to prevent problems for families in relation to organising childcare and holidays. Already parents with children in different schools across local authority boundaries grapple with different half-terms and Easter holidays, in particular. If all schools are given freedom to set their own terms this could become a bigger issue unless they communicate effectively during the decision-making process. Furthermore given that the regulations relating to authorised absence have also been tightened (the discretion to authorise up to ten days in a school year for a family holiday has been removed) this could become very difficult for some parents. Schools adopting different school terms might also impact on the cost and provision of school transport.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Although legislation has set out how many days a school must be open and  how many hours a teacher covered by the School Teachers’ Pay and Conditions Document (STPCD) can be required to teach, there has never been standard school year. Various attemp</span><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">ts have been made to bring one into force but these were never successful.  The STPCD states teachers cannot be required to work more than 195 school days each year (to teach pupils and perform other duties). If schools wanted to extend terms there would probably be additional costs as they would need to employ more staff, but there will be no additional money available to accommodate such a change.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">If all schools are given the freedom to set term dates, guidance which includes reference to research evidence would be essential, both from this country and abroad (for example, some countries with the highest level of academic achievement in Europe such as Finland have longer summer holidays).   In particular the fact that disadvantaged children appear to fare worse as a result of the summer holidays is not necessarily an argument to change the school year for all children.  The needs of all children might be better addressed by ensuring activities are available to poorer children over the summer holiday to give them the opportunities that other children have with their own families.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Staffing Guidance</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Currently all local authority maintained schools must have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State, relating to the appointment, discipline, suspension and dismissal of school staff.
