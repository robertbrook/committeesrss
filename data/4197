The education plight of the school is relegated below the </span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">academisation</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt"> process.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">The party line that 'Academies are the best solution to turn around failing schools' is disingenuous at the very least, and necessarily fails at the very first hurdle when, as happens, Academies themselves fail. The 'solution' then offered, is again a system based approach - to replace the sponsors - rather than to investigate the nature of the failings. There is a fundamental lack of will to do the right thing educationally - to follow the path of improvement that each school in trouble needs - and instead a blind adoption of political ideology. For primary schools, there is simply insufficient data to determine if the systems change that </span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">academisation</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt"> brings is effective. Yet this lack of data is never a hurdle for the </span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">DfE</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt"> in its ideological pursuits. The game they play is with a child's education, conveniently forgetting that what works at secondary school age may not work at primary school age.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">This myopic nature of the </span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">DfE</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt"> is more clearly illustrated in the faux consultations with schools prior to conversion. In one school, 98% of respondents did not want the Harris Federation to be sponsors. Yet Harris won the contract. A chilling loss of democracy.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">The claim that Local Authority oversight was failing schools was always a dubious generalisation - as always, some were good and some poor. But they did provide locally based oversight - Academies operated by Academy chains can struggle to match the LA roles because they are remotely located. Additionally, the centralisation of control of Academies and Free Schools into the hands of the </span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">DfE</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt"> is a disaster waiting to happen. They have already tentatively admitted that there needs to be a middle tier of administration to stop the </span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">DfE</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt"> becoming a bottleneck.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">When operating optimally, schools act as a community hub, and work collaboratively with other schools. By segregating schools by sponsor creates the potential for a divisive rather than collaborative into-school relationship.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">Whilst not-for-profit (at present), school sponsors are often businesses, and frequently operate with a business mindset, paying executives 5 figure salaries whilst able to recruit unqualified teachers. They can focus on the survival of their business as a priority, which often means the elevation of exam results at all costs. Cheating has been unearthed in some schools. Discipline in others, with longer hours to try to squeeze results from pupils becoming more common. Hallmarks of education via factory methodologies. The manipulation of entrance criteria so as to reduce SEN pupil intake has also been reported - SEN pupils can be seen as a liability as they can drag down the school exam result percentages.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">When a school operates with a business mindset, education can soon become compromised.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">At the same time that schools are removed from LA oversight, their finances are becoming ever more opaque, especially in the case of academy chains. The attitude of the </span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">DfE</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt"> is one that falls down on protecting the affairs of the sponsors ahead of transparency. Another indicator that education is not their top priority.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">Michael Gove and the </span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">DfE</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt"> regularly quote statistics regarding the efficacy of Academies and Free schools that hide the real truth, cherry picking snapshots in order to paint an falsely rosy picture of their Academies and Free schools. Again, they are happy to obfuscate rather than see their programme tarnished in any way.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">Likewise with recent problems at Kings Science Academy, for example, where staff are now subject to a police investigation into alleged fraudulent activities. The attitude of the </span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">DfE</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt"> when these misdeeds were discovered was to correctly report to the police but to incorrectly fail to ensure that action was taken. They were suitably embarrassed on this very matter by a whistle-blower some 6 months after the matter was raised. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">The focus again is self-protection rather than on ensuring a safe, secure, effective education system is in place.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">December 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
