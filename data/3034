Firstly, given the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">scale</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> of youth unemployment across the EU (and worldwide), this is an EU issue, as well as a country-specific problem.  Secondly, in many member states, austerity measures have resulted in: cuts to programmes; withdrawal of funding to support initiatives targeted at reducing youth unemployment; and, crucially, the curtailment of policy development to tackle often growing levels of youth unemployment/disaffection in many Member States.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">EU action does appear to respect Member States’ powers in the area of social and employment affairs.

However, the EU could play another crucial role through appraising the policy development and interventions of individual states, in order to encourage much greater cross-fertilisation of policy and practice. The key questions here would be: what works best, for </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">who</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">, and why? There are numerous examples of Member States ‘reinventing the wheel’, rather than drawing on the experiences and results of interventions/pilot policies which have already been developed, and either implemented or rejected by other countries.

The term ‘NEET’ was coined in the UK in the late 1990s as an identifier of a group which had originally emerged as a result of changes to unemployment benefit entitlement regulations that had been implemented in 1988. Essentially, these changes had removed young people under the age of 18 years from the unemployment statistics. ‘NEET’ is now widely applied across EU states and OECD countries and covers a broader age spectrum, typically 15 – 24-year olds. In contrast, the youth unemployment rate is a narrower definition, being a percentage of all young people (those aged 15 to 24) who are unemployed compared to the total labour force in that age group</span><a name="_ftnref1"></a><a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">.

Otherwise, the policy intervention and its recipients, i.e. young people, are too quickly labelled as failures. Also, the criteria for payments to training providers, such as payment-by-results delivery models, can create perverse incentives and encourage them to recruit young people who are easy to reach/easy to help, rather than identifying and supporting the hardest to help/hardest to reach to achieve success outcomes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">A ‘one-size fits all’ approach to policy intervention to tackle the NEET ‘problem’ is inappropriate, and doomed to failure due to the lack of homogeneity in the NEET population.  Rather, there needs to be a greater depth of understanding of its segmented nature, particularly among the over 18 group, and a tailored suite of policy intervention.
