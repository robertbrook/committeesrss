There are too many instances where the authority is over specifying products and services. They think they need something far superior from what they actually do. Take wheeled bins for example, too many authorities want coloured bins made from virgin material with solid axles. If central government were to say to authorities you MUST purchase products made from recycled material, with hollow axles, in black with different coloured lids the savings would be tremendous. However in many cases procurers are influenced by some suppliers in the market and procure a product in excess of what is required costing £’s more. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">In terms of procurements being transparent I think if authorities adopt the approach we take then they would be fully accountable.
