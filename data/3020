This letter is written in a personal capacity, although it draws upon reports of the Constitution Committee. I will focus my remarks on clauses 51 to 57 of the draft bill (on the power to disapply legislation no longer of practical use).</span></p><p style="margin:12pt 0pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12.5pt">The Constitution Committee has on a number of occasions expressed its view that effective parliamentary scrutiny is an important constitutional principle, and inappropriate delegations of power are a matter of constitutional concern. This is especially the case with Henry VIII powers. Clause 51 creates a significant Henry VIII power: the power for a minister to repeal any legislation that the minister considers is no longer of practical use. As the Constitution Committee said in its report on the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill (11th report, 2005–06, HL Paper 194), “The difficulties of lack of parliamentary time for legislative proposals are systemic. Delegation of powers to ministers to change the statute book is certainly not the only or necessarily a desirable solution to the problem.” (Para 29.)</span></p><p style="margin:12pt 0pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12.5pt">The justification for the power in clause 51(1) is presumably that there is spent or unnecessary legislation on the statute book. Yet a well-established procedure already exists for repealing legislation that “is no longer of practical utility”: statute law repeals bills. Such bills are prepared by the Law Commissions and scrutinised by the Joint Committee on Consolidation etc. Bills. Their progress through Parliament is usually reasonably rapid, with little or no debate at most stages. Importantly, though, each House has the opportunity to amend statute law repeals bills should a proposed repeal be considered an error, and the joint committee can seek justification of any repeal through the evidence that it takes. Given that the test for an order under clause 51(1) is virtually the same as that for statute law repeals bills, and the smooth parliamentary passage of such bills (in normal circumstances), it is difficult to see what is gained by the scheme established by clauses 51 to 57. What may be lost, though, is the expertise of the Law Commissions (by reducing them to the role of consultees), the ability of Parliament to amend an order under clause 51 and the general principle that it is for Parliament (not ministers) to repeal Acts of Parliament.</span></p><p style="margin:12pt 0pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12.5pt">It is noteworthy that the draft bill does not contain any substantive limitations on the use of the power in clause 51. This contrasts with, for example, sections 3 to 11 of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006. Paragraph 212 of the explanatory notes to the draft bill sets out the likely main reasons for which an order under clause 51 may be used. They are that the legislation was passed for a limited purpose which has now been achieved; that it has been superseded by other legislation; or that it regulates an activity which, as a result of social or economic development, no longer takes place. These reasons are helpful, but statements in the explanatory notes are no substitute for conditions or limitations on the face of the bill.</span></p><p style="margin:12pt 0pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12.5pt">Whilst, as already stated, this letter is written in a personal capacity, if and when a deregulation bill is introduced it will be scrutinised by the Constitution Committee for its constitutional implications.</span></p><p style="margin:12pt 0pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12.5pt">I am grateful for you consulting me on the draft bill and wish you success in your deliberations.</span></p><p style="margin:12pt 0pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:right"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12.5pt">The Rt Hon. the Baroness Jay of Paddington</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12.5pt">Chairman, Constitution Committee</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12.5pt">16</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12.5pt"> October 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:center"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:center"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:center"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:center"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:center"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:center"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:center"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:center"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:center"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
