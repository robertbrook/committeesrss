If an individual feels capable of carrying out electrical installation work there is nothing preventing that ind</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">ividual from doing so. Reporting the individual for breaking the Law, Part P, has no affect because the organisations responsible for enforcing Part P have no desire to prosecute. As far as I am aware there have been no cases since the onset of Part P in 2</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">005 of anyone being prosecuted under Part P legislation. </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">The message here is not that everything that is being installed is safe, on the contrary, the law as it stands is totally ineffective. </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">Historically the organisations who controlled electrical install</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">ation work were self-regulating and responsible to know one</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt"> other than their members</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">. The traditional route for learning the trade leading to practicing as an electrician is still extant, that is City &amp; Guilds courses and apprenticeships. Other than the in</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">-house collating of paperwork to satisfy entry requirements of applicants and the subsequent yearly membership fee to remain a member there is no active ongoing training to </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">improve individuals skills. The extent to which individuals are trained is left to </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">companies who employ apprentices and take them through pre-defined routes or individuals applying to and paying for their own training courses, some of which are too expensive to be pursued. Consequently, the NICEIC, NAPIT, ECA, Elecsa and the JIB all act </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">in their own interests.

This is not acceptable if competition is to be allowed in a true market place. It is unfair on NAPIT members who want to bid for contracts where NICEIC only members are specified. NAPIT have done well to make </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">some headway in to educating businesses who practice this restriction and have managed to reduce this practice. However it is still endemic amongst larger organisations, in particular the insurance sector.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="9" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 14.33pt; padding-left:3.67pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">It is my observation that the adequacy of supervi</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">sion by the DCLG </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">of actual practice within the electrical industry since the introduction of Part P has been </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">remiss</span><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">. Part P has been in force since 2005 and has been amended once. Many view the amendment as watering down the Law. Part P in itself is a good</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt"> Law because it galvanizes the need for skill, knowledge and ability to be installing electrical installations in homes. It has the potential to sort out malpractice and dangerous electrical installations but where it falls down is the lack of enforcement </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">and the irresponsibility of embracing the Law by those that are supposed to be administering it, that is, the local authority building control departments. There is totally inadequate support </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">for</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt"> the LABC to </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">be able to </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">ensure compliance</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt"> with electrical asp</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">ects of the building regulations. They only focus on the construction side of the building regulations and turn a blind eye to the electrical side</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">. </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">It is clearly under resourced. </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">Reporting mal practice to them is currently received with no commitment to ac</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">t. There is no active prosecution for non-compliance. </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">To-date I believe there has been no prosecutions under Part P. </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">Even the CPSs are loath to follow up complaints made to them about mal practice and non-conformance with part P. </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">They too appear to be conf</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">used about the fact that all electrical work is governed by P</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">a</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">rt P but some aspects are notif</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">iable. On the face of it t</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">he Law would appear to be unenforceable</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt"> and both the LABC and the CPSs have no commitment to enforce it, blaming each other for inadequac</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">ies in this regard</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">. The electrical industry is </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">fragmented rather than united.

The loser is the very people who the Law is trying to protect and that is </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">the end user who are the public.

I </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">would </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">urge the government to reduce</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt"> the stranglehold on the industry by the likes of the NICEIC</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">, who </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">currently drive a wedge through it, </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">believing that they should be th</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">e only ones to be recognised as being viable and who routinely compromise advancement of public awareness.
