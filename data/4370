Yet this programme is having a very limited impact on the availability of primary school places with few additional schools created this way.

It is, then, difficult to understand how this increasingly complex role – and one that is new to the DfE - can be accommodated within the DfE under the current proposals especially given the apparent failure of the market to ensure that academy numbers grow in the primary sector where they are most needed.

This is especially the case since the corollary of the policy to remove schools from LA control and ‘set them free’ is the assumption that academies will be largely self managing (or managed by their sponsor).  </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="17" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Even though (or perhaps because) academies often cite financial autonomy as a main reason for conversion the aspect of self management that is weakest is often finance.

Yet leaked documents suggest that Ministers have agreed to reduce the financial analysis of free school proposals and have considered scaling back on the quality assurance of financial budgeting despite civil servants (including PCS members) warning that this could lead to inaccurate funding allocations. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="19" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">PCS is also concerned that academies and free schools are not as accountable for the use of public money as local authority maintained schools.

A constant changing of heads and sponsors can add to risk especially when no local network of support exists. Conversion can hold back improvement in primaries by distracting heads and governors. This points to a need to re balance the support provided to academies by the DfE in order to ensure that the process of academisation does not undermine standards of education. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="22" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">PCS is concerned that instead of targeting resources at areas of high operational and financial risk the DfE is concentrating resources on marketing and on justifying policy in the face of public opposition. Recent leaked documents show that Ministers rejected a proposal to take risk and resources into account and to reduce forced academy conversion even when success in securing the conversion comes at a disproportionate cost and PCS members report that they have raised concerns with managers over proposals but that these concerns have been ignored. For example, one proposal for a free school was approved by the Minister despite significant concerns among all civil servants concerned over the capacity and competence of the head teacher proposed for the free school, the legal separation between the free school and its sponsor (so risking public funding for the free school being used in the interest of the sponsoring organisation rather than the school) and the cost of the capital development of the school compared to the likely educational benefits. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="23" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">In PCS’s opinion there needs to be a refocusing of resources on risk management and the building of capacity to monitor and intervene.

On the latter, there are worrying reports that some academy chains are not as responsive to children with SEN as the schools they replaced.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="29" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Data presented to Parliament and research suggest that academies are yet to have a positive impact on social inclusion, while independent r</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">esearch shows that free schools are failing to comply with statutory requirements on equality.

Yet a survey undertaken in October 2013 of the 78 free schools that opened in 2011 and 2012 found that only two are fully meeting the requirement to publish equality information and measurable equality objectives. Only six (7.7%) have published at least one equality objective - a lower level of compliance than other types of schools. Most free schools appear to be unaware of the Equality Act 2010 and the equality duty, with less than a quarter (23.1%) making reference to the Act in key policies and documents. Two-fifths of free schools (39.7%) are failing to identify prejudice-related bullying and/or derogatory language in their anti-bullying or behaviour policies. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="30" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 5pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">PCS, then, is puzzled why the DfE has decided to minimise its input to Equality Impact Assessments even though civil servants (including PCS members) have advised that this would lead to more criticism from the Regulatory Policy Committee and the Department’s risk rating increasing.

PCS concurs with reports questioning the value of some projects funded by the DfE’s capital fund. PCS members have reported projects where capital funding appears to be being used to encourage the development of schools for which there does not seem a need. In one case, the collapse of an academy proposal in an area already reasonably well provided for was replaced with a proposal for a free school in order to avoid the embarrassment of a failed academy proposal. PCS is not surprised, then, that the NAO has queried the DfE’s record on agreeing capital funding for projects without fully analysing risks and that questions have been asked of the DfE’s decision to commit funds to short term refurbishments or to write off the debts of private schools.</span><br /><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Civil servants are not negligent or unprofessional but staffing levels compared to workloads are such that the time to scrutinise and manage proposals is not available and a culture of threatened redundancies does not encourage civil servants to ask </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">difficult questions about propriety, probity or compliance, especially if these questions might delay a proposal driven by political will.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">STAFF CONFIDENCE </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="33" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">PCS would like the Committee to be aware of the results of </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">recent</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> DfE staff survey</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">s</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">.

Only 31% felt the DfE’s Board had a clear vision for the future – a fall of 12 points since the last survey and 20 points adrift from the civil service’s high performance score. Nor were staff confident the survey results would result in action: 70% of respondents did not think that effective action had been taken on the results of the last survey; a fall of 6 points since the last survey and 9 points adrift of the civil service high performance score. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="35" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">A comment in the survey’s Free Text box was not atypical: </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">The DfE has become a deeply ... politicised place to work.
