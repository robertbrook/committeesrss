I think that the context has to be seen in terms of &lt;2007-08. Here was an organisation that collapsed and has been through extraordinary turmoil in going through the process of survival and rebuilding itself. It is fair to say that that process of survival and all that goes with it—and there has been a lot, whether it is in terms of assets, building the balance sheet and so on—has caused the forward-looking businesses and the SME business perhaps, which is the one I was asked to focus on, to suffer somewhat. I think that is the underlying reason that today we find this situation.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q2 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Is this because, understandably, Stephen Hester and the most senior management team were focused on what could be described loosely as investment banking objectives, on restructuring the balance sheet and reducing the size of the balance sheet?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Andrew Large</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: I think it was to do with reducing the size of the balance sheet. I do not see that as being related particularly to the investment banking aspect, because the—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> I am describing that as an investment banking-type activity, getting the bank—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Andrew Large</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: Clearly. On the other hand, the reduction of the assets has had to involve a significant reduction of lending assets in the SME area itself. As you are all aware, the build-up of lending in the SME area was very, very significantly focused on commercial real estate and it was quite clear that the percentage of commercial real estate in the balance sheet had to be reduced. That required the actual asset base to be reduced, and you can see this puts an immediate tension on to the totality of the SME business, but I think that is quite different from any aspects of this relating to investment banking.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q3 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrea Leadsom:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Sir Andrew, to what extent were SME lending problems at RBS caused by a failure of senior management?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Andrew Large</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: I think it is part of what I have just been saying. Whether you call it failure or whether you say that they were so preoccupied with the whole question of, “How do we survive?” but I think it is fair to say that the overall SME business did suffer. It just was not all brought together and the moving parts were not joined up as effectively as they could have been.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q4 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrea Leadsom:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> You say in your report that you interviewed a selection of managers at RBS. What was the range of feedback that you had from them about what sparked the SME lending problems?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Andrew Large</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: I think that they could all see that the SME lending problem started with the very considerable over-emphasis on real estate up to 2008 and everything since then has had to be unwound. I give you a case in point: one of the issues—and there were many that came out in this report, and you will have maybe read this—is the whole question of the skills of the relationship managers. In the period up to 2008, the cry was, “We want more assets. We want real estate assets” and the skills needed to acquire real estate assets are rather different from the skills needed to lend to SMEs, where you have to understand their business, understand the cash flows and so on and so forth. That is just one example of where the knock-on effect of what happened back then is still being felt now. The question is, why was it not acted on earlier?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q5 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrea Leadsom:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Yes. Just before you answer that, because that was going to be my next question, why didn’t they do anything about it&lt;? You have said that the skills needed to assess assets as opposed to cash flows were rather different. Was there also a skew in their credit-scoring systems? Was there any sort of systemic issue or process issue like that that favoured the build-up of the physical asset, as opposed to cash flow type of assets on the balance sheet?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Andrew Large</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: I am not sure I can answer that wholly. My impression is that the build-up of real estate assets was just a straightforward statement of intent, that that is what they wanted. They wanted assets that were related to real estate, and the collateral being available. You do not have to do the same analysis as you do for the actual trading operations.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q6 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrea Leadsom:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Yes, but over the last 15 to 20 years, banks have started to rely more and more heavily on the credit scoring, haven’t they?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Andrew Large</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: Indeed.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q7 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrea Leadsom:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Certainly from talking to my own businesses in my constituency, there is a real sense that they look at a list of ticks and if you do not meet those ticks, then forget it.

What we did find evidence of was that the skills of some of the relationship managers, although significant attempts are being made to rectify this, are not as high as they might have been in that field. One of the reasons for that is that many relationship managers who were particularly skilled were moved from those roles into looking after customers who were entering distress of some sort. If you like, there was a deficit of capability in that field, which of course the bank is doing what it can to rectify.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q14 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrea Leadsom:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Going back to the organisation then, I think you were starting to say some time ago what the sense of those you interviewed was about how it was allowed to happen and could they have done anything to rectify it and when.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Andrew Large</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: I referred earlier to the need to rectify the balance sheet. There was something else that went on as well, which was that there was an emphasis on collecting deposits rather than lending. As you can imagine, that was pretty successfully carried out, but it was to the detriment of the lending, which is what the terms of reference of my study were all about. That is just another example, and then the skillsets I have already referred to.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Other things that intervened were that there was a definite emphasis on relationship managers not to put up credits for proposals unless they were clear that these had a reasonable chance of success. Equally, there was an emphasis on if you did put up credits that were not successful, maybe that was not going to be very good for your career. You can imagine that made the relationship managers somewhat risk averse.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">The other side of that coin was the people involved in credit analysis likewise basically were encouraged to be very careful and very strict and not let anything through that might be a problem, so they became risk averse.

When it became clear that the deposit aspect had been solved and that the lending numbers were not looking good, the bank did alter its emphasis in favour of lending. Since that time I think it is fair to say that there have been efforts from all the various parties to live up to that, but the headwinds that we have just referred to earlier meant that the aspirations they then had just could not be met, and so one has this sense of deep frustration, which I have to say I think is felt deeply within the organisation. The organisation itself feels very frustrated—they feel frustrated that, “Look, we want to succeed, we want to lend, but somehow it has not all come together”.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q17 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrea Leadsom:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> To what extent is organisational fragmentation to blame for that?

It is quite important, I think. It is fair to say that in the lead-up to the crisis, there was relatively little fragmentation in the SME lending area. It was very focused, but it was very focused on one thing, which was building up real estate assets. Not exclusively, of course. I should not exaggerate and I do not wish to. The fragmentation, which has taken on several different dimensions, has occurred since then and there are several aspects of that fragmentation. One is that there was a distinction made between the so-called core assets that they wanted to keep and the non-core that they did not wish to keep. Some of those non-core were in the SME area. Secondly, there was the enforced divestment of the so-called Rainbow business, which as you know is to </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">be sold. Again, that had to be carved away from the SME area, but it still has SME activity within it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">There is then this question of customers in distress, and you may wish to discuss this at greater length later, I do not know. The fact is that significant numbers of SMEs that were entering distress of some sort, but were capable of turnaround in most cases, were moved from the SME area into the Global Restructuring Group, which as you suggest reports to the Head of Risk rather than to the Commercial Banking Directorate.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> We are going to come on to that in more detail.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Andrew Large</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: I suspect you will, but there is one other aspect of fragmentation as well that is within that area and that is the so-called Business and Commercial Division, which is the main engine, and has alongside it, but does not report to, the more specialised areas of SME finance, invoice financing and so on, which they report at the top of the Commercial Banking Division, not at the Head of the SME.

It was the recreation and strength of its balance sheet. Of course the decisions that led to that happening were taken at the top of the bank and were implemented. This changed in 2011; it went on until 2011.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q21 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Stewart Hosie:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> But of course building the deposit book and the exercising of effective risk management, they were still key priorities in 2012.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Andrew Large</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: Yes, I have forgotten the precise date when the emphasis on lending was articulated much more clearly.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q22 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Stewart Hosie:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> I was going to ask that. Given that that was the figure in 2012, but that that changed, so building the deposit book as a key priority collapsed at 1% in 2013, how much of that was a symptom of senior management focus not being on lending and how much of it was the senior management focus simply on survival and packing the balance sheet?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Andrew Large</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: It is impossible to give you percentage numbers in either direction, but certainly the way I have reflected on it is that it was part of the continued concern for survival that had given rise to this and lending—just taking on the forward-looking activities, in a sense—took on a lower order of priority. The fact that it went on until so recently of course is one of the reasons that the bank is still struggling to get back to where it wants to be.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q23 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Stewart Hosie:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> I think we all understand the survival motive, self-evidently, but how much of those priorities—possibly skewed priorities—were reflected in staff remuneration? For example, did hitting deposit targets generate a bonus or a greater weight attached to that kind of activity in terms of remuneration? Was that incentivised in that way?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Andrew Large</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: There will have been an element of it. The whole incentive structure and the way that incentives are set in these areas has of course itself evolved over the last few years so that now any bonus that is given is on a fully discretionary basis, as opposed to there being some automaticity behind a series of numbers. But within that, of course there would have been elements—and I believe there were elements—of encouragement and incentivisation—therefore, “How successful were you in gathering deposits?” But that will not have been the entire basis on which any such bonus would have been considered. It would have been an element and of course the income from lending, as opposed to lending numbers, is also an element, but I think the </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">bank is very conscious that if you have an incentivisation to people that is, “Go out and lend” then that may not give you the results that you want in terms of the quality of the lending. One wants to have a very balanced approach and I think that the bank has tried to put that into effect.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q24 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Stewart Hosie:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> I appreciate that, and it is sensible, not simply to lend for the sake of getting lending numbers up, but to lend safely.

I think that the priorities were at that time more in favour of the gathering of deposits and the thought that somehow the bank was going to find itself in quite such a sense of criticism for not lending had perhaps not dawned on them in the way that today is all too apparent.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q26 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Stewart Hosie:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> I am quite surprised at what you have said there, and I have no reason to doubt that was perhaps the view of management within the bank, but the inability to lend, the failure to lend, the constant complaints to MPs from SMEs in particular, this is not an issue that has taken place over the last year or 18 months or two years. Over the last three or four years, we have all been knocking on the door of Treasury Ministers and banks saying, “Why are you not lending to this viable business?” I am quite surprised that the bank management were not hearing and feeling that as well.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Andrew Large</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: I think they were also very concerned about the prudential and risk aspects. Having had the trauma of the whole bank’s survival being called into question by virtue of bad lending that had happened up to the crisis, standards there were significantly raised, both as an internal matter and as a result of external pressure from the regulatory community. The priorities of management were focused, as we were discussing, on the deposits, they were focused on improving the prudence with which the lending took place. They were not focused to the same extent on, “We have to work to make sure that the lending numbers do go up”. Indeed, you can see that there is a tension here. It is not an easy one to answer.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q27 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Stewart Hosie:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> I am very sympathetic at a macro level to that argument, the banks must be safer, but what I am trying to get at here is an understanding that the bank’s core loan to deposit ratio had been achieved in 2011, so I am trying to understand what was it culturally within the bank that still led a small number of the people to believe that new lending was a low priority in 2012, but that taking deposits was a high priority when that ratio had already been met?

I think there was. I think that there was a disconnect between what the top management of the bank viewed as being the priorities and the actual actions in the field. Some of the areas here are quite interesting. If you take the &lt;exhortation to people to lend more prudently, the actual communication of what that meant is not straightforward and I am not sure that it was handled as well as it might have been, so that they understood what it was they were meant to be doing without becoming risk averse themselves.

Can I turn to the Tomlinson report, which I am sure you have had a chance to have a quick look at&lt;? I think it was sent to you about a month before your report was published.

I think it is quite an unusual report in that sense, and as you will have seen in my report, when I became aware of the allegations, it was quite clear to me that these had to be investigated. I do not know whether the allegations are true or not true, but they had to be investigated, and indeed that is what is happening. Section 166 from the Financial Conduct Authority has been launched, with a view to seeing whether those allegations are founded or not founded, and we shall no doubt hear the answer to that reasonably quickly, I hope.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q34 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mark Garnier:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> I hope so. Having the Treasury Select Committee or the Banking Commission then looking as a critique, if you like, of how reports are compiled, it does not necessarily look to be the most thorough of reports. There are certainly allegations. It was quite interesting, the first version included allegations against Lloyds and Barclays, I believe, but the version that was ultimately published only shows RBS. However, notwithstanding that, there are certain elements of it that do resonate, I think, with a lot of members of the public and certainly Members of Parliament about what is going on. I wanted to test your reaction to some of these ideas that are coming out of it, one of which is this almost engineering of businesses to go into greater stress, if you like, in order to create a default event.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">An anecdotal straw poll test of a constituency MP would suggest that broadly speaking there are three different types of SMEs that are out there. The first is the type of SME that has a very strong balance sheet and a very strong cash flow and is the type of business that is pre-selected for a £10 million overdraft, “Congratulations, you are the model customer for our bank. How can we help you more?” The second is the type of business that has a very, very badly-damaged balance sheet, but also very bad cash flow, and those businesses seem to be the ones that the banks are quite keen to offer extensive forbearance to on the basis that the cost of funding them is only 50 basis points a year, so it is quite easy to do.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">The third seems to be the type of business that falls within, broadly speaking, the Tomlinson type of idea, which is where you have a business that has a pretty strong balance sheet, but has cash flow problems. This is absolutely the area where banks, if they are seeking to shrink their balance sheet and shrink their exposure to SMEs, would find an opportunity to do it, because of course the business is possibly in a default event, it perhaps has not met interest payments, the cash flow issues have created a problem, but nonetheless the balance sheet suggests to the bank that there is a good opportunity for the bank to recover the principal of the loan. Those are the types of businesses that are falling within this, if you like, rather aggressive approach by the banks. Do you think that is a fair summary of what is going on?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Andrew Large</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: I do not know. That is what I hope we will get to the bottom of when the 166 investigation is underway, because within what you have said, there are obviously some very serious assertions. Perhaps I can just make some observations on why I think that there are elements of, if you like, plausibility in some of the assertions that are made, without having any idea as to whether those assertions are true or not. It comes to a significant extent to questions of organisation and governance. When a bank lends to an SME, the two parties have a common interest in the SME being successful in servicing the debt, paying it down and the relationship continuing. That situation is the </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">case right up to the point where the decision has been made that this organisation is irretrievable and therefore the interests have to diverge as between the bank and the customer in that resolution has to take place in the interests of the shareholder, recovering what can be recovered.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">The situation that I commented on in the review, which I gave a lot of thought to—and indeed, it was partly with some of the assertions that are in the Tomlinson report, but also ones that we had heard from elsewhere—is that the ultimate decision as to which SMEs will be handled by the Global Restructuring Group is made by the Global Restructuring Group. They have the say. Equally, the decision that might be made at a later stage that the organisation is beyond retrieval and has to be resolved is made within the Global Restructuring Group, which is an internal profit centre within the bank. Perceptionally, and I would also argue in other ways as well, I think that is flawed, because up to the time that the organisation is irretrievable, it seems to me that the interests in making sure that the mutual interests of the bank and the customer are held together should be owned by the SME unit itself.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">There is an argument that I understand, having been in the banking business myself at one time, that the party who has the relationship will be reluctant to admit failure of the party for whom he or she has a responsibility, and therefore there would be forbearance, which would mean that companies would collapse before they had been able to be helped to turn around and get themselves back into mainstream activity. That argument is used sometimes to say, “Then that ought to be done by a whole set of different people” and hence the argument that it should be done by a bunch of specialists, a group of specialists in GRG. All my experience tells me that the people within GRG are extremely experienced and very good at their job, but from the point of view of the SME it may not look that way. If you are an SME that maybe has some difficulties, as many companies have, but is clearly not in any sense close to having to be resolved and then you find yourself getting into GRG, you may say, “Oh, my goodness. What has happened? I seem to be now being treated in a completely different way” and the way in which that happened may or may not have been handled in a very sensitive way. At this stage, I think as a result of this mixture of perception and fact, there is a real problem that many SMEs will feel very uncomfortable and many of them will say so and you will get complaints of the sort that began to emerge.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">When you then move to the next step, which is that GRG has the responsibility also for making the decision as to when an organisation should be resolved, and when it is known that GRG itself is a profit centre, then you can see that perceptionally the sort of assertions that there are in Dr Tomlinson’s report, they sound plausible. Equally, those statements are so strong, and the behaviours that could &lt;lead to that happening would be so extreme that one wants to feel they cannot be true. That is </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">why I think this forensic work that is going to be done—and is being done now—is so important. I am sorry to answer you at such length, but I think it is obviously very important and I know an area of great public interest.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q35 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mark Garnier:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> That is an incredibly helpful answer, thank you for that. I was going to test you slightly on one thing, which is that what seems to happen is before you get to GRG, you go through an SME support type of—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Andrew Large</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: Sometimes, but again, this is not a very clear situation. Some SMEs do go into a support unit within the SME area, which is called Special Relationship Management. Some of them get their relationship manager moved from being their mainstream relationship manager to a special relationship manager and some of them have a second move to GRG later. They have then had several moves. For a small organisation that may or may not have problems of whatever depth, you can see this can be a pretty stressful state of affairs.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q36 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mark Garnier:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> It can be stressful for two reasons. The first is that a lot of SMEs that I have had experience with—not necessarily with RBS, but with a number of other banks—find that there is a continuity of service, where they have an individual who has an understanding of their business.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Andrew Large</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: That is right.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mark Garnier:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Of course they find themselves then moving to that support group. The experience I have had when I have challenged the banks on this is they say, “Yes, but you are looking at an SME that is moving from a relationship manager who has maybe 500 customers to a relationship manager who has just 25 customers, so thereby you are getting a multiple of times of the effort coming into it”.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Andrew Large</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: Sure.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mark Garnier:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> However, to receive that service, it is much more expensive, so while it is economically viable to have one relationship manager looking after 500 SMEs, it is not if you are not charging. That is why they have to charge these SMEs to have, if you like, a one in 25 relationship as opposed to one in 500, which of course sounds very logical until you are looking—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Andrew Large</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: Until you are the SME.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mark Garnier:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Until you are the SME, when you have to stretch—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Andrew Large</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: Yes, and then you find it exacerbates the problems you already have.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q37 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mark Garnier:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> It exacerbates the problem, absolutely right. I too have worked as a banker in the past, actually with you many years ago, and we will talk about it later, but I also worked as a business consultant and I was looking at a number of businesses &lt;that were suffering from exactly this problem. They were viable businesses, but for one very, very minor reason or another they were tripping across an event. For example, they had a loan to value ratio of 65% and it might have gone to 66% under a new sort of drive-by valuation or whatever, so that triggered some of these things, and suddenly what was a viable business was made unviable for what appeared to be artifically-created default events. This is what tips them over the edge into the problem. I think your point is very valid and very important about this forbearance, where you do have relationship managers who are very reluctant to bite the bullet on the relationship and say, “This has gone wrong”.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Again, I am having more of a conversation than a series of my questioning you and you giving answers, but do you feel that in general SMEs are being well-looked after, or do you think there are very, very legitimate complaints by SMEs about the way they are treated for there to be a serious problem out there?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Andrew Large</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: I think the very great majority of SMEs are comfortable with their relationship and are being well-looked after. Clearly there are a number where the types of problems we have just outlined occur and the situation that RBS has is one where I think this question of organisation and governance badly needs to be looked at and I believe they are looking at.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q38 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> You answered this question about GRG by saying, “There might be some of this or it could be perception”—I have concertinaed a huge answer— and you are saying you are glad it is being looked at, but you have had a good poke around already. What is your bet?

Take the business that is not quite in forbearance but is not doing very well—it is on the weaker side, to the extent that they get thrown by GRG into what amounts to a forced sale or some restructuring that breaks down the activity altogether. Since they are just short of the zombie status, to the extent that that is imposed on them, would that not mean that the effect of GRG’s activities will reduce the number of businesses that are close to or are in zombie status?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Andrew Large</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: Yes. I think the answer is it would, but if your concern—and I know this concern has been expressed—is that there are too many so-called zombie activities being kept alive, then the way in which GRG is being accused, or it is asserted it acts, would ensure that some of them would not be kept alive. But that of course does not answer the fact that you have some exceedingly unhappy people feeling that they have been extremely unfairly treated.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q41 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Absolutely.

Indeed, I was not set up to do so, because to find such evidence you have to set up a process, which now has been set up by the FCA under this section 166 process, because you have to have due process with people, the organisations, you have to be able to obtain data and so on, and that requires to be properly set up.

My understanding is that as entrepreneur in residence at the BIS, he will obviously have been in touch with and kept in contact with the Secretary of State, so the Secretary of State would have known he was writing the report. I think, as anybody would have done who had read those assertions and was being asked about them, one could only just say, “Look, those are shocking assertions”. If it had been me, I would have gone immediately to state that I wanted them to be looked into to find out whether they were true or not true.

I think he goes a lot beyond that, and if I recall correctly, he made some comment about splitting them into six units or some such. Look, to be honest with you, I think that is a very extreme suggestion. If you look at how difficult it has been for RBS to carve out the Rainbow business and the difficulties it has given rise to for RBS in so doing, because if you take the SME business, you have continuing activity on the ongoing business, you have the SME business within that which is being hived off. The thought that those two banks would somehow be split into six does strike me as being a very extreme suggestion.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jesse Norman:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Fanciful.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Andrew Large</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: I simply do not understand how it would happen or what it would be meant to achieve, to tell you the truth.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q61 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jesse Norman:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> But it does not sound like you demur from the idea that in part it was the size of RBS that caused its management to be distracted and unable to focus on these issues in the SME market.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Andrew Large</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: No, I am not sure that I think it is all about size. Going back, I think it is to do with the problems they had that they had to fix. I know that of course the bigger you are, the more complex the management processes can be and therefore the more important it is that you do not have a fragmented business, for example.

The question is whether the job they are asked to do is the right job, given the SME environment and the issues we just discussed. I have not looked at this in terms of there being wrongly-set incentives for GRG people, in the sense that the GRG people are doing what GRG is meant to do, which is to, on the one hand, try to turn businesses around and get them back into the mainstream, but on the other, where that cannot be achieved, to resolve them in a way that gives the maximum return to the shareholder, which at that stage becomes the leading point.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q63 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jesse Norman:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> But there are two problems, are there not? First, is the GRG structure setting the wrong incentives, and that would mean a change to the nature of GRG in the way it set itself up as judge and jury, as we discussed?

I think that the FPC was formed because there was no macro-prudential capability. In fact, when I was at the Bank of England, it was one of the things that I lamented did not exist, so I have thought about this quite deeply. On the other hand, forensic analysis and policy choice in the financial stability area is extremely difficult, not only that, but you have to do it the whole time, because it is no good just worrying about financial stability when there is a problem, you have to be worrying about it when there is not a problem. If you worry about it when there is not a problem and you start making policy choices that look to those who favour, for example, growth as though they are holding it back, then it </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">puts you in a very difficult position, because on the one hand, the policy choice you need for financial stability might be quite clear to you, but on the other, that is something that those who have the responsibility for the overall economic policy and growth will not feel very comfortable with.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q66 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jesse Norman:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> What would a classic example be that shows the tension between these two objectives, as you see it?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Andrew Large</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: I think that there would be a tension if it would ever be the case that the Financial Policy Committee would believe that a policy decision needed to be made that would, for example, reduce the level of indebtedness or perhaps have an implication for the value of property at a time when it was felt that, from the point of view of the overall economic objectives set by the Government, the growth of the property market was more important. That would be very difficult. This is the point I am trying to make in the letter, which is that the responsibility for growth and the economic objectives is a responsibility, it seems to me, that is vested in Government and in Parliament.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q67 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jesse Norman:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> But no Government is going to want to exercise what would inevitably be the nuclear option of overruling its own recently established, in this case, regulator.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Andrew Large</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: No, but the FPC itself, I am not suggesting the FPC would be blind to what its policy measures would entail, not at all, but there are different ways in which you can achieve them. I will give you an example, and I think it may be one that you have discussed here in another context. If, for example, you were looking at property, there are various ways you could act. One would be loan to value ratios; another might be loan to income ratios. Each of those policy choices would have different implications, for example, for home ownership. I am aware of the exchange of letters that you, Chairman, had with the Governor on that very subject, where the responsibility for home ownership clearly lies with Government, it does not lie with the FPC.

In the case of monetary policy, which has similar sets of wording, it works because the objective in monetary policy is observable, you know what price level you have and you can steer in order to seek to achieve it. In the case of financial stability, it is not observable until such time as you have failed. The question is how close to that point are you going to wish to be, and there is going to be continual argument about that. My suggestion is that is something that Government has to be prepared to say, that on the one hand, the Government has to be prepared to form a view on whether the stance that the FPC is taking is moving towards the economic graveyard—I think those were the words that the Chancellor may have used—or not.

I am summarising, I am drawing things together. You have said when it comes to the dysfunctionality of lending—and we are agreed that there has been dysfunctionality of lending and, probably still is, lending performance in RBS—capital is not the problem. The fact that they are trying to find ways of rebuilding their balance sheet in order to satisfy capital requirements is not the problem.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Andrew Large</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: That is correct.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q79 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Therefore, specifically, the Bank of England’s tightening and the PRA’s tightening of capital requirements, which they did in conjunction with the FPC—this is the 7% RWAs—as it has been alleged by the banks, from what you can tell by looking at RBS, should not have led to a reduction in lending?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Andrew Large</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: That point is a little bit more moot, because of course if you look at the affordability of debt from the point of view of the SMEs, and you think in terms of what cash flow they have and what is a prudent ratio, if you like, of the cost of debt to the cash flow they have, clearly to the extent that the banks are caused to try to recompense for the capital that they have to put behind that lending, it will affect the affordability from the point of view of the SMEs.

When it comes to the Tomlinson report, you are vigorously rejecting the idea that we should split the state-owned banks into six on the grounds that this is just not practical and would be a nightmare, and presumably it would throw these banks into a position where they would do even less lending for a good time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Andrew Large</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: Also, there are other things going on in the competition arena.

Do you think there is something in the argument that that could have addressed or could address some of the organisational problems to which you have alluded by providing more simplification, better lines of accountability and clarity about the structure, and that also at the same time, the creation of a good bank might bolster SME confidence in the good bank that they are now starting to do business with, clearly a bank dedicated to dealing with their concerns and that they might feel they could trust?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Andrew Large</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: Chairman, there are many aspects to that, and if I could just make several observations. The first is that I think that there is a case for feeling that if there had been a split, good bank-bad bank, back in 2008, it would have had an impact in terms of reducing the amount of capacity of management that had to be deployed on survival, because the good bank presumably would have been in a surviving state and therefore they would have &lt;been able immediately to go into a forward-looking mode. That is the first thing.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">The second thing is that I would hope that the decision having been made to go for an internal approach as opposed to a juridical one late last year, in the latter part of last year, that that would be given a chance for success, given that certainly all the people I met in RBS are determined to do what they can to try to make a success of it.

I was just saying that I think that if the management is successful in reviving the SME business in the way that they have said that they wish to do, and in following all the recommendations in the report, and no doubt many others, then that ought to be capable of creating a revival of trust.
