I have physical evidence of this in the form of fragments from a degradable plastic bag 8 years after production. I discussed this evidence with the Select Committee on Water Quality in Feb  2013. So there is evidence that current formulations for degradability can result in formation of numerous small non-degradable fragments or </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">microplastics</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">; the environmental impacts of which are still not clear. </span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 33.01pt; padding-left:2.99pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Even for materials that are described as ‘degradable’ there is limited evidence that they will degrade within an appropriate timeframe in the marine environment where the concerns about litter are greatest, but conditions are typically cold and dark.

For such materials to be considered as exempt they would need to be able to degrade rapidly and harmlessly in a wide range of natural habitats as well as in landfill, the end products being carbon dioxide and water. A suitable experiment to assess this would be use of </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">respirometry</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> to confirm the plastic is used as a substrate and consumed by micro-organisms – at present there is a lack of such evidence.</span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 33.01pt; padding-left:2.99pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Even if evidence of degradability were available it is questionable whether use of degradable material for production of plastic bags should be promoted by exemption from the levy.  An exemption would in effect give consumers a </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">message that it is acceptable to litter with these materials. A far better way to reduce litter and reduce reliance on the fossil carbon (oil /gas) used for production of plastics is to move toward reusable bags that can be recycled at the end of their life. Single use degradable plastics perpetuate the linear use of resources and compromise ability to recycle since they contaminate the recycling stre</span><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">am.</span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 33.01pt; padding-left:2.99pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">References: </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">O'Brine</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">, T. and R.C.
