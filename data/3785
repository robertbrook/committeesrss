Perhaps this is because other road users have become more experienced in dealing with cyclists and because more of the vehicle drivers also cycle</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> at times and have experienced poor driving – so they have changed their behaviour. </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Generally, the debate needs to change from cyclists v other road users, to good road users and poor road users. I believe that enforcement of poor road use (for all users)</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> should be more comprehensive – maybe short campaigns, where poor cyclists, poor drivers are penalised. I would also like to see more use of video training so that drivers experience what it is like on a bicycle (there are lots of youtube clips available w</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">hich are frankly terrifying) and cyclists can see the hazards they cause – perhaps this could be incorporated into penalties more than it currently is – go on the course and reduce your penalty.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">What central and local Government could do to improve cycling</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold"> safety.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Better standards for cycle lanes/paths</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> applied nationally</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> – there are some very good examples, but many are worse than useful. As an example, on Langworthy Road South, the cycle lane is a shared footpath, with a solid line. This is ignored by pede</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">strians and cyclists. Additionally, there are a number of side streets into industrial areas which have right of way over the cycle lane. As a cyclists I would have to dodge the pedestrians and keep stopping to check behind me for cars and vans turning ont</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">o the side street. I don’t do this as I am trying to get from a to b quickly. Consequently, I use the road, which annoys the drivers who can see a cycle lane, without understanding why a cyclist isn’t using it. </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Many </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">segregated cycle paths are not wide eno</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">ugh and are not cleaned frequently enough, so are covered in broken glass, wet leaves etc. making them hazardous.
