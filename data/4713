A mixed sixth form would bring the benefits of co-education once the foundations of learning had been laid. In addition, the existence of two high achieving girls’ only schools in Westminster </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">meant there was a gender imbalance in the City’s mixed schools, with boys outnumbering girls, causing some girls to behave reticently in the classroom among the more numerous boys -  a problem exacerbated by local cultural and religious factors.

The pan-London school place shortage is well-known. However, the fact that local authorities educate many children from other boroughs, as well as “exporting” their own, creates difficulties. Policymakers wi</span><span style="color:#222222; font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ll be well aware of these. However this is a particular challenge for free schools in supportive authorities. The local authority has a statutory duty to provide enough places for “its” children and no such duty to educate others. So, as the authority weig</span><span style="color:#222222; font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">hs up the demands upon its resources, even though it is supportive of the free school and will benefit from the places it provides, it may be inhibited in making a capital contribution that will in part benefit children from outside its boundaries. There i</span><span style="color:#222222; font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">s an expectations gap between, on the one hand, parents who believe that the authority is supporting free schools and that the priority is providing good school places, regardless of the vagaries of borough boundaries, and, on the other hand, the constrain</span><span style="color:#222222; font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ts on an authority imposed by a funding framework which apparently does not compensate it fully for educating children from outside its borders. </span></li><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:105%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">We had no difficulty with being directly accountable to the Department for Education.
