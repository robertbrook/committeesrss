Certainly the relationship-based approach that our respondents advocated needs to be resourced. But it is clear that this approach – where a minim</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">al number of adults make, and keep, a commitment of support over time to young people who do not find that commitment elsewhere, really makes a difference. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Light touch interventions might work for the majority of students who simply need to be kept on the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">right track</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">.
