My concern covers a number of areas:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">1: The first area of concern relates to the fact while that the Housing Standards Review consultation contains the statement from the government that it proposes to wind down the role of the Code for Sustainable Homes it does ask any questions within this consultation to gain views on whether respondents feel this is appropriate. The Code for Sustainable Homes has played a central role in the raising of standards &amp; the development of more sustainable housing over the last few years and the proposal to wind its role down within any form of consultation appears to be very arbitrary. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">2: The Nation Planning Policy Framework, launched by the current </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">government </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">supports</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">, the “</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic">presumption in favour of sustainable development</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">”.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt"> The problem with the National Planning Policy Framework is that it provides no guidance as to what is a </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic">sustainable development</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">In terms of housing development the use of the Code for Sustainable Homes provides a independent, third party assessment of a developments sustainable credentials. It is important to realise that the Code for Sustainable Homes covers more than just carbon reduction. It covers none categories covering environmental &amp; social aspects of sustainability. Within the currently Housing Standards Review there is no real proposal as to how a housing development’s sustainability should be assessed &amp; does not provide any benchmarks on measuring sustainability.    </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">3: The Housing Standards being proposed by the government deal with only 3 areas that are covered by the Code for Sustainable Homes. These are Accessibility, Water Efficiency &amp; Energy. It is proposed that certain areas such as Health &amp; Well Being, Waste &amp; Pollution issued should be covered by the planning process, but no standards or benchmarks are being proposed. In fact within the three areas being covered by the proposed Housing Standards, the extent of benchmarking is not as extensive or as high a quality as that currently contained within the Code for Sustainable Homes. The government appears to be proposing no standards or benchmarks for some very important areas of sustainability which are currently covered by the Code for Sustainable Homes – Materials, Management (of the construction process), Ecology. The current Housing Standards Review consultation is very deficient in allowing a proper discussion &amp; consultation on the marinating a serious &amp; rigorous benchmarking process for measuring future development’s sustainability as required under the National Planning Policy Framework.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">4: The government accepts within the Housing Standards Review that other voluntary standards have a role to play within the house building industry, while seeming determined to remove the Code for Sustainable Homes which could be a valuable voluntary standard that could be used by local planning authorities to set know required standards for future developments within their area. Already a large number of planning authorities use the Code for Sustainable Hones for this purpose. Surely this is the essence of localism, allowing local planning authorities to set standard that is deemed appropriate for their communities after going through the due process of public consultation.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">5: The government feels that incorporating certain minimum energy, water efficiency &amp; accessibility standards within the proposed Housing Standards, and eventually into the Building Regulations, covers’ their sustainability objectives. If this is the case then this should form part of a consultation </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">process as it is clearly a significant change of approach towards what sustainability is. This consultation would have to incorporate an understanding of the impact of the government’s definition of zero carbon homes, what is being proposed for Allowable Solutions so that a full understanding of what is being proposed is understood. At the moment it is fragmented and not joined up. For instance the government as stated that their zero carbon homes standard is a 100% reduction in the regulated energy levels achieved under the 2006 Building Regulation standards of which a significant proportion can be offset by the proposed Allowable Solutions. While this sets a minimum standard many within the industry feel this is insufficient to help the country to meet the commitments of the Climate Change Act &amp; the stated intension of reducing the UK’s greenhouse gas emission by 80% by 2050. This is in the context that buildings are responsible for around 44% of the UK’s emissions &amp; housing alone is responsible for around 25%. This is does not form part of the current consultation</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">6: Another issue that does not form part of the current consultation is the fact that the Code for Sustainable Homes is able of providing more than a minimum standard currently being proposed by the Housing Standards. The Code currently provide &amp; could provide in the future a pathway for increasing levels of sustainability above the minimum standards that would be covered by Building Regulations and a process for measuring this.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">7: Another issue that is not addressed within the current consultation on the Housing Standards is the existence of trained specialist profession that is able to provide independent expertise and assessment of housing schemes when their sustainability credential are measured. The potential cost of losing this expertise has not been addressed or how independent measurement of a housing developments sustainability credentials will be measured in the future. The government appears to have decided to remove one process (the Code for Sustainable Homes) without consulting on how this should be replaced.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">In conclusion I feel that the government’s decision to wind down the role of the Code for Sustainable Homes without proper consultation is seriously flawed which seriously comprises the acceptability of the proposed Housing Standards currently out for consultation.</span><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic">3 October 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
