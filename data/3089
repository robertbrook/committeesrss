Do you think that the EU should be providing funding to Member States to tackle youth unemployment? Does EU action respect Member States’ powers in the area of social and employment affairs?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Certainly, the European Commission has funds that may well be addressed to combat the high rates of youth unemployment and the precarious work for young people all over Europe.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">During much of its history, the European Union had been the guarantor of a model which fought for social justice and equality through the defence of a strong Welfare State in all its members States. Unfortunately, since 2010 the European Commission diverted from this policy to another which only aim is on fighting the deficit through public expenditure cuts and the reduction of social and labour rights. Many times, these decisions are taken in violation of national powers in these matters. These policies have resulted into nothing but increasing levels of poverty, precariousness and inequality both in the labour market and the society as a whole</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The only way to ensure respect to Member States' powers in the area of social and employment affairs while also guaranteeing a comprehensive social policy is through a sound dialogue between social partners and, where appropriate, with other organizations of civil society. This procedure should be followed both at the birth of these measures at European level as well as during the implementation and follow-up of these measures in the Member States.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">It is then clear that the ETUC is against the intervention of the Commission in decisions on the national budgets of Member States, especially when this is limited to the obligation of reducing public expenditure on education, health and social services, as well as to deregulate labour relations. This behaviour deserves an even greater opposition when the intervention comes from organizations which are not subject to democratic control (like the IMF). Yet, the situation that we are living in the last time is unprecedented: while this interference occurs (and in a way particularly disproportionate in those countries intervened by the Troika), at the same time it has been beginning to put into question the legitimacy of the European social partners to sign joint agreements which could be later converted into Legislative Directives to be transposed to the 28 countries of the EU. It is important to state that this enters in direct contradiction with the Europe 2020 strategy.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Hence, it is crucial to make a sound statement that European social partners are legitimized by the Maastricht Treaty to make binding decisions on the issues of their responsibility. To block this process, because it comes from the Member States or the Commission itself, is an attack to the rights of European workers and a charge against the democratic bases underpinning the European Union.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">2. How do you think that the EU can best ‘add value’ to Member States’ efforts to tackle unemployment?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Here it is important to mention the recently finalized process of European Social Dialogue which ended up with the signing of a </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Framework of Action on Youth Employment</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">. This document contains proposals to combat youth unemployment through four main lines of action: training, transition between the educational system and the labour market, employment policies and self-employment. The document highlights the need of ensuring quality transitions and decent work for young people through a variety of actions to be undertaken by the Member States.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The added value of the EU to this Framework of Action is obvious, since it is a political document which parts from the dialogue and is constituted from the exchange of best practices in youth employment throughout the 28 countries of the Union. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The joint document recognizes that structural labour market reforms alone will not solve the problem of the youth unemployment and that other macroeconomic policies are needed.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Another element which could still further enhance its “added value” would be to make the transposition to the Member States more binding, since the Frameworks of Actions are not that obliged but they are a set of recommendations. The transposition of European legislative initiatives in the field of employment and social policies must be always conducted through a process of dialogue between the social partners and the national Governments, this is certainly another "added value" of the EU which has been deteriorating over time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">3. Is there sufficient disaggregation in EU measures to tackle youth unemployment between, for example, support for young people classified as being not in education, employment or training (‘NEETs’), support for newly qualified graduates looking for work, and general career guidance?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">It must be admitted that, at least on the paper, the different measures included in the Youth Employment Initiative (Youth Guarantees, apprenticeships and internships schemes, among others) seem to be tailored to the wide range of social and economic realities of unemployed young people in Europe. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">However, a study in greater depth should be carried out on what measures may be most appropriate for each young person according to his level of education and his social background. For example, second-chance schemes for young people who have left their studies in order to retake the education system can be an effective method to help them in their professional career; while the promotion of entrepreneurship – another measure fostered by the EU – may only be useful to a very specific sector of the population (those who have attained a high level of education or are specialized in a very concrete and practical field; but not for any case).</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">4. Are the EU’s accounting, monitoring and evaluation procedures sufficient to be able to determine whether EU funded projects to tackle youth unemployment have been successful or not? Are there ways in which they could be improved?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The European Union carries out a conscientious follow up of the programs it funds. Either way, greater involvement in the processes of accounting, monitoring and evaluation of the social partners at all levels (European, national, regional and local) – as well as other involved stakeholders – would undoubtedly improve the effectiveness of any European measure.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">5.
