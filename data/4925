In addition, there remains a significant amount of illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing activity still taking place in the UK’s waters. Focussing attention on the regulation of these activities will result in the greatest gains for marine biodiversity.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The regulation of MCZs must take account of the current economic conditions and the need for economic growth. It is vitally important that the small businesses that depend on recreational activities like shooting, fishing and water sports are not compromised by regulations that prevent these activities taking place. Government should ensure that the regulation of activities in MCZs reflects the requirements of the </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Red Tape Challenge</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> and the Regulators’ Code.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">BASC recommends that features needing protection above the mean low water mark be designated as SSSIs, as these will still be included in the MPA network. This is an area that is usually protected by SSSI legislation. The intertidal area really contains terrestrial features where the policy for identifying, designating and managing terrestrial features through the SSSI system is well understood by Natural England and the stakeholders it works with. By designating terrestrial habitats as MCZs there is a real risk of causing confusion amongst stakeholders about which competent authority they should work with when discussing </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">operations likely to damage the site</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">BASC members currently shoot wildfowl over many existing marine protected areas (SSSI, SPA and SAC).

Rather, the explicit purpose of the Act is to designate MCZs to conserve marine flora and fauna, marine habitats and features of geological or </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">geomorphological</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> interest. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">It is BASC’s understanding that there is no basis in the legislation for the establishment of Reference Areas.  Indeed, we consider that the development of Reference Areas should be considered ‘Regulatory Creep’ as it does not accord with the Principles of Good Regulation.  BASC therefore believes that as there is clearly no legal requirement for Reference Areas they should be given no further consideration.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">However, should that not be the case then BASC would urge Defra to refer the process under which Reference Areas are being developed, specifically back to the Regulatory Policy Committee. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">With regard to the management of the 27 MCZs that have been designated so far and those that will be designated in the future, BASC would like to make the following recommendations:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Site designation is designed to protect certain features; these must be the focus of protection with a clear list of what activities are likely to cause significant damage to those features. Only activities that are likely to cause significant damage should be considered for regulation. Every attempt should be made to find ways of allowing activities to continue through agreed management plans that address how the activity is compatible with the conservation of the designated feature. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">It is critical that when designating new sites there is good evidence that shows what the interest feature is and why it is in need of conservation management. There are many English coastal businesses that depend on continued unregulated access to the sea for their success. These include inshore fishing and businesses that support recreational activities. Coastal areas also support many longstanding cultural activities like wildfowling, shore angling and </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">samphire</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> collection.
