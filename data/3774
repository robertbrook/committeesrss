Only when they are clearly slowing down or have made any other sign that they have definitely seen you, can you proceed. Cyclists are very small in terms of road users and can easily be missed in a glance, incurring </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">fatal</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> consequences</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">.</span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; orphans:0; text-indent:0pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Cyclists should beware of stopping on busy roads (for example to mend a puncture) or even very quiet roads where there is a high speed limit (e.g. 50 or 60 mph) even if the road is straight and visibility is good (e.g. on a town bypass). High speed diffe</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">rentials are very dangerous. This is clear to me where I am forced to walk, pushing my cycle uphill, on left hand bends, where the road is two way but no wider than two vehicles width. 'B' roads are often like this. Even walking, the cyclist is quickly uns</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">ighted as he proceeds around the bend. Thus with any vehicles coming up behind – if another vehicle comes the other way at the same moment, the one behind has </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">no where</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> to go and very little time to decide who to crash into.

Those with a limit of 70mph are u</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">nbelievable dangerous, yet I see people cycling on them. Again the speed differential is way too high to be safe, even wearing high visibility clothing. In the majority of cases there </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">is an alternative route for the cyclist.

The driver cannot understand why </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">the cyclist is on the road, rather than the cycleway. However, from the cyclists' point of view, he doesn't know it's there. He is mainly concentrating on the road in front of him and nothing over this side of the road has told him the cycle way is over th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">ere.

I am impressed with the Netherlands approach to cycle safety, but we cannot simply change all the roads and junctions in our towns and cities all at once. Nor all of London, for </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">that matter. My view is that cyclists must take responsibility for their own actions and remember they are a very small road user. If I can do as many miles without incident as I have, then safe cycling is possible, even without separated cycle paths and t</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">he wonderful Netherlands system. However, when I have come across them in the U.K., I have used them and rejoiced in them. They are becoming more common now and are a joy to use. HGV's are a danger to the cyclist, as are all vehicles, but particularly so. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The cyclist should be aware of this.

However, whatever can be done to improve the situation/road layout can only be a very good thing, as are other methods such as training, HGV mirror improvements etc. Keeping lorries off the roads at certain times/</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">places ,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> as the CTC is arguing, is not th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">e answer.
