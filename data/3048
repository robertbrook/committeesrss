Congratulations on securing the Secretary of State’s nomination to be chair of Monitor. We would like to ask you some questions about why you would like the job and what you see as your principal challenges when you start. Can we start at that very general level? What made you apply for the job? What do you see as your three key priorities?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dominic Dodd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Thank you for considering me. I have been chair at the Royal Free for the last four and a half years and on the board for the last seven and a half. In that period of time and, indeed, more recently, we have been working quite hard on questions I think everyone wrestles with about how to improve the patient model and the clinical model of care. We have been doing that in a way that is based on the principles of integrated care.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Through that process, working with the commissioners and providers, it has become quite clear to me as chair that there are a number of factors that are completely mission critical to it, such as whether the incentive system or the tariff system is well aligned between commissioners and providers in the service of patients. There are also some tricky issues of choice and competition—I am sure you will be very interested in those—and issues relating to mergers and acquisitions in our local patch. In short, there is a whole series of things that lie within the remit of Monitor. I have increasingly come to the view that how well Monitor performs in its remit is absolutely critical to the space for innovation locally that I think will be required, given the challenges ahead.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That is the mind, if you like. The heart side of it for me is that I feel passionately about the NHS. I am one of those people who feel that it is a defining achievement of a civilised society that we provide health care on the basis of need and not on the basis of ability to pay. It is difficult to be at the Royal Free and not deepen that passion, because of its pioneering history </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">in providing free health care—the clue is in the name. For me, I suppose, it is the collision between that sense of what the service needs and the passion to keep the ethos it is based on.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q2 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I will ask one supplementary and then open the questioning to others. If you were now writing the history of your tenure as chair of Monitor, what would you hope would be the key achievements that people would remember you for?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dominic Dodd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: At Monitor?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dominic Dodd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We may come to this later in questions about what the challenges are, but I think that a fundamental tenet of good governance is knowing how you define success. At the level of overall duty, that is very clear for Monitor—it is about protecting and promoting the interests of patients. I think that we all know what that means. When you think through the patient lens, it means “Don’t harm me. Keep it safe. Fix what is wrong with me, treat me well and make sure my services are sustainable and affordable.”</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">As a provider and as a commissioner, it is very easy to think about how you measure success against those things. As a regulator, you are a little bit more removed. One of the major challenges is to trace a path between those kinds of outcomes for patients, the behaviours that are intended to be encouraged by regulatory action and the regulatory levers, whether they are formal or informal. I would hope, working with the board, that we would be able to be incredibly clear about that path and would know whether we were making the necessary changes in the behaviour of commissioners, providers and the system as a whole that did in fact lead to outcomes that were desirable for patients. That would be my primary hope.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Secondly—and very importantly—for better or for worse, we are in a situation where we need to operate as a team nationally. The consequences of not acting as a team across the various agencies—between NHS England, the CQC, the TDA, Monitor and others—are confusion at the level of the commissioners and the providers on the ground. That is not in the interests of patients, so it is a duty for all of us to make sure that we are aligned. One of the things that I would hope to be able to do, were you to feel able to approve my nomination, would be to work with the board on pushing further the good work that I think is already being done on that front, to make sure that there is a shared view, which is clinically-based, about the way in which the NHS should evolve over time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I will add a third one and then stop, because I am sure you will want to ask other questions. I am a big believer in culture and tone in organisations and getting that right. I think it is extremely important that Monitor is independent, objective, analytical and evidence-based, but also that it demonstrates a really sharp understanding of the on-the-ground challenges of making change happen. I would want the combination of those two tones, if you like, to be recognised.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q3 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara Keeley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I have a general question that will help the Committee and then a couple of specific points. How has your past </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">career</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> prepared you for this demanding, high-profile role as head of a prominent regulator?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dominic Dodd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Clearly, the experience in my career that is most relevant is my time at the Royal Free. As I said, I have been there for seven and half years on the board and have been chair for the last four and a half. As a result of that, I have had experience of life in an NHS trust, as it was, and then of life in a foundation trust. I have had on-the-ground experience of pretty much all of the aspects of Monitor’s remit, be it FT authorisation, FT regulation, wrestling with tariff questions, or the issues of integrated care or choice and competition. In </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">fact, I think the only area I have had not had any experience of is the continuity of services regime, for which I am grateful. That would be the main experience that is relevant.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I am also on the board of UCLPartners. That has given me a much greater appreciation of the challenges of trying to align research, training and clinical service across a large population, and the challenge of thinking about the population and not thinking about the institutions. That has been a really interesting experience for me.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I have spent time in the private sector in a consulting capacity. There are aspects of that that I think are relevant. My experience was about independent or external perspectives and challenging perspectives to clients. I think that gave me a grounding in the things that one has to learn as a non-executive over time. I learned a number of things that are specifically relevant to how you make change happen, for example. Often it was by failure—we learn by getting things wrong. I would pick one example. If you want change to happen and you lead with costs and think about quality afterwards, it will not work. That is a lesson I learned in the private sector that I think is very relevant to the NHS.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There is also the specific experience of being the branch manager of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> office of the consulting firm I worked at, which gave me a sense of some of the particular dynamics of organisations such as Monitor that do not have a specific, tangible product or service and are more about analysis and decision making.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q4 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara Keeley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Your CV, which we have as notes from the Department of Health, lists you as having been an executive director of the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation for a year. Do you see yourself as being able to use your experience there to promote social enterprise within the NHS, which is being talked about quite a bit at the moment? You have not mentioned it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dominic Dodd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: No. I had a relatively short period of time there. I left the private sector full time in 2003 and had a period of time in the third sector. I think I had good learning. One thing there that was interesting goes back to the issue of how you measure success. How do you measure success in a charity, where you cannot measure it by money?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q5 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara Keeley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Was it a successful charity?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dominic Dodd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes, I think so. It is a very large foundation and is very active in sub-Saharan </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Africa</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, in particular. It has made some very tangible improvements in things such as the cost of antiretrovirals for children. Part of my concern there was to try to understand how judging success could be used in the way in which the foundation worked.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q6 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara Keeley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Could you address my specific point?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dominic Dodd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I do not have a particular agenda or feeling about what form of social enterprise or other forms of enterprise are appropriate. We can all think of third sector experiences in the NHS, such as the hospice movement, that have been fantastic for patients. I certainly think that, if commissioners faced with choices can see opportunities to improve services and reduce their costs from any sector, those should be considered.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q7 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara Keeley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> On that point, I looked up some figures around the charity. In one particular year, there was total expenditure of £53 million and only £27 million of grants made, so the ratio of costs to grants was not in the right direction. I do not think many people would look at those figures and think that was a very efficient charity, would they? Did you form that opinion when you were there?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dominic Dodd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: When I was there, we were in a period of building out the capabilities of the charity. It had around 40 people in it, so there was a lot associated with that. Obviously, the intent and purpose of having the money was to invest—that was absolutely the objective. I believe the numbers are a lot bigger now, but I am afraid I am not that close, and it was a number of years ago. There is this wrestle that one has between confidence about impact and amount of spend. That is a challenge that lots of charities face. The particular figures you quote may reflect its being in a transitional phase around that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q8 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara Keeley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Okay. You have talked quite a bit about your experience in the private sector. The longest period that you spent was with Marakon Associates, which is currently quoted on its website as saying that “</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">now more than ever, there is</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> an opportunity for …</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> healthcare companies to exploit the new market environment</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">” and that private health firms have the opportunity to capture and retain new consumers. A few minutes ago you told us that you feel passionately about the NHS and the provision of free health care, yet for a very long period of time—the biggest chunk of your experience—you worked with a firm that wants to exploit the market environment and to capture and retain new consumers for private health firms. That does not really stack up, does it?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dominic Dodd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Those are not my views. I am 10 years from the time when I was employed by Marakon.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q9 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara Keeley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> And you did not hold those views when you were there—you did not think that was a direction the organisation should be taking?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dominic Dodd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: That the organisation should be targeting health care? No, absolutely not. Ours was an advisory firm. Those are other people’s words on a website. They do not reflect my view.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q10 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara Keeley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So you disagree with private health care, do you?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dominic Dodd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: No. I go to back to the point I made before. I think the critical question is choices for patients and choices for commissioners. Competition—or a particular sector—is not the objective. It goes back to this path—the objective has to be patients and quality for patients, within the constraints of the costs we all have to work within. If there are good choices from the voluntary sector or from the private sector, that is fine—those should be considered. I note that my understanding is that there is no particular requirement for commissioners actually to tender and go for a competitive process if they have taken the right approach of thinking through what the needs of the local population are and whether competition will deliver anything. If they have concluded that it will not and have done that appropriately, they do not need to do that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara Keeley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> There are very mixed views about that issue.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q11 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Grahame M. Morris:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> In response to the first question from the Chairman, you mentioned new forms of innovation and so on. We have heard a little bit recently—not least from the Health Minister, Norman Lamb—about social investment, social enterprises and the mutual model. What are your thoughts about that—social investment that gives a return to the investors—within the NHS context? Do you have any particular views on that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dominic Dodd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I do not think I am close enough to the model and to the arguments to say a huge amount there. What I would say—I know that Monitor has done work on this—is that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">it is important that there are not artificial barriers, of whatever form, to people being considered. I know, for example, that there are thoughts about heavy working capital requirements for small voluntary organisations that may not be appropriate to the commissioning task at hand. Those are things that need to be addressed; I think the fair playing field review looked at them. I do not think it is for Monitor to have a preferred view about the model of care. It is for commissioners, particularly clinicians, working with providers and others in the local health economy, to figure out what works best for them.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q12 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara Keeley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I will run with my question.

That piece of work was really looking at the Nicholson challenge and, I think, concluding that even if we work on all the productivity opportunities that exist and there are new innovations, there will still be a real challenge and the quantum of innovation is therefore really important. A few examples of different models, both within the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and outside, were given.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q14 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara Keeley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> But I have to say that it did seem very directive.

I have not met the board of Monitor; I have met David Bennett on a couple of occasions as part of this process. I am giving you my impressions. I think that the work that has been done between NHS England and Monitor on guidance and case examples of how to think about choice and competition is a starting point for trying to clear up what is probably a good deal of confusion about what the rules really mean—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q16 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara Keeley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I do not think that is the impression that was left by what David Bennett said last week.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dominic Dodd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: As I said, I do not think we are misaligned on that point.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q17 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Grahame M. Morris:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I want to follow on that line, in relation to how the role of Monitor changed when we had the pause in the Health and Social Care Bill, which has since become an Act. It was originally set out as the sector regulator to drive forward competition, but after the pause it had to balance the tensions between being the sector regulator in driving competition and ensuring quality and integration. Personally, I am not quite sure how that works; I think the two are mutually exclusive. In relation to that, if we are looking at new ways of delivering </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">services—new providers—is it any concern of Monitor that the provider might be a private sector company, where there is no accountability? They do not have to give answers to freedom of information requests, provide board papers or answer questions about their governance arrangements. Is that not relevant to Monitor as currently constituted or in your mind, as the chairman driving it forward?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dominic Dodd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The change in remit that you describe is very clear. The duty is about promoting and protecting the interests of patients who use NHS services. Within that, there are particular duties in the competition area about addressing anti-competitive behaviour that is not in the interests of patients. I think that is very specific.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">My understanding is that Monitor’s response to that is largely a complaints-based, reactive response. For me, it goes back again to the whole question of how you define the success of Monitor. I would say that moving from a combined model of chair-chief executive to a separated model is an opportunity to further the work on asking the difficult questions about how the regulatory levers in all these areas are actually affecting behaviour and whether or not that behaviour is in the interests of patients.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q18 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Grahame M.

Could you let us know what your answer was?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dominic Dodd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Sure. I think I mentioned four things, in particular, as challenges and five priorities. I will try to run through those quite quickly. There is the challenge of the change in the scale and scope of the remit of Monitor as it goes from being the FT regulator to being the sector regulator as well, and there are the challenges that that kind of change gives in an organisation. There is the challenge of having a smooth transition between a combined CEO-chair model and a separated one. I will come back to that, but it is obviously an important move and one that should allow for an alignment of governance models in the national bodies.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The third one—this is in no particular order—is the challenge of aligning effectively with the other national bodies. For example, Monitor needs to align with the TDA on FT authorisation and to deal with the CQC on key issues where it is absolutely imperative that we work as one. Managing the relationship with NHS England is particularly important. I have mentioned before the consequences of not getting that right, which are profound and extremely unhelpful on the ground, so I thought that was a key challenge. I also talked about the challenge of navigating the potential tensions that might be perceived within the Monitor remit between its role as FT regulator and as sector regulator, the potential tensions, which have been alluded to, between integration and competition, and how all those things actually work to the benefit of patients. It was a month or so ago, but I think those were the four I came out with.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I have covered a couple of the priorities. A major and central priority for me in the role of chair would be to be absolutely clear about how we measured the success of Monitor. That is the first priority—the path between regulatory levers and behaviours through to outcomes for people. The second one is making sure that we step up the efforts on alignment. The third one I mentioned was about tone, so I have already mentioned three of them. We need to get the tone right between independence and objectivity and understanding the barriers on the ground. Another area is effecting a smooth transition from the chair-chief executive model.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The final one, which I think is also very important, is making sure that Monitor uses this as an opportunity to reflect on whether it has the board composition right and has the mix of independent perspectives that are necessary. As is the case everywhere, this is something that needs to be worked through, discussed with the chief executive and discussed with the board. I would bring into that the perspective from the Royal Free that senior clinical challenge and perspective on the board would be a good thing. I certainly think that that is something to work on. I know that David Bennett has been going through the process of trying to hire a chief medical adviser, although I am not entirely clear about where we are in that. I do not think it is inconsistent with that process, but we would want to take a view both internally and, perhaps, with external challenge, on whether we have the right mix of perspectives on the board that we need for the task ahead.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Back to competition, I think.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q30 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrew George:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> That is right. Earlier, you said in relation to the regulatory role of Monitor that you saw that you were there to identify behaviours that are to be encouraged; you have referred to that on a number of occasions. On the competition-collaboration continuum, which you also painted in your answer to Sarah’s question a moment ago, how much latitude do you feel Monitor has to interpret the regulations to encourage certain types of behaviour within that continuum?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dominic Dodd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Maybe it helps to get specific about the kinds of behaviours that are important. For example, I think the behaviour of considering choices, if there are relevant choices, is an important behaviour of commissioners as they look at how to improve services. There is the behaviour of looking critically at the current provision of services and whether they are delivering what is required.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q31 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What role do you think Monitor has in that? Is it specifically an issue for commissioners?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dominic Dodd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I was going to say that I would not pretend that I have a clear map. One thing that is important—it goes to the note on alignment—is that it would not be helpful if </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">there were different views in the national bodies about the sorts of behaviours that will deliver good outcomes. That is a question not just for Monitor but for NHS England and others. I am not suggesting that I have the list. There are lots of behaviours from things such as the Keogh work and the Berwick review that are widely held to be important. I give the example of looking critically at information in order to decide how you can improve, as opposed to looking defensively at information to justify why you are doing okay. I think those sorts of things are really important. The national bodies should agree on what behaviours we are all trying to have. My point is simply that with all the different levers we have we should be pulling them in the same direction.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q32 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrew George:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> A lot of the criticism of the legislation implies that we run the risk of ending up with a more fragmented health system. Of course, commissioners may use the opportunity of their commissioning powers to integrate where there is a failure to integrate and to enable collaboration in order to strengthen a service. For example, they can strengthen the viability of a district general hospital by making sure that it has the critical mass within it to sustain itself. Do you see Monitor’s role as being to recognise and support those types of trends?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dominic Dodd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Again, it is easier for me to think of it in a local context. One of the widespread issues—I think it is not just an issue for us—is that from a patient’s perspective it often feels as if no one is really fully managing your pathway and that you go from pillar to post repeating the same story. I know that the Committee has taken a lot of interest in integrated care. It seems to me that if commissioners have taken the view that a very integrated care approach to, say, the management of chronic conditions is a good one, the management of that pathway may itself be something that is amenable to choices. For example, people talk a lot about the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> stroke pathway as an example of collaboration. It is, but there were also choices to commissioners about who would have the hyper-acute one and how it would work.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I do not think that, inherently, choice and integration need to be in opposition. The key question to ask at all these stages is, “Is this a good thing for patients?” A huge advantage of the change that was made in the passage of the Bill through to the Act is that it is very clear that that is the overarching duty. Were you to approve my appointment, it would be incumbent upon me as chair to keep the focus on that and to make sure that that is clear.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q33 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrew George:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Finally, what lessons do you think you have learned from your years as chairman of the Royal Free? Let us take that as an example. On the one hand, there may be an opportunity to offer patients choice, which means that they may have choices outside an integrated foundation hospital, but from having served on the board of that hospital you may see the necessity of ensuring that you have a range of services there because they all need to hang together and you need to provide a range of services and procedures. Is there anything you can take from that that will help inform the decisions that Monitor makes in relation to the configuration of services going forward?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dominic Dodd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think I have learned lots of lessons—by things working out and things not working out. In this area generally, I take away a couple of really important ones. One is that change will not happen unless there is clinical leadership and buy-in. That is an absolutely essential requirement for change to happen on the ground. To address the specifics of your question, if it is the clinical view that these are the right things to do, that is the prerequisite for me.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The second thing, which is a challenge, is that I think the local health economy—including the relationships between social care, community care, hospitals and the commissioners—is the really critical unit. Yet we are working in a system where, as a patient, you walk over invisible boundaries all the time. The really key issue is local health needs and how those are provided for. That is the right unit at which to look at it. This may be more on the informal than on the formal side of Monitor’s powers, but in my view it would be good if Monitor could encourage both of those things.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q34 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrew George:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I did not intend to come in again, but you have raised a big question in your answer; I do not know whether it was intentional. In the earlier part of your answer, you indicated that if it was the collective clinicians’ view that a certain pathway should operate in that manner—I think you used words to that effect—the clinical view might well clinch any decision about the configuration of services. If that clinical view were to be in conflict with regulation that says that it would create a potentially anti-competitive set of circumstances, how would you address that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dominic Dodd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think that would be a problem, because the clinical view is very important. I have looked somewhat at the guidelines that Monitor provides—it has the capacity to provide a lot of informal guidance, too—and my understanding is that, if commissioners have considered whether or not competition for a particular service would help and have concluded that it would not, and they have done so appropriately, that is consistent with the rules.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q35 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you think the system is currently sufficiently open to the disruptive innovator?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dominic Dodd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: You can certainly point to past disruptive innovations in the large and in the small.

The </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> pathway for the homeless is a good example of disruptive innovation in a particular cohort of people. I am not sure that I know the answer to that question. What I am feeling is that the time available to us as a country to address the innovation that is required is relatively short. I am not sure that we have built up a track record in disruptive innovation, but the requirement for innovation, disruptive or otherwise—innovation that works—is going up.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q36 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Grahame M.

A little earlier, you mentioned that Monitor is reactive rather than proactive.

I think there is a broader point. My sense is that the direction of travel Monitor has been going through in its strategy is a kind of three lines of defence view. This is true both in competition and elsewhere. If things have gone wrong or rules that are in the Act or whatever have been broken, enforcement action is necessary. But the second line of defence is to try to see problems when they are coming up and to make sure that they do not get to the stage of enforcement action. I am suggesting—the direction I see Monitor going in is consistent with this—that there is a first level, which is to try to encourage, with whatever levers are within the remit, the behaviours that will work for the patient. I think there is something about making sure that it does not get to the stage where enforcement action needs to be taken.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q37 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Grahame M.

In some examples, particularly in rural areas, it can actually act against providing greater choice, because smaller, locally facing, charity-run and third-sector organisations are often forced out by a much larger organisation that can put together a more professional bid. Do you see anything that you can do in your role as chair to try to save some of this huge amount of waste and confusion? We had David Bennett here telling us that in many of the examples where things were put out to tender it was not necessary to put them out to tender, but that message is not getting through because nobody wants to be the test case in court. How can we actually resolve this, because it is wasting huge amounts of money?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dominic Dodd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is, and it is making people unnecessarily anxious and risk averse. I think there is a huge duty to have clear communication. That is one of the informal levers—clear communication, with worked examples.

If the message is not getting out—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q43 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Wollaston:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Why do you think that is?

My view is also that those kinds of decisions are best made by boards. As I said, I have not met the board yet, so a first step would be to think through those sorts of questions. At the Royal Free, the nursing director and the medical director are obviously very present, but I have made it the practice to ensure that we have the clinical divisional directors for each of the divisions at board meetings. That is to make sure that in areas where there are very complex interdependencies across different services we really understand what is the clinical view. Personally, I think that is important.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q47 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Valerie Vaz:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I am sorry for interrupting you, but what I am getting at really is, can you see yourself standing up to your chief executive and being independent?

I like to work by asking the chief executive and the executive team to propose what they think are the measures of success, the commitments that they wish to make and, importantly, what defines off-track performance that becomes a board issue. Then I like the board to debate that and to get to an agreement </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">on the rules of engagement. That means that, when there is an issue of off-track performance, we all know that the non-executive directors will get very actively involved in challenging that. We are not in a situation where this role exists. This is a role that would need to be worked out with David Bennett and with the board, but I think those kinds of rules of engagement are really important.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There is one further thing that I might add. The distinction between strategy and operations is very clear in a trust and in other settings. It is a bit trickier in an organisation such as Monitor, because a lot of the decisions are kind of “case law-y” or set precedents, so we need to try to work out exactly what that distinction is. It may well be that the board has a finely tuned view of that distinction, which would be great, but on the outside I do not have that. I think it is a critical thing to have to make sure that the chair is running the board and the chief executive is running the organisation and is empowered to do so.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q48 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Valerie Vaz:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Have you read the Francis report?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dominic Dodd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I have indeed.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q49 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Valerie Vaz:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You ha</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">v</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">e?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dominic Dodd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Absolutely I have.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q50 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Valerie Vaz:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Robert Francis made some </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">r</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">ecommendations about the regulators.

The most obvious one is about the structure of regulation and the CQC in its relationship to Monitor.

Both the CQC, with its evolving inspection regime, and Monitor, which is six months into its new remit, have a job of work on their hands. There is value to focus on each of those. For me, there are some profound issues about avoiding marking your own homework. We have one regulator, the CQC, that is focused solely on care quality and how that is managed. If it passes problems over to others to resolve, it is not involved in marking its own homework, which is a good thing. The underlying issue—the issue that Mid Staffs clearly demonstrated—was very poor co-ordination. I know that a lot of work has been done to try to get co-ordination at the working level, with memorandums of understanding between the two regulators. My understanding is that people feel those are working well.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">However, there are still key areas of overlap. Quality governance is a critically difficult issue. It is a legitimate interest of the CQC that it understands that, when it is inspecting, it is not </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">inspecting something that one day will be okay and the next day will not, so it needs to understand that quality governance is in the right place. Equally, when Monitor is judging whether foundation trust applicants are well run, for example, it needs to understand whether they are well run for managing quality. So there are areas of overlap, which need to be very closely managed. At the board level, I would be asking whether there was more that we could do to ensure that there was that alignment and that there was a seamless process in key areas of licensing and in authorisation, for example.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q53 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Valerie Vaz:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you see that you could actually try to resolve this issue? I am trying to get out of you that you will be more dynamic. The problem with Mid Staffordshire is that Monitor and CQC were involved. I know that is before your time, but I want to try to convey that the public will have confidence that with you at the helm this will not happen again.

I think there is scope for asking whether there are further things that one might do at board level to effect greater co-ordination. I have to say that, simply by moving to a chair-chief executive model, that aligns better and means that there may be more opportunity for governance to work effectively, so that is a help. As in many areas of the NHS, we are trying to ensure single processes but with multiple structures; that is the challenge. It is true at the local level and at the national level. We all have to work incredibly hard at that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q54 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Valerie Vaz:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> And to be ready to stand up.

I know there are trusts that have found it very challenging to go through SHA processes, TDA processes and Monitor processes, so I </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">understand the on-the-ground challenge of that. I also understand that Monitor has to be held to account for its decisions on authorisation, so it is important that it owns those decisions.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">My understanding is that there has been a considerable amount of thought about and work on how to avoid the situation where trusts are asked to do something with the TDA in the run-up and then to do exactly the same thing with Monitor; I think they called it trying to streamline the end-to-end process. One of my priorities would be to understand from both Monitor and the TDA how they felt all of that was going, but it is very important, in a system where it is sometimes quite difficult to pin down accountabilities, that it is very clear where the accountability for FT authorisation lies.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q58 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Charlotte Leslie:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Given that we are talking about public accountability, do you think the lines are drawn clearly enough at the moment, or do you think further clarification is needed?

I know the changes in the risk framework that were announced recently have a few more of what one might call the leading indicators. That is part of the general shift towards really trying to avoid things getting into problems. However, if there is a quality issue that needs fixing that is going to cause a financial issue, we should spend the money to fix the quality issue; I think that is something David Bennett has said and with which I totally agree. That has to be the right answer. Then we as the NHS team will figure out how to resolve the financial issue. It has to be that way round.

Those kinds of conflicts of interest are not untypical in regulators, and not untypical in other organisations as well. There is a range of mechanisms that one can use to deal with them. It is very important that the overarching duty of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">protecting patients and promoting patients’ interests is the arbiter of conflicts. It is also very important that you are transparent about conflicts, so that you describe what they are and let everyone know what they are, how you have approached them, how you have resolved them and what your thinking was. That is really important and allows you to be open to challenge, which is extremely important.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There are other mechanisms, ranging from what was originally thought of—Chinese walls—to separate structures.

I don’t think I am in a position to really understand what the full range of safeguards is currently, but that is certainly something I would want to understand.

While that is the general duty, we need to get a bit more specific about what that means. I am used to thinking of it as being good outcomes, safety, a good experience of care and sustainable care in terms of affordability and efficiency. Those are in the interests of patients. Others may have different views, but I think those are consistent with the way in which NHS England is thinking. Just throwing it out as a general duty does not resolve everything.

I did not quite realise just how complex the whole thing is. It seemed that a tremendous amount of work needed to be undertaken there in order to make it fathomable. Leaving that aside, you will know that one of the main concerns about the setting of the tariff is that it does not create a climate in which there </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">is an unintentional opportunity for certain sectors, particularly the private sector, to cherry-pick the easier work. I wonder to what extent in your previous work, certainly with the Royal Free, you have engaged with that and in that side of the debate, because it will be a very significant piece of work that Monitor will be assisting in resolving in the coming months.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dominic Dodd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes; I know there has been a debate about the cherry-picking issue. It is clearly not right that tariffs that are blended across different case complexity should be paid to providers that for clinical reasons are dealing only with the simpler cases. I will say a couple of things on the price environment. It is very important that prices and costs match and that there is an understanding of activity. That is incredibly important for setting the right prices, but it is also incredibly important for running trusts and for commissioning. If you have done that well, in a way you legislate out some of the issues of cherry-picking. That is the first thing.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The second thing is that pricing is a lot about signalling. I feel that people have the opportunity to think through what is the unit that is actually priced. For example, are there opportunities to have a more year-of-care-type tariff, which would be more appropriate for chronic diseases? Should we think about having capacity-type tariffs for A and E issues? Those are the sorts of opportunities we need to think about. What you are describing is the HRG-level tariff—the payment-by-results tariff. I do not think that is the right one size fits all; obviously it is not.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q73 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara Keeley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I want to come back to a couple of points, because I see some conflict in them. Earlier, you said that you feel passionately about the NHS and the provision of free health care but, as I pointed out to you, the bulk of your career experience comes from a company in the private sector that sees the current time as a prime opportunity for health care companies to exploit the market and to capture and retain new consumers for private health firms. That does seem like a conflict to me.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">              </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">You said you found some problems with tone and communication in what David Bennett said last week, because that seemed to be in conflict with what you thought Monitor’s role should be, which was to work with clinicians and commissioners, not to set directions. If that sort of conflict with David Bennett continued, to what extent do you feel you would challenge him to protect free health care provision in the NHS? Would you actually keep him if you could not resolve such issues?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dominic Dodd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: On the first question, I wanted to move out of the private sector because I wanted something where I could feel a greater connection of mission: that is a personal thing. I have no problem with the private sector—I think well-run companies and organisations are very important to the economy—but it was a personal decision.

My understanding is that that was an illustration of an innovation. I do not think it was intended to mean, “This is the solution that you must implement.” It is certainly not within the remit of Monitor to be able to decide that anyway.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q77 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara Keeley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> In my view, that is where things are going wrong. It if it is not part of Monitor’s role, the chief executive should not be coming out with that. You as an organisation should not be making pronouncements on things that are not within your role. Frankly, it would be up to you as chair to make sure that that did not happen. I am asking you whether you are strong enough to stand up to that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dominic Dodd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think I have addressed the issue in the way I think about it, which is that the board needs to define clearly what success means for Monitor and to hold the management team to account for performing against that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q78 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara Keeley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> If they have got the tone and communication wrong, what will you do?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dominic Dodd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: That is something we want to work through—absolutely.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q79 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> But in that set of circumstances, if you agreed as a board what the tone and objectives of the organisation were going to be and either you as chair or your colleagues on the board were not content that the tone was right, measured against the agreed yardstick, presumably the performance of the executive team would become a matter for the board.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dominic Dodd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Absolutely. I am used to the situation where, when the non-executive team appraise the chief executive, they do it with 360° feedback internally and with external feedback but also, importantly, against what was agreed we would define success as. In that way, you can have relatively objective discussions about how we are doing. That is good governance and is certainly what I would want to do.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q80 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> But good governance also involves setting the parameters within which the executive team works—and enforcing them.
