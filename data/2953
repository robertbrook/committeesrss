The crisis has disproportionately disadvantaged young people’s transitions into work in both the UK and around the rest of the EU. The risks of economic and social ‘scarring’ are profound. People who experience extended unemployment at the start of their lives are much more likely to have a range of negative outcomes including; lower lifetime income, poorer old age, increased likelihood of experiencing unemployment again in future, more negative health outcomes etc. There is growing evidence that they are also less likely to vote and become disengaged in other ways. If we accept that these are problematic outcomes, there is important scope for the EU to provide funding. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="2" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">So far, governments have been key drivers in the implementation of initiatives to help young workers during the crisis. Active labour market policies (ALMPs) have been a feature of almost all EU Member States since 2008, with a notable increase in attempts to address the particular difficulties faced by young people in their labour market transitions. These initiatives (some of which are outlined below) can be highly effective, but are increasingly under threat as a result of austerity measures. There is a clear role for the EU to support country-specific initiatives where this is the case. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="3" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">There is good evidence that around the EU the labour market transitions of a wide range of young people of all levels of skills and qualifications have become more extended (i.e. it takes longer to find a secure job that requires appropriate skills), more precarious (i.e. people do a bigger range of jobs than they previously did before they find a secure job) and harder (i.e. it is harder to find any job, let along a secure one). This was a phenomenon of youth employment prior to 2008 and it has become worse since then in most EU member states. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="4" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Importantly, it is central to my submission that the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">quality</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> of opportunities open to young people is as important as the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">quantity</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> of jobs and training available. There is growing evidence that people who experience extended periods of ‘precariousness’ in their labour market transitions experience similar scarring effects as those who experience simple unemployment. In other words, if your early experiences of the labour market are in moving in and out of work, including the growing phenomenon of moving between paid and unpaid work, there is likely to be a negative effect on your life chances, including engagement in civic society. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">How do you think that the EU can best ‘add value’ to Member States’ efforts to tackle unemployment? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="5" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Each member state has different mechanisms for regulating the labour market. It is important that the relevant bipartite (employers and unions) and tripartite (employers, unions and the State) are involved in the implementation of any initiatives. There will be particular challenges in countries such as the UK which have very weak mechanisms of labour market regulation. It is important to note that absence of collective regulation of labour markets is not the norm around the EU, so the proverbial ‘tail’ should not wag the ‘dog’. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="6" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">There is good evidence that bipartite and tripartite forums have been effective at generating sector, regional and nationally specific responses to tackle youth unemployment (examples given below), but that funding for such initiatives has often been reduced or removed as the financial context has become more challenging. The EU should look to continue to provide funding for such initiatives in order to allow for sector, regional and national flexibility in responses. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="7" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">In loosely regulated labour markets such as the UK, the EU will have to work with national funders and with the government to provide support for mechanisms such as apprenticeship programmes, subsidies for training, and possibly subsidies for employers to recruit young people. Attention should be paid to the fact that here there is a serious challenge of engaging employers in such initiatives and although increased attention has been paid to this, there is still much work to do. One proposal could be to consider using such funding to encourage employers to engage with such national initiatives. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Is there sufficient disaggregation in EU measures to tackle youth unemployment between, for example, support for young people classified </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">as being not in education, employment or training (‘NEETs’), support for newly qualified graduates looking for work, and general career guidance? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="8" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">No. This is a serious weakness of much of the available data. The first problem is that we don’t really understand how the crisis has impacted different groups and there is scope explore further the particular impacts of the crisis on young workers with different levels of education, skills and training. There does seem to be evidence that indicates that this crisis is affecting young workers across a wide range of skills levels, which is a marked difference from the pre-2008 situation. If this pattern persists, it raises very considerable concern for the future integration of a wide range of young people into work and broadly into civil society. But what we know less about is whether young people at, for example, higher levels of qualification are equally affected in the long term by periods of unemployment and precarious work. It appears they may be, but it may equally be that their higher levels of qualification allow them to be more resilient in, say, 20 years time. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="9" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Another area that is problematic is that initiatives to help young people at different stages of their training and labour market transitions often fail to consider what happens to them at the end of the initiative. A good example that is of particular concern is what happens to people at the end of apprenticeships or training programmes. Support to provide high-quality opportunities for people who have received training is crucial to avoid them having to move out of the labour market or into low-skill, poor-quality, precarious jobs. Similarly, ensuring that support for the long-term unemployed </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">does</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> not just cease at the end of a particular programme is essential.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="10" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Returning to a point made previously, it is important that, where they exist, mechanisms of labour market regulation (tripartite bodies, sectoral collective bargaining, etc.) are involved in developing, implementing and monitoring initiatives that are sufficiently flexible to address the specific needs of a range of employers and workers. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Are the EU’s accounting, monitoring and evaluation procedures sufficient to be able to determine whether EU funded projects to tackle youth unemployment have been successful or not?

There </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">are</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> inevitably some deadweight costs associated with any labour market intervention (in other words, funding may go to employers who would have taken on, trained etc. a young person even without the funding). A central question in evaluation initiatives has been to try to evaluate that deadweight cost. However, it is nearly impossible to do well and requires longitudinal data. What </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">tends to happen is that such initiatives</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> are changed after a few years or even months, which does not allow for longitudinal analysis.

Particular issues might include evaluating whether the variety of schemes is appropriate (too many, too few?) to address the challenges facing young workers. It is also important that in countries where there have been new measures to help young workers as a direct result of the crisis that these programmes are evaluated within an appropriate time span.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">How do you think the funds allocated through the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) and the European Social Fund (ESF) could best be spent? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="13" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Expanding training and apprenticeship opportunities is widely recognised by member states and by social partners as an effective measure to promote youth employment and develop work-relevant skills. In some countries, debate has emerged over the employment rights of young people engaged in internships and training. Many countries have increased the incentives for employers to offer vocational training placements and apprenticeships as a central strategy to helping young workers. Although some attention needs to be paid to ensuring there are appropriate job vacancies at the end of a period of training, most of the evaluation of the effectiveness of these programmes by a range of stakeholders is very positive.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="14" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The danger of responding in a crisis situation is that labour market interventions may stand at odds to other policies such as taxation, education or social welfare. Priority should be given to policies that deliver labour market policy objectives. Providing robust support for apprenticeship programmes seems a particularly effective policy for young people because they have the dual benefit of both developing the work appropriate skills so needed by employers, while also developing and providing opportunities for young people. The national economy is also likely to benefit if such initiatives take place on a wide scale because of a general tendency to upskill the workforce.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="15" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Overall, governments’ policies towards young workers have tended to emphasise the importance of getting young people into work, no matter the quality of the jobs available. Comparatively little emphasis has been placed on concerns over the impact of precarious work on young people. Indeed, in some countries, governments have chosen to remove or reduce employment protections for young workers so as to increase hiring opportunities. This is a point of serious concern in the long-term. There is a danger of creating and deepening divisions between generations and of young people being disproportionately disadvantaged as a consequence of the crisis. The insecurity associated with precarious work sets up the very real possibility that problematic early experiences of work may feed through into reduced opportunities later in life and again raises the danger of disengaging young people from civic society.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="16" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The impact of austerity measures on programmes to support young workers is clearly of concern across Member States.

The exception is where trade unions are involved in collective bargaining or other bipartite/tripartite mechanisms for labour market regulation (establishing apprenticeships in countries such as Germany and the Netherlands, for example). Here, the youth forums of those unions are often involved through internal representation mechanisms. Beyond that, I have found few examples of youth groups pro-actively being engaged. This seems to me to be a democratic deficit that should be addressed. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">How can the EU and Member States embrace new technologies and new methods of working to combat youth unemployment? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="18" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">New technologies and new methods of working can be used in many ways. But I would caution against assuming they are a panacea. A good example is the widespread move towards provision of careers information online in England. My research indicates that this move, combined with other changes to funding of information, advice and guidance (IAG) for young people, has been extremely problematic and has led to widespread disengagement of schools and young people from robust provision of IAG. Undoubtedly, for example, some training and skills provision can be delivered online. And there may be ways to engage disadvantaged young people through social media. But young people need support and guidance during these difficult transitions into the labour market that cannot be provided online. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">15 October 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
