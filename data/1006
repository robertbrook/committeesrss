To deny prisoners the right to vote was to lose an important means of teaching them democratic values and social responsibility and ran counter to democratic principles of inclusiveness, equality and citizen participation and was inconsistent with the respect for the dignity of every person that lay at the heart of Canadian democracy and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="31" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">With regard to the second objective of imposing appropriate punishment, the government had offered no credible theory about why it should be allowed to deny a fundamental democratic right as a form of State punishment.

The first objective, that of enhancing civic responsibility and respect for the rule of law, related to the promotion of good citizenship. The social rejection of serious crime reflected a moral line which safeguarded the social contract and the rule of law and bolstered the importance of the nexus between individuals and the community. The ‘promotion of civic responsibility’ might be abstract or symbolic, but symbolic or abstract purposes could be valid of their own accord and should not be downplayed simply for being symbolic. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="33" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">As regards the second objective, that of enhancing the general purposes of the criminal sanction, the measure clearly had a punitive aspect with a retributive function. It was a valid objective for Parliament to develop appropriate sanctions and punishment for serious crime. The disenfranchisement was a civil disability arising from the criminal conviction. It was also proportionate, as the measure was rationally connected to the objectives and carefully tailored to apply to perpetrators of serious crimes. The disenfranchisement of serious criminal offenders served to deliver a message to both the community and the offenders themselves that serious criminal activity would not be tolerated by the community. Society, on this view, could choose to curtail temporarily the availability of the vote to serious criminals to insist that responsibility and respect for the rule of law, as goals worthy of pursuit, were prerequisites to democratic participation. The minority referred to the need to respect the limits imposed by Parliament and to be sensitive to the fact that there may be many possible reasonable and rational balances.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="34" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">In </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">South Africa</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">, the Constitutional Court unanimously decided</span><a name="_ftnref18"></a><a href="#_ftn18">[18]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> that the right to vote by its very nature imposed positive obligations upon the legislature and the executive, and that the Electoral Act had to be interpreted in a way that gave effect to constitutional declarations, guarantees and responsibilities. Sachs J noted that many democratic societies impose voting disabilities on some categories of prisoners. He recognized that limitations might be imposed upon the exercise of fundamental rights, provided that they were, amongst other things, reasonable and justifiable. The question whether legislation barring prisoners would be justified under the Constitution was not raised in the proceedings, and the Court emphasized that the judgment was not to be read as preventing Parliament from disenfranchising certain categories of prisoners. In the absence of such legislation, prisoners had the constitutional right to vote, and neither the Electoral Commission nor the Constitutional Court had the power to disenfranchise them.

In our last Report, we noted that the Government intended to consider the issue of prisoners' voting rights in a two-stage consultation which was expected to be completed in January 2008. A legislative solution was due to follow, after May 2008.

We were surprised to read that the Government was not convinced about the need for legislative reform. The Grand Chamber judgment is clear.

In 2006, Ireland passed legislation to enable all prisoners to vote by post in the constituency where they would ordinarily live if they were not in prison.

In our previous reports, we have drawn attention to a number of cases where significant delay in implementation has tarnished the otherwise good record of the United Kingdom in responding to the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. For the most part, these cases have been legally straightforward, but politically difficult. This case appears destined to join a list of long standing breaches of individual rights that the current Government, and its predecessors, have been unable or unwilling to address effectively within a reasonable time frame.

However, the Court stressed that withdrawal of the franchise is a very serious step and gave guidance on the types of offences which might rationally be connected with such a step. We are not persuaded that automatic disenfranchisement based upon a set period of custodial sentence can provide the "discernible link between the conduct and circumstances of the individual" and necessity for the removal of the right to vote required by the Grand Chamber.

If the Government continues to neglect its duty under Article 46 ECHR to remove the blanket ban on prisoners voting, further cases will arise. We consider that the longer the ban remains in place the greater the incentive will be for existing prisoners - and in particular, if the ban remains in place at the general election, those prisoners denied </span><span style="color:#333333; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">the right to vote in the election - to bring further applications to the European Court of Human Rights challenging the blanket ban. The Court in Hirst made clear that it was making no judgment on the decision to remove the right to vote in respect of Mr Hirst, but only that the blanket ban was disproportionate. It did not award Mr Hirst any "just satisfaction" or compensation. The Convention is a living instrument and the Court's position on prisoner voting rights will continue to evolve.

The Government, in its recent correspondence with us and the Committee of Ministers has been keen to emphasise that the ongoing breach of the Convention cannot affect the legality of the forthcoming election.

The UK is a dualist legal system in which international law obligations must be translated into domestic law via Parliament. Therefore, whilst the Government accepts that the Court in</span><span style="color:#333333; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="color:#333333; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Hirst v UK (No 2)</span><span style="color:#333333; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="color:#333333; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">found that section 3 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 is not compliant with its international law obligations under the Convention, the domestic law continues in force.

However, without reform the election will happen in a way which will inevitably breach the Convention rights of at least part of the prison population. This is in breach of the Government's international obligation to secure for everyone within its jurisdiction the full enjoyment of those rights. We consider that the Government's determination to draw clear distinctions between domestic legality and the ongoing breach of Convention rights shows a disappointing disregard for our international law obligations.</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; margin:0pt"><span style="color:#333333; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">2010  Excerpts from Oral Evidence of the Rt Hon Kenneth Clarke MP, Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice</span><a name="_ftnref30"></a><a href="#_ftn30">[30]</a></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; margin:0pt"><span style="color:#333333; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q36 </span><span style="color:#333333; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span><span style="color:#333333; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span><span style="color:#333333; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="color:#333333; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lord Dubs:</span><span style="color:#333333; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="color:#333333; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">I wonder if I could raise the vexed question of prisoners' voting rights. Could I say, and I'm sure I'm not allowed to say it, that as long as there's a coalition Government, I think you two are the good guys, okay? Would you care to comment on the issue of prisoners' voting rights, which I know has raised a wave of hysteria out of all proportion to the issue?</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; margin:0pt"><span style="color:#333333; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr Kenneth Clarke MP</span><span style="color:#333333; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">: Shall I kick off? The hysteria is rather late coming. The relevant judgment is five years old. To my recollection, the previous Government carried out at least two consultation processes on how they were going to implement it. I have no doubt that because of some of the reaction, in the end they came to no conclusions, so we do have to come to a conclusion on this. We have a mounting number of cases against us and we have to come to some conclusions, otherwise we'll have the absurd situation whereby we're still considering whether or not to comply. We're not there yet, but some court will start awarding damages to all these people making claims against us. If there's one thing that will stoke up public fury even higher, it is if people start getting awarded damages for some breach of their human rights by not being allowed to vote. We're having to consider how to implement the legal obligation and I think there's no point in getting away from the legal obligation. The fact is the extent of the legal obligation is a little confused. We've now got two judgments and various comments both from British and European courts, but two European judgments that aren't really consistent with each other. Compliance with these judgments by different members of the Council of Europe has been very varied. We're by no means the only one that is a long way behind, but we're going to have to come to a conclusion as soon as we can do so. The hysteria was slightly provoked by some rather extreme fears that people had in Parliament. I have to be cautious because the Government has to take a considered view on all this, but people who had the idea that their local government elections were going to be dominated by rapists, murderers and all the rest of it were taking a rather strong view of where we're likely to go. It's the blanket ban on all prisoners having the vote that was not upheld by the European Court. I hesitate on this occasion to go into the nuances of what lies below that—that has yet to be decided. I heard some of the fears expressed in the Chamber of the House of Commons. I didn't think anything was going to occur of the kind that was causing such alarm to quite a lot of my colleagues.</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; margin:0pt"><span style="color:#333333; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lord Lester of Herne Hill:</span><span style="color:#333333; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="color:#333333; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">I don't know whether you know this, but Cyprus and Ireland, which are not directly bound, overnight implemented it simply by giving postal votes. Hong Kong in its own way did, and for some reason there was no fuss in those jurisdictions at all. Of course the Committee of Ministers will be considering this in a couple of weeks' time, and indeed some of the officials who are on that committee on the enforcement mechanism are sitting behind you.

I hope we make progress in the next fortnight but I can't guarantee that. I am aware of that. There will be a fuss here. I have not the slightest doubt. On the actual mechanics of voting, I don't see any problem at all. Prisoners on remand can vote now. Not many of them bother to do so, but prisoners on remand do vote by post if they want to. Facilitating the vote is not really the problem. They are usually registered in their home constituency; they are not all registered in the prison where they happen to be currently and involuntarily residing. A remand prisoner just casts a vote if he or she wants in his or her home constituency. I don't think anyone's ever complained about that, probably because people aren't even aware of it. Of course, there is no doubt that they should be allowed to vote, because they haven't been convicted of anything; they are being held pending trial.</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; margin:0pt"><span style="color:#333333; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">2011 Excerpts from Oral Evidence of Professor Jeremy Waldron</span><a name="_ftnref31"></a><a href="#_ftn31">[31]</a></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Q57 Lord Lester of Herne Hill: To be precise about it, it was the first protocol to the Convention that introduced what is called the political democracy guarantee, from which the right to vote has been interpreted.

But is it not right that under our constitutional system, as in New Zealand as well, we have an international obligation binding upon all three branches, including Parliament, to abide by our treaty obligations?
