Yet virtually the whole of CCS industrial policy development and industrial advice to DECC is coming from power sector sources,  and those key expert process-industry companies  are notable for their near-absence (despite them already being visibly the companies of choice for conducting the proper detailed ‘FEED’ design studies for the CCS Demonstration projects) , most notably in the recent CCS Cost Reduction Task Force (CRTF) convened by the CCSA on DECC’s behalf, and also inthe type of consultancy organisations DECC are commissioning to provide key CCS cost data and advice.

So the ‘not a powerplant’ cachet is technically meaningless.     </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">The current Energy Bill is regulating and reforming half an equation</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">, leaving a large ‘elephant in the room’. Nowhere is this more important than in CCS, where it turns out that the high pressure, oxygen-free CCS processes </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">involved in fuel gas processing and manufacture are at least an order of magnitude cheaper per tonne of CO2 than CCS on powerplants. In other words, a gas-fired powerplant can be partially decarbonised, more efficiently and cost-effectively, via its fuel supply, most particularly via the manufacture  of low-C SNG fuel gas from partially biogenic feedstocks (including lower-cost, technically-difficult bio-wastes) as described in 6.3 i) and ii) above,  and without any of the multiple resulting problems involved in housing CCS plant on-site (including potential partial loss of the operational flexibility </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">that will be so vital to</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> balancing the wildly fluctuating outputs from DECC’s  planned wind and other RE fleets).  But DECC have apparently never asked that question.  Mr Anthony Day (consultant’s) parallel submission to this Call puts detailed numbers to such an SNG production scheme, based on a mix of well-proven British current and ‘heritage’ technology, and I warmly commend it to the Committee as an outstanding cost-effective and fully-practical decarbonised (low-C) flexible energy technology with an extensive range of end-uses via the paid-for gas grid, which in my experienced professional opinion is worthy of priority policy support.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">11. From an industrial policy point of view, the UK relinquished any </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">plant technology and manufacturing</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> (as opposed to mere site hosting) lead in the leading RE sources of large-scale windfarms and solar decades ago. However thanks to its long nationalised-industry fossil fuel and process heritage (including the academic sector), and the global immaturity of the sector, CCS is one of the few clean energy technology areas in which the UK could credibly become a significant global player. However this vital potential lead has been frittered by 8 years of HMG policy vacillation and is rapidly ebbing away unless more resolute action is taken to create a functioning, rapidly-growing UK CCS industry and supply chain (using incentives funding diverted from less cost-effective and fundamentally technically unnecessary RE activities –see 1,3 and 4 above).</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">12. Another issue that has increased CCS costs and held it back in UK is the inexplicable, nonsensical  arbitrary performance target of 90% CO2 capture target set by DECC for both the CCS Demo plants and all R&amp;D activities. This onerous target is </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; text-decoration:underline">particularly</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> technically challenging to achieve in a plant with varying output (ramping, cycling) and during startups/shutdowns as required for real UK grid operation.  But the UK  EPS CO2 regulation permits 420 grams/kWh (tonnes/MWh) (unabated natural gas CC powerplant equivalent) , which is equivalent to only 60% capture even for 100% coal feedstock, and even less with biomass blends! This artificial restriction (which exceeds </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">2050</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> power-sector fleet targets!) should be disbanded immediately.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">13. Further cost reduction opportunities are being lost because of existing DECC policy and incentives mechanisms focus on simplistic ‘single-technology’ solutions. Whereas some of the best low-cost ‘low-hanging fruit’ is in hybrid applications such as hybrid fossil/biomass fuelled plant with partial CCS, and in flexible co-production of electric power with another product such as fuels and chemicals – ‘the Prius of large decarbonised energy production’.  But most of these would not qualify for full incentives under the ‘over-rigid’ qualification rules currently built into the planned EMR decarbonisation incentives process. Notably, Summit Power of the US is already developing a large power/fertiliser co-production complex in Texas, but did not offer this efficient combination for the ‘Caledonian Power’ DECC CCS Demo Plant bid.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">14. The combination of large scale (partial) biomass fuelled energy conversion and CCS technology, BECCS, offers a unique credible affordable, low-risk route to a near-future practical C-negative </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">technology, far superior in both cost and risk to most other C-negative technology proposals such as Direct Air Capture (DAC) which again, breaks fundamental chemical engineering design principles (but several orders of magnitude worse than for powerplant post-capture). Given the huge potential strategic global importance of such a capability, it deserves a high priority in both direct RD&amp;D funding and in well-designed full-scale, longer-duration decarbonisation market incentives that fully reward CO2 removal beyond zero, ideally at an enhanced incentive rate.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">August 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
