The Secretary of State for Wales appeared before us three times during that period to discuss her/his responsibilities, and each time we questioned her/him about how they are working within government, alongside the business community, and with the Welsh Government to promote economic growth in Wales. In January 2013 the Secretary of State for Wales gave evidence alongside the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills on the future of the steel industry in Wales, where we examined whether government policies were having a negative impact on an industry that remains very important for the Welsh economy. As described above, much of our report on Broadband Services in Wales focused on the role of the Wales Office, in respect of a service which is critical to a well-functioning modern economy.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="15" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; orphans:0; text-indent:0pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">In relation to the devolution settlement, the Wales Office is tasked with working with the Treasury and other Government departments to respond to the Silk Commission Part 1 Report on financial devolution in Wales. We have continued to closely monitor the Silk process, including by taking evidence from Mr Silk in December 2012 shortly after the publication of his report. Prior to that session we travelled to Belfast and Edinburgh to learn about financial devolution in Northern Ireland and Scotland and how it compared to the Silk proposals for Wales. We also used our twice-yearly sessions with the Secretary of State to question him about the Government’s view on the Silk report. We will maintain a close interest in the development of the Silk proposals over the coming year, including an evidence session with the Secretary of State about the Government response to Silk Part 1 and evidenec with Mr Silk about the publication of his Part 2 report in March 2014.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="16" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; orphans:0; text-indent:0pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">The Committee also questioned the Secretary of State on other constitutional issues, such as the decision to refer the Local Government Byelaws (Wales) Bill to the Supreme Court.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="17" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; orphans:0; text-indent:0pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">One of the Wales Office’s objectives is to represent Wales within the UK Government and, again, we use our twice-yearly evidence sessions with the Secretary of State to monitor its work in this respect. For example, in our most recent evidence session in July 2013, we questioned the Secretary of State about his involvement within Government about decisions to change the education system in England which had consequences for Wales. We also enquired about the UK Devolution Minister Network which had been established by his predecessor.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; orphans:0; text-indent:-18pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Expenditure and performance of the Wales Office (Task 3)</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; orphans:0; text-indent:-18pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="18" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; orphans:0; text-indent:0pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">The vast majority of the money voted to the Wales Office is passed through to the Welsh Government as a block grant.
