The importance of Government being seen to openly share information with the people it represents is paramount, particularly in times of austerity when there is a great deal of debate about welfare reform, cuts to services and concern that facts given to the media by Members of Parliament might be incorrect. Enabling anyone to access the full factual statistics, given in a useful way, helps to reduce the scepticism held by individuals towards the Government.
