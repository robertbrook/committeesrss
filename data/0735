After establishing clear attitudinal tendencies towards personal responsibility and interest in responding to incentives, the project undertook a trial in a neighbourhood in Timperley, western Greater Manchester. The Phase 1 report (Bichard and Kazmierczak, 2009) presented clear evidence that an incentive scheme based on non-cash rewards could be successful.

This is particularly true when the decision requires respondents to spend their own money. Hence, the Environment Agency concluded that there was merit in the proposition, but that a limited ‘proof of concept’ trial needed to be mounted to show that householders could be persuaded to buy energy or flood measures in response to an offer of a reward. Thus, the project team designed a pilot directed at a limited number of streets in a flood-threatened area. Although the project team examined ways of persuading householders to purchase flood protection and energy efficiency measures in addressing the effects of climate change this paper mainly considers the aspects related to energy efficiency measures.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="10" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The attitudinal survey of the Timperley residents showed a marked similarity to other telephone and door to door surveys that have been carried out by the project team since 2009. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Following dissemination of the Phase 1 report, the Salford team were asked by the Agency to test the conclusions of the attitudinal work by running a limited trial in a few streets. The district of Timperley in western Greater Manchester was chosen as it was assessed as flood-threatened, did not have an organised green community group, and was likely to produce sufficient numbers of owner-occupiers with enough disposable income to participate.

First, residents were visited by a green community group acting on behalf of the researchers who tested householders’ attitudes toward climate change, attribution of responsibility, and interest in investing in property-level measures in return for some non-cash rewards. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="12" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Residents who expressed interest in the reward scheme were given a combined flood and energy survey of their home.

However, it produced some interesting and unexpected results. Half of the householders agreed to a full energy and flood audit. This is far higher than one energy company achieved after offering to provide this for free to their own customer base. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="15" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The residents who accepted the rewards chose fruit and vegetables, a season ticket for the tram, a garden makeover and a beauty session in return for buying items including a new boiler, space heaters and insulation. About 20% of those householders who accepted the home surveys went on to make a purchase and hence were eligible for the rewards. The average spend by the residents was just over £1,000 while the cash value of the rewards was £840 showing that it is possible to motivate reluctant householders, promote social value initiatives, lower carbon emissions and provide measures at less than market prices for the material and the labour all at the same time.

In addition, programmes that assume standard contact points will often fail many householders who have different needs at different times. For suppliers involved in delivering the Green Deal, this finding could have significant cost implications. Commissioning bodies would do well to ensure that suppliers have factored sufficient contact time into their delivery programmes to accommodate this tendency. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="18" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">A further finding was that the strategies employed in the trial lead to a significant number (around half of all participating households) allowing survey teams through their doors. The project team concluded from this that time spent talking to householders at their own property, offering tailored information (in response to questions) from a trusted source, and with the promise of rewards that capture the imagination were an effective combination to overcome doubts about the proposition. The information in the questionnaire, listing as it did all of the common interventions for energy and flooding, seemed to help residents to understand the nature of the request and lead many to move to the next stage. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="19" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The second decision point, choosing to act on the report recommendations, was facilitated by a hand delivered copy of the report, and a brief face-to-face explanation of its contents. This was supplemented by follow-up telephone calls to those who were slower to make up their minds. The evidence at this stage is that those who opted to purchase measures were probably already convinced that they wanted energy saving products either through the early interactions with the co-ordinator, or by talking to the energy surveyor who also spent time answering residents questions while on the premises. Persuasion beyond this point was more difficult, probably because of technical and financial barriers were beyond the abilities of the co-ordinator to overcome. However, it is conceivable; even likely, that there will be residents in future programmes who would need encouragement to read/re-read their reports and make a decision, possibly with supplementary advice from their trusted source of information.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="20" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The issue of trust was also raised by some residents who commented that being approached by a community group with University backing reassured them that there was no commercial ‘catch’ to the scheme. Nevertheless, one resident reported that he still heard other residents say they were suspicious of the scheme because they had recently had to contend with many energy companies trying to get them to switch providers or buy energy saving products and this had made them defensive.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="21" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The factors that worked against the acceptance to buy energy measures included a perception that the cost of energy saving measures was prohibitive, and a belief (against the surveyor’s finding) that the measures the resident had in place were sufficient. Another reason for declining the offer was the disturbance that would be caused from (for example) moving possessions out of the loft space, or the mess caused by cavity wall insulation work. One resident was suspicious of cavity wall insulation and thought it would cause his walls to become damp, a common concern although rarely justified. These are all well documented reasons for inaction on energy conservation. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="22" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Some residents who declined to participate in the door-to-door questionnaire, and others who failed to respond to their audit reports said that they could not spare the time to get involved in the project. While some may have used this response to avoid becoming involved on something that did not interest them, others who said were interested in climate change and were prepared to participate in the project found that they could not devote the time to consider the issues. A few were motivated to select measures and install them in their own time thus avoiding the need to wait for contractors. Others said that they were positively influenced by their interaction with the project and would, if time allowed, consider </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">improving their homes in the near future using the recommended measures in their report as a guide. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="23" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The difficulty in overcoming resistance in time-poor households is a perennial problem for many public policies that require the public to concentrate for a period of time in order to assimilate the message and change their behaviour accordingly. The offer of incentives appears to have had the ability to attract, or at least intrigue some residents and draw them into the next phase of the project. The 50% acceptance of home surveys provides some encouragement to strategists considering how to improve access for future programmes such as the Green Deal.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="24" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The trial in Timperley relied largely on offering all the rewards tested in the attitudinal work in 2009.

This followed the pattern of responses in the earlier surveys.

The results from the Timperley trial would appear to support this although work on a larger scale would need to be completed before this could be conclusively confirmed. More research is also needed in key areas to refine this conclusion such as norm-based effects of pro-environment community groups, different types of incentives, and overcoming other barriers such as insufficient time to reflect on the issue, and overcoming mistaken beliefs that individuals have already addressed their obligations to conserve energy. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="27" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The literature also confirms that policy-makers in the UK are beginning to consider the theories and methods that have been proposed by behavioural economists and social psychologists when designing strategies to influence public domestic action on energy conservation.

The Timperley Green Homes trial and the attitudinal work that underpinned it is one example of how some of this thinking can be applied to policy formation.
