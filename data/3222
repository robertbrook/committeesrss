Comment; - It is clear from evidence provided that the new complaint handling system is expected to deal with and streamline more complaints through to investigation (suggested level of around 6,000 complaints for this year). This is in excess of the previous levels when there were more investigators. Hence it is clear that once the 6,000 complaints are passed through to “commencement of investigation” then with less staff but more complaints then there will be a further “decimation “ on what-ever ground the investigators can use to disencumber themselves from complaints. Hence it is envisaged that more aggressive techniques and extension of the not inconsiderable discretion of the LGO will be used to get the complaints down to the point when only a couple of dozen cases will be actually investigated (see 2011/12 figures 25 reports finding mal-administration out of 96,000 contacts (0.038%)).</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">5.

It is my belief that in that event I would have exercised discretion in favour of the complainants because I believe in the particular circumstances of this case it would have been unreasonable to expect the complainants to have been required to resort to the remedy of judicial review. This is because I understood the complainants to be a group in </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">modest housing</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">, who would have been unlikely to have had the means to pursue that remedy from their own resources, particularly having regard to the uncertainty of the remedy; it seems to me that it is by no means certain that judicial would be appropriate for mal-administration where it related to a breach of the Code of Conduct. Further I would have particularly had in mind that it would have been very </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">difficult, if not impossible, for the complainants to obtain the necessary evidence to support such an application. Much of the evidence upon which I relied in my report was not available in documentary form, but emerged during interviews with the members concerned.

In my judgment this was a clear case for the application of the proviso. Serious allegations of mal-administration had been made. Such allegations could best be investigated by the resources and powers of the Commissioners, with her powers to compel both disclosure of documents, and the giving of assistance to the investigation. The Commissioner was in a position to get to the bottom of a prima facie case of mal-administration, and the ratepayers would be unlikely to have reached that goal, having regard to the weaknesses of the coercive fact finding potential of judicial review. As she found, it would be very difficult, if not impossible, for the complainants to obtain the necessary evidence in judicial review proceedings. Additionally, the complainants were a group in modest housing, unlikely to have the means to pursue the remedy. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">The Commissioner was clearly right to use the proviso to continue with her investigation</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">. This case is a good example of a case where the Commissioner's investigation and report can provide the just remedy when judicial review might fail to; and can reach facts, which might not emerge under the judicial review process.    </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><h1 style="margin:0pt; page-break-after:avoid"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">11.

We are initially told by the LGO that this section provides the LGO with the discretion to reject complaints since there is a potential legal remedy still open to the complainant to take against a Council.  We are further told and it is stated on the LGO’s website that section 82 of the Environmental Protection Act (EPA) is one such Act that the LGO considers is open to take action against the Council since the LGO states “</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">an application by a person aggrieved of a statutory nuisance (S7 of EPA for full list – </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">error -it is not S7 but rather S79).</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">The Council can be joined in proceedings where action is taken against a neighbour</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">“</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">.

The historical introduction of section 82 can be traced through </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Hansard</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> and other documents produced at the time but in essence this section was introduced for a variety of reasons the first being that people could easily take action against Councils </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">eg</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> Housing </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">departments where there were conditions that were considered to be a nuisance and problems had been encountered because Councils were unable to serve a nuisance abatement notice effectively on themselves. It was also seen as an alternative to action in the County Court or High Court for the matters listed as statutory nuisance for whatever reason the person did not want to ask the Council health department to investigate it under their powers to do so. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">20. An action can be instigated in the Magistrates Court quickly after giving notice to the person causing the nuisance. If the nuisance was established the Court would produce an </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">order</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> against the author of the nuisance.  S82 was never introduced as a mechanism to seek to review the performance of a Council’s action and its clear from the section there is no statutory framework to do so. There are rare occasions when a Council can be cited and this relates to sub-section 13 which allows action to be taken against the Council in circumstance where the author of the nuisance/ owner cannot be found.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">21. However it is clear from the above (S 82(4)) that the action in the Court is to be commenced against the </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">person responsible</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> for the nuisance. If that person is the Council then obviously action can be commenced against the Council. However the LGO has advised that the use of Section 82 is seen as an alternative remedy where the Council is not the author of the nuisance but rather a neighbour.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">We believe that this interpretation could be considered as an attempt to be able to use this as an excuse for not taking action against a Council who have not performed their statutory duty of investigation of a nuisance.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">22. Clearly for S82 the action is in nuisance against the person responsible for the matter in most cases a neighbour. The complaint to the LGO is in relation to injustice caused by the mal-administration of a Council. The Magistrates Court would rule on nuisance and if proven then it would issue an order. The Magistrates Court could not dispense a remedy against the Council for mal-administration that is the role of either the High Court (JR) or the LGO. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">23. However, if the LGO interpretation is correct then I am sure that any person with a mal-administration complaint against the Council in relation to statutory nuisance would be delighted to seek to a “judicial review” of the Council in the Magistrates Court rather than in the High Court or seek to involve the LGO. If this was the case then all statutory nuisance complaints about the service provision of Council could be redirected and therefore should other legislation be introduced for all other areas of the LGO work so that people have the same right of redress to the Magistrates Court and hence there would be little requirement for the LGO? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">24. Recommendation</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Section 82 should not be cited on the LGO web site nor should it be expressed by investigators as a mechanism of alternative legal remedy (S 26(6)(c) in relation to neighbour nuisances and hence must not be used as a reason for dropping the complaint against a Council. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">25. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Use of section 24(A) LGA74 – Wide discretion of LGO</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">We further asked the question of the LGO; if taking action in nuisance against our neighbour would cause our complaint with the LGO to be discontinued and the use of S82, we were advised as follows</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:ArialMT; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">“The 26(6) (c) remedy would not apply if you took action against your </span><span style="font-family:ArialMT; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">neighbour</span><span style="font-family:ArialMT; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">. This is because 26(6)c only applies if people take action against the Council. However, the Ombudsman has wide-ranging discretion and may decide not to start an investigation or to </span><span style="font-family:ArialMT; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">discontinue an investigation. One reason why she may decide to discontinue an investigation is where someone takes legal action against someone else.

If that is the case then such wide ranging discretion should be better defined since it would seem bizarre that action to prevent nuisance against another person, not the Council, would cause a discontinuance of the LGO’s mal administration investigation. It seems odd that parliament would seek to define when such powers can be used </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">ie</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> S26 and then provide such a wide ranging discretion that “trumps” everything else  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">It is interesting that slightly different advice starts to emerge once pressed.
