Therefore it would be logical for them to play a starring role in this now self evident battle against public disengagement with politics. This point is strengthened by academics such as Brazier and Fox, who comment that whilst the public do not trust politicians, they do in fact respond well to the style taken by select committees.</span><a name="_ftnref6"></a><a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> It is often argued however that committees do a lot of engagement already. It could be claimed that industry bodies are submitting evidence to committees, representing members of the public. Committees have websites that mean anyone and everyone can access, and engage with committee work. Perhaps the most infamous defence of committees engaging with the general public is: “but we have twitter”. Aileen Walker, the Director of Public Engagement for Parliament supports this view in ‘A People’s Parliament?’ noting how “again technology has added interaction between parliament and the public...twitter </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">youtube</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">, </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">flickr</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">”.</span><a name="_ftnref7"></a><a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> Perhaps select committees therefore are doing enough to bridge that gulf between governors and governed.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="7" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">I believe this assessment is both overly simplistic, and damaging to Parliament. Whilst it is valuable to do these forms of public engagement, their importance should not be overstated. These are, in my view, very superficial forms of public engagement. It is the head of AQA, not the ordinary teacher who goes up and gives evidence to the Education Select Committee. It is the banker, or the head of the multi-national who talk to the BIS Select Committee, not the small business owner. Moreover, if the parliamentary website was so effective, would more people not actively use it, and submit their own evidence? I am a student of British politics, and I did not know how to access committee’s inquiry </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">webpages</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">, let alone how to submit evidence to them. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="8" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Most galling of all however, the argument that having a twitter page automatically means that a committee is actively engaging with the public. This is most certainly not true. Predominantly twitter profiles of committees are followed by politicians, journalists, and other politicos. The Westminster Village. The</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> numbers following them are pal</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">try: Scotland (430), Foreign Affairs (520), BIS (630), International Development (650), Environment and </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Rural Affairs (650), Work and Pensions (650), Defence (900), Health (950), Communities and Local Government (1000), Science and Technology (1400),</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Justice (1600), Transport (1700), Home Affairs (2600), Education (3000).

I believe there are two ways in which this can be achieved. (Firstly) by asking ordinary people to submit evidence to committees, not waiting for them to, by chance, find an inquiry request within the bowels of the parliamentary website. (Secondly) by physically holding a limited number of evidence sessions outside of Westminster, around the country. Both of these points resonate with one core criticism of committee public engagement at present: it is about interacting and having a dialogue with the public, not simply disseminating a message. Engagement is something to be done ‘with’ not ‘to’ the public.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="10" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The first way to engage with the public is to get them involved with committees. To not simply rely on those who ‘understand’ the way the Westminster system works to get their voices heard. This point is perhaps best illustrated by using real life case studies. Did the Work and Pensions committee ask parents to submit their views when they launched their inquiry into child maintenance reforms in 2011? Did the Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs committee ask those who had been flooded out of their homes in the floods of 2007, to contribute their knowledge to the 2009 flood and water management bill inquiry? The answer to both is no. This is indicative of committees, and whilst it could be retorted by some chairs that they do in fact get statements from the public, this is very much a minority activity. It should be the job of the committees to make it as simple as possible for the public to submit evidence. Most members of the public, with serious firsthand knowledge of the policies committee inquiries are scrutinizing, are left completely out of the process at present. Politics is being done ‘to’ them, not ‘with’ them. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="11" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">How in that case can committees improve their active engagement with the public? What practical and easily implementable initiatives could be introduced? Simply relying on twitter and other social media is not an option. The numbers following committee profiles are miniscule. Arguably, direct engagement of another kind is what is needed first, and twitter followers will come afterwards. Taking out advertisements in the local and national newspapers is perhaps one way to reach a large audience. Making a simple pitch, we want you to be involved in the scrutiny process, we want the opinions of those who are affected to be reflected in our committees report.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="12" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> If that is too costly for committees to regularly do, given the number of committees, perhaps committee chairs should do a start of year press conference or interview to set out what inquiries will be taking place. They could then spell out clearly who they want input from, and how easy it is to do it. Not simply a press release, buried and ignored, or a post on a website, viewed by few outside of the political world. Engagement does not have to be </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">expensive, or time consuming, and the dividends reaped, both to benefit the scrutiny process, and equally as important, to bridge the growing gulf between governor and governed, is significant.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="13" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The second way in which committees can improve public engagement with politics is by holding evidence sessions outside of Westminster. Westminster is the loci of political power in Britain, but both psychologically, and architecturally, it is an imposing, elitist building. Ordinary people don’t feel they ‘belong’ or indeed, understand the workings of parliament. Therefore there is an argument to be made that by holding something as simple as an evidence session in parliament, a committee unwittingly is alienating many potential respondents from making a valuable contribution. As Walters and Rogers argue, “visits make a select committee inquiry more accessible; not only do they bring the committee to a local community, but they also mean that people can talk informally to MPs rather than give evidence in the often daunting surroundings of Westminster”.</span><a name="_ftnref8"></a><a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="14" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Nevertheless, it could be shot back, and legitimately so, that to undertake all evidence sessions outside of Westminster would (A) be unfeasible (B) be a waste of tax payers money (C) a waste of the limited time MPs have. However, to argue that some evidence sessions should take place away from Westminster is not the same as saying all should be. These points should not be conflated. I believe a new norm should emerge within select committees. Every committee should undertake a minimum of one session in other parts of the country, per year. This could be visiting local schools in East Yorkshire to gather firsthand knowledge about the introduction of the English Baccalaureate. This could be holding a town hall style meeting with residents affected by flood damage, and asking for their experiences of the government response in order to learn from past mistakes. This could take many forms, but the central theme would be actively engaging with the public. Sending a signal that select committees, and by virtue, Parliament, value the opinions of members of the public. Whilst this may seem like a paltry number of public engagements, in reality all 37 committees taking one day, or half a day to go to another part of the country to listen and interact with local people, translates into 185 public engagements throughout the course of a Parliament. This is not a paltry amount. This is significant, and most importantly, doable. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Conclusions</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="15" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">This submission has sought to do three things.
