One is called MetStats, and the other MetMIS. Both collect their data from other systems or databases, such as CRIS (the sys</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">tem into which crime reports are entered). Despite collating from the same databases, both MetStats and MetMis are updated with new data at different intervals, subsequently running the same search on each can produce varied results. MetMis was, so I was t</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">old by senior analysts, the system used to produce data for the Home Office and subsequently produces data compliant with the counting rules (HOCR).

Also issued was guidance on recording crimes where third parties from agencies made reports of crime on behalf of vulnerable third parties. In August 2011 th</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">e FCR issued advice concerning the failure to record Robbery in the absence of an IMEI number if it was a phone that was stolen. The FCR advice highlighted that this was not a valid reason for not recording crime. It is clear that the FCR was well versed i</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">n the issues affecting the Met. It is also noteworthy that, considering the size of the MPS, FCR advisory notes available to all staff on the force intranet can be counted on both hands; this appears out of kilter.</span></p><p style="line-height:12pt; margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="line-height:12pt; margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">3.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> Largely in recognition of problems in</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> crime recording in the Met, and the management of it, the CMU departments were centralised and renamed as CRIB, incorporating crime management and telephone investigations.

The same briefing also gave staff direction on applying the '72 hour rule', which I will return to later in the evidence. Both of these inclusions in the CRIB staff briefing are part of a wider problem.</span></p><p style="line-height:12pt; margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="line-height:12pt; margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">4.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> It has long been established, through the C</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">ourt of Appeal in </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">R v Clouden [1987],</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> that force can actually be applied to property in Robbery offences.

Subsequently management pressure from the top of the Met to Borough Commanders was translated into local pressure </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">from Borough Commanders to their own management teams, and then down through the ranks. This resulted in up to thirty-two (32) different responses to the pressure, including variations in 'gaming' or perverse actions. Local CMU's were just as susceptible t</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">o the local pressures as any other unit. The variations, doubtlessly, made the extent of the impact and scale of the problem very difficult to detect. With the launch of CRIB and the centralisation of crime management things have become more controlled, bu</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">t it also makes the scale of what was – and still is – happening easier to see.

It is here, with CRIB fully operational that the true scale of the issue is seen clearly. Theft from Person offences were found under-recorded in 2298 cases and robberies in 1845 cases. This also coincid</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">es with a further reduction in the detection rate for Robbery, while the overall detection rate also falls.

The significant drop in recorded</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> offences, both at initial and confirmed stages, is a concern, in particular as London now bucks the developing national trend of increasing crime. The concern is bolstered because the other behaviours shown in the statistics (e.g. under-recording and dete</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">ctions) suggest that very little has changed at all. I would be personally concerned that the developing 'gaming' or perverse behaviour is not recording crime in the first place.</span></p><p style="line-height:12pt; margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="line-height:12pt; margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">9.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> It is necessary to highlight the '72 hour rule' at this point.

That up until 2012, prior to the full establishment of CRIB, cri</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">mes in the three categories were almost certainly 'dropped off the books' inappropriately, after initial recording, at a rate of at least approximately 277 offences per month, or 832 per quarter, or 3,329 offences per year. In the period 2009 to 2011 this </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">equates to 9,988 victims of offences in these categories not receiving the quality of policing they deserve.</span></p><p style="line-height:12pt; margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="line-height:12pt; margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">10f)</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">. Referring to the previously raised issue of suspiciously similar, respective increases and decreases in Robbery and Theft From Person offenc</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">es, found in June 2013, there are potentially a further 273 offences of Robbery per month (8 per Borough) which are being under-recorded by category 'gaming'. </span></p><p style="line-height:12pt; margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="line-height:12pt; margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">11.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> The volume, longevity, consistency and continuance of the issues, even in the face of FCR a</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">nd Management Board interventions, is clear in the statistics, as is the fact that CRIB has helped expose the scale of the issue but not resolved it. It is clear that the explanation of 'mistake' or 'error' does not ring true. There is a compelling link be</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">tween management pressure and under-recording behaviour, including in response to MOPAC7 targets, however well intentioned they may </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">be. Knowledge is long held at the highest levels, as made clear by Lord Stevens, that police 'figures are fiddled' and none </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">of this is a surprise. It is also clear that the resolution truly lies where it begins: in  the senior ranks. </span></p><p style="line-height:12pt; margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="line-height:12pt; margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">12.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> Once again, </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">I thank the Committee for their time in reading and their consideration of this written evidence, and I also welcome any questio</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">ns that the Committee may wish to ask.
