A lack of development and service delivery may be one cause of dissatisfaction that motivates violence, but the roots of these and many other similar subnational conflicts typically lie more in resentment among local elites and the wider population at how the central state operates.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="5" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.17pt; padding-left:3.83pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">This has implications for foreign aid, which has a fairly poor record of addressing problems in subnational conflict areas and tends by default to work with recipient governments. Incentives to maintain good relationships with the national government, and the way in which aid programmes are inevitably shaped by dominant political trends, mean that minorities and local leaders are commonly ignored. Specific steps are needed to address their concerns and to involve them in planning and implementation. Economic initiatives including natural resource extraction, plantations, and dams have already contributed to violence across Burma’s border regions. Accelerated development is likely to exacerbate existing tensions. </span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.17pt; padding-left:3.83pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Aid agencies need to be particularly cautious over large projects that are likely to benefit state and associated business interests or unaccountable local elites. The promotion of small-scale local grants by the World Bank and others makes sense in this context, although aid can still be captured by vested interests at the community level. Other donors that are less bound by an apolitical remit may be able to engage more deeply in </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">the dynamics of development in border areas, assuming that they have strong political understanding of the potential outcomes. Bland and uncontroversial justifications claiming that aid initiatives will ‘increase confidence’, ‘build trust’, or otherwise ‘promote peace’ in conflict-affected areas need to be questioned. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Recent Changes</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="7" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.17pt; padding-left:3.83pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Despite continued uncertainty, Burma’s recent transition is now generating significant political, economic and social change. After decades of rule by an opaque and chiefly self-interested military junta, some political space is opening up and media censorship is being relaxed. Economic and development policies have continued to shift, with signals emerging that the leadership is more responsive to the needs of Burma’s ethnically varied and predominantly poor population of around 55 million. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="8" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.17pt; padding-left:3.83pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Burma’s transition may be genuine enough, yet it remains partial. The military has officially withdrawn from direct executive authority, but is still hugely powerful. It is not yet clear whether genuine opposition parties will be able to stand freely in national, as well as local, elections. Some political dissidents languish in jail or overseas. A small number of powerful businessmen with close links to the military, as well as military-owned companies themselves, still control vast swathes of the economy. Outlying regions are still affected by a string of conflicts, resource disputes and discriminatory practices, with violence in Rakhine and Kachin States indicative of deep-seated problems that will take many years to resolve. Active and forthcoming ceasefire agreements with rebel groups in minority areas demonstrate progress, but remain fragile. Reactionary anti-Indian and anti-Muslim currents within mainstream Burmese society led to widespread violence and arson in early 2013, another indicator of the different layers of tensions that are likely to endure. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="9" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 14.17pt; padding-left:3.83pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Changes in Burma have not directly resulted from a popular uprising or from any other single factor. Instead, a combination of considerations including the military’s continuing inability to quell a resilient opposition, concerns over the growing influence of China, and a desire to benefit from growing regional economic opportunities appear to have encouraged leaders to pursue a more conciliatory political path. 2014-2015 could see further significant change, with proposed parliamentary elections following the end of Burma’s turn to chair the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a position it has been unable to fulfill in the past given domestic unrest and international sanctions. Aung San Suu Kyi looks likely to stand for high political office, and has adopted increasingly conciliatory positions in recognition of the still-critical political role of the Armed Forces. </span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Wider experience of political transformations in Southeast Asia suggests that Burma is unlikely to follow a smooth track towards western-style liberal democracy and open markets. More likely scenarios involve a complex mix of elections and authoritarianism, with a diminished yet still significant political role for the military, and considerable power being wielded by well-connected individuals or networks of aligned interests. Improved economic and development outcomes should improve the lives of millions of Burma’s citizens as new space emerges for civil society. At the same time, unaccountable links </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">between well-connected businessmen and senior officials in opaque government institutions are likely to persist, as will tensions between the state and minority groups. </span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The military have sought to maintain their power, and will continue to do so. Reserved quotas of parliamentary seats should guarantee them an influential formal role even if the main opposition party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), were to win a national election - as seems likely under any free and fair poll. The military also wield considerable informal authority nationally and locally. The NLD itself incorporates a range of interests, with some influential older members regarded as intransigent and outdated. Relations between the NLD and Burma’s minority populations are complex. The limited concern shown by Aung San Syu Kyi for persecuted Muslim Rohingya in Rakhine state demonstrates deeply embedded ethnic tensions. A desire to court popular appeal and build good relations with senior powerbrokers is probably encouraging her to follow a conservative line.</span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 22.5pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Economic changes since the 1990s have increased both overall affluence and local disparities. It is estimated that nearly one in four farming families are landless. While increased investment in agriculture is generally a welcome sign of progress, many problems have emerged at the local level. Land tenure is poorly managed in many areas and prone to manipulation by powerful interests. Burma’s forest areas and other natural environments with high levels of biodiversity are insufficiently protected. New economic opportunities tend to be shaped by prevailing power dynamics. Senior leaders maintain a legacy of extracting resources by offering monopolistic opportunities to business allies and establishing patronage networks. Wealthy businessmen, like Tay Za and the associated Htoo group of companies, are linked with senior military figures. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Democracy and Governance </span></p><ol start="13" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Historically, checks and balances on power have been largely absent, with an expectation of governance through force rather than negotiation or democratic process. In many senses, military leaders assumed the mantle of pre-colonial traditional rulers, maintaining central authority through power, ideology and control of resources. There was little incentive for leaders to find ways to improve the lives of most ordinary people, resulting in low investment in health, education, or even infrastructure. Unlike rapidly developing Southeast Asian and East Asian nation states, leaders did not appear to perceive a need to compete with neighbouring countries by pursuing economic development targets, instead basing their authority on a mythical traditional desire to be independent and ethnically pure. </span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The military maintains high levels of influence and was able to capture a large proportion of the increased revenue flows generated as the economy partially liberalised. The number of military personnel more than doubled between the late 1980s and 2000 to over 400,000 in the army alone. It remains likely that many senior military figures will not oppose democratic reforms only so long as their personal and institutional interests are protected. They are likely to seek a deal that enables Burma to adopt some democratic processes while protecting budgets, business opportunities, and a continued political role for the military both in national politics and in regions with ongoing conflict concerns. </span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Across Burma, the government is widely seen as primarily exploitative. Opportunities to gain revenue are sought at many levels, formally and informally. The level of government revenue as a proportion of GDP is around 13%, in line with similar countries in the region. However, formal tax revenue is very low at just 3%, with civil and military government resources often coming from concessions and business opportunities. This situation generates incentives for civil and military leaders to pursue further rent seeking opportunities rather than to improve overall national economic performance through broader business development. </span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Outside government institutions, community-level responses have flourished in recent years and have often been tolerated by the state. The growing number of civil society organisations has been well documented. Civil society and community bodies typically follow a broadly apolitical mandate, offering developmental and humanitarian support, although many informally align themselves with the NLD or other opposition parties.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Subnational Conflict, Poverty and Ethnic Minorities </span></p><ol start="17" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Finding a sustainable and just end to the conflicts in Burma’s peripheral border areas is perhaps the country’s greatest challenge.

Tensions leading to regular outbreaks of violence have persisted since independence in 1948. Well-documented extensive human rights abuses and repeated displacement have further deprived millions of already impoverished people. </span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Although the Burmese military’s pursuit of ceasefire agreements gradually reduced levels of armed conflict in many minority areas, ongoing violence has continued. Many ethnic minority areas remain among the poorest in the country, with limited service provision and high levels of both malnutrition and communicable diseases. </span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">In Burma’s border areas, military officials and affiliated local leaders have typically extracted benefit from whatever resources are available: forced labour, land, mines and forests. Rebel groups have often been similarly exploitative. Government development initiatives in many border areas are based around accessing resources or pacifying the population through measures including resettlement and road construction. There is little extension of the state for any other purpose. In such a situation, unequal access to the benefits of state projects and economic development initiatives can feed resentment, enabling local leaders and entrepreneurs to mobilise people along ethnic lines. Service provision can also fuel conflict, state education sometimes being seen as enforced assimilation, for example. </span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The level of political interest in longer-term solutions to tackle underlying problems of contested authority is not yet clear. The ceasefire agreements reached to date are best seen as military accords between leaders of armed combatants rather than full peace agreements. Hopeful signs have emerged, including promises by President Thein Sein for inclusive political dialogue and the pursuit of peace talks over the remaining conflicts. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The establishment of decentralised political authorities for each of Burma’s fourteen states and regions is a further step. </span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">In addition to tactical steps to find ways round ‘spoilers’ – resilient military or rebel leaders who do not agree with or have little to gain from a successful peace process – it will be necessary to reduce the influence of the military centrally and at the local level. Broader public debate and consultation, as well as more meaningful local political mechanisms may be valuable tools. It will also be essential to provide alternative political channels for former rebels to pursue their interests and to satisfy at least some popular demands among minority groups. </span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">More fundamentally still, discussion of a new inter-ethnic accord in Burma is meaningless without recognising the deep-seated reasons why conflict has been so protracted, and pursuing appropriate measures in response. Long-term promotion by Burma’s leaders of an ethnically defined national identity sits uneasily with the country’s diverse population, over 30% of whom belong to minorities. A notion of shared civic rather than ethnically defined nationalism remains weak.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Exclusive ethnic nationalism: The roots of recent violence in Rakhine State </span></p><ol start="24" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:5pt 0pt 12pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">As is the case across much of the rest of Southeast and East Asia, cultural nation-building promoted in Burma by the military for decades is founded around racially defined categories. This has fostered an assumed superiority among the majority over minority groups (non-Buddhists in particularly), who are uneasily defined as being members of seven minority ‘races’. </span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:5pt 0pt 12pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">In 2012 inter-group ethnic trouble in western Rakhine state was followed by concerted campaigns of arson and aggression designed to drive members of the Muslim ‘Rohingya’ minority out of Burma. Rohingya are a marginalised and largely ignored group, who number about 800,000. They are effectively denied citizenship even if born in the country. The 2012 violence included perpetrators on both sides, but the main trend conformed to a long-term pattern of state-sanctioned discrimination and violent attacks against Rohingya. </span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:5pt 0pt 12pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Normally called Bengalis by the government and by most others in Burma, most Rohingya have lived in Burma for generations despite sharing much cultural affinity with their neighbours in what is now Bangladesh. Rohingya are described in mass media and common discourse across Burma as illegal migrants. </span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Discrimination and ethnic violence against all people of South Asian ethnic origin has been a common recurring theme in Burma since before independence in 1947. A 1982 citizenship law effectively disenfranchised many Indians remaining in Burma. Anti-Muslim riots scarred central Burmese cities in 1997, in 2001 and again in March 2013. Government security forces stood by as attacks took place. Indians and Muslims in general are still commonly perceived as a threat to the Burma nation, not only by hardliners, but also among the general public, Buddhist monks, opposition politicians, and even human rights campaigners.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">October 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
