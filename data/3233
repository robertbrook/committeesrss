If the application is approved and there </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">is residual environmental impact that cannot be mitigated in any other way</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">, </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">only </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">then should an off-set be discussed and agreed with a competent body.

In practice much of this work is likely to be dealt with by the planning departments, which are largely driven by concerns about concrete and tarmac, and hereabouts appear to rank higher in the scheme of things than overloaded biodiversity staff  in the weighting of decisions. If the actors remain largely as in current planning applications, then the developers are probably going to pay ‘ecological consultants’ as intermediaries to come up with an offset proposal. We have not been impressed by the quality of recent consultant’s reports relating to developments in our area, which are often formulaic and cover only a brief snap-shot in time of a particular site. It has to be remembered that they are in the pay of ‘developers’, but their reports seem to be accepted all too readily by Council Officers who lack the time or knowledge to counter errors, omissions and patently unrealistic promises as to mitigation outcomes.  Options that may suit commercial clients but not wildlife, and that conveniently fail to point out or adhere to what is best practice in respect of translocations, have sailed by without challenge from within the Council. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">7) </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Page 14 of the green paper states that ‘It has been suggested the pilot metric can be applied to a site in as little as 20 minutes.’ This may be true of a very small site that was recently a tennis court or </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">somesuch</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">, but otherwise we find this a cavalier statement that belies the </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Government’s real attitude to biodiversity, and is ignorant of the fact that even small unpromising-looking sites can turn up ‘interesting’ species if properly studied on a year-round basis.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">8) Will the Government provide the necessary finance to LAs to do the job properly, and if they do, will this not simply be funding yet another scheme that is actually about further retrenchment of wildlife - at a time when LAs like ours lack the funding to do much pro-active work to meet the objective (e.g. Bexley’s Parks and Open Spaces strategy) of actually increasing biodiversity in their areas?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">9) When assessing development applications, we believe that there is inadequate emphasis on the potential of supposedly ‘low value’ threatened sites to restore ground-level habitat linkage, and to harbour more and rarer species than they do now with suitable management, or by just being left to do their own thing. We note that in a planning system already heavily biased towards the concrete and tarmac merchants, with no third party right of appeal, the ‘worth’ of open spaces is effectively judged on the basis of what is there now, rather than what could be. On the other hand, planning applications are often approved on the basis of all sorts of essentially speculative claims about the future benefits in terms of jobs and money rather than what exists at the moment. This needs rectifying. In the off-setting context the ‘corridor’ and ‘potential’ factors should be built into an off-setting metric in some way.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">10) Any scheme which requires a ‘market’ of traded off-set sites is likely to favour organisations or individuals with money, and any conservation groups they might bring in to do the managing will be beholden to them and less likely to object to further off-setting schemes. Indeed you are creating a financial ‘pull’ for destroying sites as well as a ‘push’ from development proposals. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">11) ‘Development’ target sites and potential ‘off-set’ land values are likely to be higher if located within urban areas, which may price out conservation groups from controlling such sites themselves, and lead to towns and cities being cleared of wildlife land, including ‘higher quality’ sites, despite the nominal increase in theoretical offset costs for attempts at creating ‘equivalent’ habitat elsewhere. This could further estrange large numbers of people from a connection with nature, so that there is less political pressure to protect it further down the line.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">12) The proposals risk creating tensions between nature conservation organisations, with some wanting to protect Site A and others preferring to abandon it, take the off-set monies and run to improve Site B, which they happen to manage. This may be convenient for Councils and the Government, but not wildlife.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">13</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">) A starting point in determining what sort of sites should be protected ‘as of right’, a</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">nd not be subject to off-settin</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">g, would be SINCs. Whilst there are objective criteria, nevertheless there appears to be a tendency for Councils closer to central London to designate sites that would not be selected further out. That would go some way to overcoming the risk that inner cities get cleared of open wildlife land (point 10 above).</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> However, SINCS are not necessarily the only sites of biodiversity value ranking below SSSIs. In Bexley there are a number of allotment sites containing UK/London/Bexley BAP species, and some that would merit SINC designations were it not Council policy not to grant SINC status to allotments. By contrast, other London  Boroughs have designated a number of allotment sites as SINCs. This concerns us given Bexley’s recent performance on translocations, which has flown in the face of clear best practice guidance. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Biodioversity</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> ‘off-setting’ carries the risk of promulgating the message that translocations are fine as long as the developer claims they can’t retain species on site. The Council can then gain twice, first if every last corner of the site they own  is covered in buildings to maximise tax revenue and then gain again from payments for so-called ‘habitat improvements’ if it happens to own the site (say a SINC), to which it agrees animals should then be </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">translocated</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">, all the while claiming in public that it is doing a ‘good thing’ for biodiversity.      </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">14) We are extremely concerned about the scope for ‘mission creep‘, with various interests seeking to extend ‘off-setting’ to ever higher ‘value’ sites. We have already seen an example of </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">this in Medway, with an important Nightingale population.

They are clearly the result of an insidious and wide-scale gross over-consumption of resources, which is currently built into the heart of what is seen as ‘progress’. The goal of conventional ‘economics’ is, in fact, to liquidate ‘natural capital’ and non-renewable resources at an ever faster rate, and to build on ever more land, indefinitely. This is clearly not sustainable, and we should not be surprised that the result of this is major biodiversity loss and homogenisation of habitats and species assemblages. The conceits and temporary conscience-salving ‘fixes’ of ‘mitigation’ and ‘biodiversity off-setting’ are just that. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">17) The scientific reality is that </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">in June 2012 the world’s 105 science academies – including the Royal Society, the UK’s national academy of science </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">- </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">produced a statement highlighting the global challenges of population and consumption and calling upon world leaders to take decisive action. </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><a href="http://royalsociety.org/news/iap-population-consumption/"><span style="color:#356884; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; text-decoration:underline">http://royalsociety.org/news/iap-population-consumption/</span></a></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The Royal Society made it clear that ‘The </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">most developed and the emerging economies must stabilise and then reduce material consumption levels’ </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">to save the Earth from a "vortex of economic, socio-political and environmental ills".</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The Global Footprint network reckons the UK’s consumption is more than three times its </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">biocapacity</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><a href="http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/trends/united_kingdom/"><span style="color:#356884; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; text-decoration:underline">http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/trends/united_kingdom/</span></a></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The onus is clearly on the UK, as the sixth richest in the world, and grossly over-consuming, to significantly cut resource consumption. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">18) H</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">aving failed to halt biodiversity loss by the previously</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">agreed date of 2010, the UK Gov</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">ernment</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">, among many others, is now signed up to ‘the Aichi Targets’ set out in the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">2011–2020 under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><a href="http://www.cbd.int/doc/strategic-plan/2011-2020/Aichi-Targets-EN.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="color:#356884; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; text-decoration:underline">http://www.cbd.int/doc/strategic-plan/2011-2020/Aichi-Targets-EN.pdf</span></a></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Target 4: By 2020, at the latest, Governments, business and</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">stakeholders at all levels have taken steps to achieve or have</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">implemented plans for sustainable production and consumption</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">and have kept the impacts of use of natural resources well</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">within safe ecological limits.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">But t</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">he </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Government and official </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">‘</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">opposition</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">’</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> prefer to ignore this and carry on bleating about ‘economic recovery’ through a return to ‘growth’.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The priority should now be to repair the damage as best we can and not accelerate it further.
