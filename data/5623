The evidence we have received has always had a general tone: that things are not only going well—better than they are portrayed in the press in this country—but looking good for the future.  The tone has been optimistic, but there seems somehow to have been a shortage of empirical evidence to back up the optimism in the evidence we have been given.  Some people might say that tactical successes have been achieved by </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">the armed forces, and in some cases other Departments, but that the strategic success we have been hoping for is less secure.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">I suggest, therefore, that we are coming to the time for a straightforward historical analysis of what has happened—of what we have done well and what we have done badly—as recommended by this Committee in our report on the defence and security review to come. I begin by asking: is there an appetite in the Ministry of Defence for a historical discussion of what we have done well and what we have done badly?  That is your starter for 10.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lieutenant-General </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Everard</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> I have an opening statement, but perhaps I will return to it after responding to the question, if you are happy for me to do so; it might help frame some of our discussions.  In answer to the point about desire to learn lessons, let me say that I think there is a huge appetite to do that.  Through the doctrine centre and PJHQ we have amassed an enormous amount of evidence.  We used to call it “lessons learned,” but we recognised that on many occasions we were repeating the same mistakes, so we re-labelled it “lessons identified,” in recognition of the fact that there is a process for taking the data and genuinely learning from it.  Across defence, and certainly across the Army, there is a desire to do that, both in real time and in future.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Q3 Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Do you intend that process of identifying lessons to be made public?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lieutenant-General </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Everard</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> I would have thought that, because what we learn will be incorporated into our doctrine, which we share with many of our allies and partners, it would by necessity be made public.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Q4</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Gray:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> What you say about learning lessons is easily said, and would have been said by the military throughout all the generations.  It doesn’t actually mean anything.  Will you be doing a strategic-level assessment of how well we have done in Afghanistan, of whether the aims and ambitions were laid out properly and of whether they were achieved?  Will you be publishing that bit? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Vincent Devine:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> On the first question, there is a huge appetite within the Department, indeed across Government, to learn lessons from our operation in Afghanistan. That appetite has been there for at least three, four, or maybe five years, and there was a period of real self-examination, almost self-flagellation, around 2009 and 2010—quite rightly, as we concluded in capitals, not just in London, that we had not proceeded in the most optimal way in this operation. So there is a huge appetite for lessons to be drawn, at the tactical level, in procedural issues, and at the operational level. In due course, I am sure there will be a Government and departmental appetite from Ministers, officials and military officers for strategic lessons learned. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">You will understand that the extent to which we make those lessons public formally will be a matter for Ministers, but I could talk about some examples of areas where we are doing very thorough work to capture the lessons, to drive the changes that we have made in theatre into our doctrine and into our capabilities, and to ensure that things that we now do rather well in Afghanistan we can continue to do well in the future, so I think there is a genuine appetite.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Q5</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Gray:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> I hope that you won’t mind me saying that you would say that, wouldn’t you? Obviously, it would be a bit odd if you said: “We’re not going to pay any attention whatsoever to this and that.” That would be a very strange statement. Let me put it differently. Let me be very direct about it. A very senior serving officer, in a private conversation with me this week—he shall remain nameless for obvious reasons—said Afghanistan was a strategic catastrophe. Would you endorse that description?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Vincent Devine: </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Absolutely not, and I cannot think what position of authority he thinks he can make that statement from. Afghanistan is an ongoing operation in a military and political sense, so I absolutely refute that observation.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Q6</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Mr Devine, you said that you would be able to give some examples. Would you like to do that now?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Vincent Devine:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Yes. Without going into too much detail, one of the issues from which we have learned a great deal—I personally have spent a great deal of time on Afghanistan—is detention and exploitation of our opponents, the insurgents. We have learned a lot of issues at the policy level of what is the correct overall approach for the Government to take. Not least through our long-term engagement with the courts, I think we have developed a much greater understanding of the legal issues around detention.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">We have made some mistakes, not just in Afghanistan, but more pertinently in Iraq. We have learned from them. We have completely revised our procedures and our training, and that has all been written into doctrine. We have set up new structures to manage that, within both the armed forces and the Ministry of Defence. I co-chair a steering group that reports directly to the vice-chief and across Government. I work very closely with Neil’s people in the Foreign Office. We have also made some real technical advances. You may have had the opportunity to visit our forensics facilities or see our biometrics capabilities in action in theatre. All that has been developed and is being held for Afghanistan. We are now doing quite detailed work to ensure that the doctrine and the procedures are pushed into our SOPs, that we find a home in the armed forces for these capabilities—the biometrics and forensics—and that we continue to exercise the challenges of detention, just as we exercise the challenges of indirect fire or close air support.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">That is an area that I have spent a lot of time on. I think I can report to our Secretary of State with some confidence that we are capturing the lessons and, more importantly, implementing them. We need to be honest. The test will only come when we try to do this again, as to whether we have really captured and mainstreamed the lessons, but that is just one example that I have spent a lot of time on.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lieutenant-General </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Everard</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> If CJO were here, he would talk about the very good lessons—the capture process—that feed into the urgent operational requirements space and the changes in tactics, techniques and procedures that we use when deployed. One of the big challenges for the Army now, as it looks to reset for contingency, is looking at this massive capabilities that we have absorbed over the campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, and working out which of those are now going to come into our core structures and change the way we fight in the future. Our first brigade, 12 Brigade, completed a full training year last year, and absolutely the point of that process was this challenge. I think we learned huge lessons just in that one year, and I am sure we will continue to do that into the future.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Q7</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Mrs Moon:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> There are lots of different levels at which we need to learn lessons. As a country, we need to learn lessons for our armed forces, but we have also operated in alliance, as part of NATO and as part of the international security assistance force. Are we going to be looking at those different levels as well? What are the important messages and sharing that we need to do at that level? How can we improve co-operation and partnership, given that it is very clear that that is where we are going? Next time we are in a very serious operation, we are going to be in partnership, and that is the sort of partnership we are going to be in. How do we make sure that they work much more efficiently and effectively at that level, too?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lieutenant-General </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Everard</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> You are absolutely right. The fact is that collaboration and complementary activity is where we see ourselves going in the future, not just within NATO, but </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">perhaps in support of our slightly non-traditional partners like the AU. With our core defence alliance, NATO, the structures exist and work well. I understand that NATO will, as it normally always does at the end of a long campaign, conduct its own internal review to see how those can be improved. I am sure we will be part of that process. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Q8</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Ms Stuart:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> I may be doing an extraordinary injustice to you, but you look to me like three witnesses who, as the French would say, are not comfortable in their skin. So far, I hear about procedure, but I have not really learned anything. Just to aid me on how you will learn, tell me how open you will be with your colleagues in the Department for International Development as to what should not be done and what might be done again. How open will you be with your colleagues in NATO? I hope that you will not just say, “I trust that we will be part of it.” Am I really so misguided to think that you are to be one of the leading partners of this review within NATO? Just to keep me happy, tell me one thing that you would not do again, so that I can hold on to one thing that is not procedure. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lieutenant-General </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Everard</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Perhaps the reason we are uncomfortable is that in terms of what we deliver, we are delivering on the operational design and the planning theatre. What you are asking about at the moment are those high-level political negotiations and ministerial discussions that lead us to implement a plan. I feel slightly that I am out of my space in that area. In terms of your question, I would say that we have a mechanism in Whitehall within the MOD. I chair something called the Defence Crisis Management Organisation, which brings together all those partners we operate with, across Government, all the time, in a battle, which I think has led to better understanding and co-operation across Whitehall than people have seen for many years. The fact that we have so many nations that come to see us to understand how that process works, and indeed how the National Security Council process works, tells me that in terms of our coherence of understanding, we have a very good model. That has evolved over time from the lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan. Again, there is a huge focus on making sure that the NSC evolves to be better still. I think we have grasped that nettle of ensuring that cross-Government collaboration—working together—is a real priority. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Q9</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> What would you not do again in future?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Ms Stuart:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Just one thing you would not do again. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Vincent Devine:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> I am happy to answer that question.

Before this campaign started, in the days of the cold war, those activities were executed and called for at three-star level; now they happen almost at the point of contact on the ground. Companies are much bigger, much more capable and much more sophisticated organisations, and the doctrine has to be rewritten so that a company commander understands from his training how to operate with that, which has been done.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Coming back to Vincent’s point, a huge amount has gone on within the joint environment to ensure that people are better prepared, better set and better equipped to fight in the environment in which they have found themselves.

Speaking as someone who was a soldier back in the days when the world was black and white and we had muskets, I have not seen one lesson that has gone right the way through the Army, and certainly not from Afghanistan. The level of training and the expertise of our soldiers is now second to none. The incredible concentration on the individual soldier is now enormous, and I have never seen anything like that expertise and professionalism. In my day, we were in the stone age by comparison. That is one lesson that has come through. Forget about the command and control and forget about officers and NCOs; the individual man is quite outstanding, which is a result of operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lieutenant-General </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Everard</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Yes.

I think the evidence shows that actually, the NSF is nearly 35,000 strong in Regional Command Southwest—bigger than our NATO footprint ever was—and is operating hugely effectively. There are some figures I was going to quote in my opening statement: I find it interesting now that we absolutely rely on it to conduct operations—97% of all operations are planned and executed by it alone. It now leads on 90% of its own training. When you look at some of the complex operations it has conducted, including incorporation of air and air assault, this is our proficient machine that I think will hold the ring. In that end state, I think we have been successful. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Q15</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Holloway:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> So you do not think the South and East are going to go back to the Taliban over the next couple of years?

Having done quite a wide trawl, it gave a figure that 84% of people living in Helmand—clearly, it is a poll—believe that the country is moving in the right direction. I think there is a level of confidence there that perhaps we have not seen before. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">I was also interested to see the recent downturn in the number of security incidents that we are seeing year on year. If you compare 2013 to 2012, both the Afghan and the ISAF evidence show a 25% reduction in the number of security incidents. These are trends, and it is probably too early to read too much into it, but I think the fact that you now have Afghans in the lead in terms of security is changing the nature of the fight. In large part, not so many insurgents are prepared to engage in these sorts of operation. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">I come back to the point that I think we have created the space through the work of the provincial reconstruction team, pulling those strands for good government. I hope that Helmand will thrive, but I have a note of caution. You accuse us, quite rightly, of being over-optimistic, and that is clearly a fault. If you look at the history of Helmand province, in large parts of the rural area, there has probably never been a very strong Government presence. As the NSF chooses to focus its resources where it thinks it they will have the best effect, I am sure that means some areas will not have a presence that will maintain strong security. In that case, is that ground ceded to the Taliban, or will it revert to localism and go back to some of the tribal structures that have existed for years? I do not think it can be black and white, but I think we have created a space to give them a good opportunity. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Q16</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Yesterday, General </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Karimi</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> said that he thought the Afghan National Security Force would be able to maintain control, and that the Taliban would not come back into power.

In your answer, perhaps you could incorporate what you wanted to say in your opening statement. What is your assessment of how Afghanistan has gone in 2013, and what is your prediction and prophecy—not that you are necessarily a prophet—of how it is going to go in 2014?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lieutenant-General </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Everard</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> In that case, I will do a slightly tailored version of this, and then probably add a bit at the end. I recognise that you are asking for a brief assessment on the current security situation in Afghanistan and the challenges looking ahead to next year, recognising, as I hope everybody does, that the NATO combat mission comes to an end on 31 December, with NATO transitioning to a much smaller follow-on mission, Resolute Support, in which I hope the UK will play an important role. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">As you know, the 49 nations that contribute to the International Security Assistance Force mission went into Afghanistan to remove AQ and prevent the country from being used as a platform for attacks across the world, including against the UK and UK interests. Today, AQ has no safe haven in Afghanistan and the number of AQ fighters remains low. Across the country, compared with the same period last year, Afghan reporting shows a significant reduction of 12% in overall security incidents over fighting season 13, including a reduction of IED attacks of 22%. The full ISAF end of year record of enemy-initiated attacks comparing 2012 with 2013 shows a 25% reduction in Regional Command South-West where the UK is based. All that is positive.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Of course, in addition to extending Government authority across the country, a key ISAF military strategic campaign objective has been and is the development of the structures required to maintain security in Afghanistan without the assistance of international forces. Again, I would argue that with ISAF support the ANSF has made some striking progress. The surge strength of 352,000 all up—ANA, air force and police—has largely been achieved. Manning sits at 98% and the trend is up. Recruiting remains very solid. Since assuming the lead for security on 18 June, the ANSF has successfully contained the Taliban throughout the latter half of fighting season 13, and grown in operational effectiveness and confidence. I will just repeat the figures: 97% of all operations are planned and executed by ANSF and they now lead on 90% of their own training.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">It is that success that allowed us, in line with ISAF direction, to reduce numbers and shift quickly to a train, advise and assist role, which now includes a very focused effort this year to develop the institutions, systems and end-to-end processes necessary to sustain the ANSF ahead of full security transition. Indeed, the only unilateral UK operations that we now conduct are in support of our force protection, route clearance, sustainment and redeployment activity. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">You asked about the future. I think there are challenges and opportunities that need attention. I would list them as follows: ANSF attrition levels; ANSF reliance on ISAF and US enablers; and further ANSF development in planning, programming, budgeting, acquisition and the better management of human resources is a challenge. Secondly, although the Taliban are not an existential threat to the Afghan Government or the ANSF, and 87% of the population view them negatively, they remain a potent threat and capable of contesting Government control in some rural areas, mounting high-profile attacks in others or inspiring lethal insider attacks.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Another challenge is the election in April 2014. We must as a priority maximise every opportunity to help the Afghan Government and the ANSF to deliver a credible, inclusive election, noting to date that planning is going well and the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan has delivered 11 credible candidates, which again is positive.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Next, I mentioned redeployment. After considerable planning, we must now continue to deliver a complex redeployment plan, noting that so far the vehicles and major assemblies we have removed from theatre represent only 47% of the total number. Lastly, there is the transition to </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Resolute Support mission, where no decisions have been made on the final size of the UK footprint ahead of the bilateral security agreements and related status of forces agreement that will frame our freedoms and constraints.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">In summary, we know that some form of political settlement between the Afghan Government and the Taliban is needed and that there are challenges ahead. We have to be cautious and remain flexible and continue to balance the operational requirements with our redeployment imperatives and force protection. What I think is clear is that we have made responsible and sustainable progress in the development of the ANSF. Again, the evidence shows that in virtually all tactical engagements, with often limited ISAF support, the Taliban have been overmatched by the ANSF. With just over 34,000 ANSF now deployed in Regional Command South-West, they generally do have that strength in depth. Critically, the ANSF are well set to support the elections, which is a key step towards a democratic future for Afghanistan.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">In summary, looking back, there is evidence that the foundations are in place to give the Afghan Government what they need. Some of the trends would indicate that violence levels are coming down, and I think we are shaping up well for the elections and the period after that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> You talked about the tactical engagements where the ANSF were effective and successful.

It was the first year in which the Afghan National Security Forces were going to be in the lead across the country, and I think the collective Whitehall assessment, and indeed the collective assessment of our allies and everybody in the US system, including the intelligence community, which has historically been a bit more pessimistic than the UK military, has been that the Afghan National Security Forces have performed better than expected, and that is a very positive thing. They have held their own against the Taliban, and that generates a lot of confidence in the political community.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The security transition is one of the big themes for this year. The other big theme is the political transition. We have the presidential election in April, which will see a successor to President </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Karzai</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> elected. For us as diplomats, the collective Whitehall view was that it was very important that the elections took place on time. We thought it was important for Afghans to see that there was a plan that its political leaders were sticking to, and it was important for Afghans generally in terms of their political development to see that power can be transferred peacefully through the ballot box, which has not been a feature of Afghan history, or indeed in that part of the world generally.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">This time a year ago,  we were worried that the elections would be postponed for one reason or another. It was not clear that President </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Karzai</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> would stand down. People were worried that the security situation would preclude elections. What we have now is a situation in which elections are taking place on time. All the bits that you need to support a good election, such as election laws, are in place. There are two electoral commissions—one to oversee the elections and one to rule on violations—and I think international observers will be there.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">I do not want to give you the impression that this will be a west European election. It will be run according to the standards of the region, but there is a credible set of candidates. There is a real buzz in Afghanistan talking about the elections, and at this stage the result is wide open. I do not need to tell the people here that that is actually how elections are supposed to work. It has not always been a feature of life in south or central Asia, and in a sense that is a measure of success. There is a lot of optimism about the elections but, naturally enough, whenever there is a change of this sort, it creates uncertainty as well.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Q19</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Sir Bob Russell:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Would you like to clarify what you mean by the standards for the region in terms of elections?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Neil Crompton:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> If you look to the north, in central Asia there have not been many elections in recent years. If you look to the south, Pakistan held very important elections last year, but that was the first time in Pakistan’s history that a democratically elected Government had served its full term and transitioned to another democratically elected Government. On Afghanistan itself, its political history I expect you all know better than I do. I think this will be the first time an elected Afghan President will be handing on to another elected Afghan President peacefully. In the regional context this is not a first time, but it is a newish event. It is not the experience of everybody and I think that will set the tone for the election. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Q20</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Sir Bob Russell:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> So is the overview of the Foreign Office that the preparations for the forthcoming presidential elections are on schedule?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Neil Crompton:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Yes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Q21</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Sir Bob Russell:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> And no hiccups anticipated?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Neil Crompton:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Well, I think there could be—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Sir Bob Russell:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> I did say “anticipated”. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Neil Crompton:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> There are lots of things that we need to work on hard.

You then have the elections themselves. How long will that last? Will there be one vote, or will it be a run-off? It could extend through until June. When those elections are successfully completed, I do see in our own mind a mental shift to a change in priority, when our priority becomes consolidation of our force and we look ahead to the last stage of the redeployment and transition to whatever our Resolute Support mission becomes. I think the end of the elections is a key moment for us because it indicates a shift in direction. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Q23</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Sir Bob Russell:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> My final question to you, General </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Everard</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> is: will UK forces have any role in protecting polling stations during the elections? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lieutenant-General </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Everard</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Our role is, in extremis, to provide support to the Afghan security forces from the air and from the ground.

People defer to experience and age, so he may have a role in helping to shape difficult political or constitutional decisions in future—but I think he will be doing it from one or two steps removed.

The more I look at this, the more I think the timeline that was set on the end of combat operations in December 2014 and the trigger points on transfer of security to Afghan national security forces have acted as a forcing function which has changed the dynamic on the ground. I fear that if we had waited in larger numbers we would not have seen the progress that we have seen elsewhere.

There are probably some who still think they can march into Kabul—I think they are a minority. There are some who recognise realities—that they are not going to get back into Kabul or get back into power on their own terms—and have in a sense been putting out diplomatic feelers over the past two or three years. There have been various stillborn diplomatic initiatives, with the Taliban attending conferences in Japan and France and elsewhere. There was an attempt to establish a Taliban office in Doha last year, which would have acted as an official office for the Taliban political leadership. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">I think that debate still takes place within the Taliban. For those who believe that they have to come to some sort of political accommodation with the authorities in Kabul, two factors will come increasingly into play. First, the nature of their insurgency is changing. A year ago 80% of Taliban attacks were directed against international forces. I think you can reverse those figures now: 80% of Taliban attacks are directed against Afghan national forces. It is much harder to sustain the idea of a jihad when you are fighting Afghans than when you are fighting western—US and UK—forces. We believe that is a cause of concern to some of the Taliban leadership. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Secondly, the elections and the departure of President </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Karzai</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> also change the dynamic for them. Part of the Taliban narrative has always been that President </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Karzai</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> was a western stooge who was imposed at the Bonn conference, which they did not buy into. President </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Karzai</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> will depart in April and a totemic figure for them will have gone. The more thoughtful of the Taliban—those inclined to a political settlement—are thinking how to manage that challenge. Their political space and horizon are changing, but at what point a critical mass of the Taliban favours negotiations as opposed to military operations we don’t know. It will be the task of diplomats to try to accelerate that process.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Q29</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">John Woodcock:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Say they do, as a coherent group, favour negotiations, and say those negotiations are successful, can you give a necessarily very broad view on how realistic it is that that future state remains one in which the security danger to our country and others is lessened, making the overall intervention by the UK worthwhile? What kind of state would that look like? It would surely be quite different from the one we have today. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Neil Crompton:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> That is a big question. Perhaps President </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Karzai</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> articulates a widely held Afghan view when he says that the Taliban would be eligible to run for elected office, provided they accept the political process, such as it is, and they could hold any elected office that they can secure enough votes for. My guess is that they cannot secure the presidency, but they may be able to secure some local positions. The appointed positions in the Government would be divided, much as they are now, on the basis of the power understandings between the different political and ethnic groups within Afghanistan. The Taliban know that they will need to break their relationship with al-Qaeda. Their leadership understand that, and we believe that they have discussed that among themselves. They know that that is something they will have to do at some point if they are to have a place in the political process and if they want to enjoy the benefits of international support which would flow to other parts of the country where they would not be popular. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Q30</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">John Woodcock:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Those two last things you mentioned are clearly critically important.

We have seen evidence of them discussing among themselves the relationship with al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups in Afghanistan. It is a matter of public record now that they considered breaking with them before, but they didn’t. The other issue they know they will have to deal with is that they will need—for want of a better term—a more progressive position on women’s rights. It is not going to be a position that we would necessarily favour, but I think they know that they have to evolve if they are to remain relevant in a society that has changed greatly in the last 10 to 12 years. Those of us who </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">monitor it closely have seen evolutions in their position; so the formal Taliban position now is that girls have a right to education. The formal Taliban position now is that women have a right to work.

We visited Pakistan back in November, and that was the last time we went out to Afghanistan as well. We had a discussion with them. Their military has changed and is changing. They have their own Taliban-type problem. They are obviously hugely important in terms of settlement for the longer term. Is there anything you would like to say about where you believe the neighbours are in that process, including the other neighbours: China, India, because of its relations with Pakistan and its influence there, and also Iran?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Neil Crompton:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Sure. Just on reconciliation, I think what the governor told you is right. There are a number of processes running in parallel. At the highest level there is discussion among the Taliban leadership, largely based in Quetta, and some of their surrogate groups like the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Haqqani</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> group, about whether they can sustain the fight, whether they can win the fight or whether they should pursue their aims through political means. That debate is unresolved. Within the country itself a lot of local deals will be struck between people who are involved in the insurgency but do not necessarily take ideological instruction from Quetta. Local Afghan leaders and Afghan commanders and politicians will deal with these things in Afghan ways. We see some evidence of that already. Your conversation with the governor will have given you some insight into that. To outsiders this will look quite messy, but to Afghans it will look quite natural.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">In terms of the neighbours, I will start with Pakistan. One of the reasons I share everyone’s sense of optimism is that one of the positive things that has happened in the last two years has been an improvement in Pakistan-Afghan relations. That has taken place for a number of reasons. Pakistan always argued that for there to be a settlement or political stability in Afghanistan it needed to be inclusive, so it needed to involve the Taliban. That view wasn’t the international consensus until the Bonn conference in December 2011, when United States and ISAF nations explicitly backed that proposition. The Pakistanis began to see that there was a proposition that they could support, and at the same time, as you alluded to, their own security problems at home have intensified, so they have a terrible and deepening insurgency. Increasingly, the Pakistani army looks west—mostly it now cuts its teeth fighting the insurgency, rather than worrying about India. There has been a growing realisation, shared by both the security services and the civilian establishment in Pakistan, that you cannot resolve the insurgency in Pakistan without a greater degree of stability inside Afghanistan.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">What we have seen over the last year or two is a thickening dialogue between the Afghan and Pakistani Governments about how the peace process might advance. They are beginning now to discuss some quite specific steps which will allow the Afghans and Taliban to get talking. I think there is still a long way to go in that, and it is a relationship that has a lot of historical mistrust, but from where I sit, Pakistan’s overall position is a constructive and very important one as we go into 2014 and 2015.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">With the other neighbours, we find an unusual confluence of positions. As General </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Everard</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> said, the end-of-2014 deadline focused everybody’s minds in different ways. We are in an unusual situation now where countries as diverse as Russia, China, Pakistan, India and some of the central Asian states are all advising President </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Karzai</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> that he should sign a bilateral security agreement with the United States, because they would like the international presence to remain for a little longer. We see some evidence of countries such as China doing slightly more to help in the security field—for example, training Afghan police. They are also doing things that we want them to do, like trying to help Afghanistan develop its mining sector. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">I would put the Iranians broadly in that camp, as another country whose interest lies in stability in Afghanistan. We hope very much that the easing of tensions between Iran and the international community over nuclear fuel will have a beneficial knock-on effect and allow for a resumption of some of the co-operation we had ten years ago.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Q32</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Mr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Havard</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> And the Russians?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Neil Crompton:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> The Russians are in a similar place.

The American agreement is obviously the main thing. As you say, there would be no NATO mission without it. There are plans, however, for a NATO mission at the moment, and the UK will have bilateral discussions at some point. Presumably they will be roughly in that order. We have declared that we are going to train, but we have not said what else we might do. The NATO mission as I understand it, however, is to train, advise and assist—whatever that might mean. We saw ourselves the assistance that the Afghan forces might need—extra enablers and so on. That is one thing. I was told two years ago that there would be training, a continuing counter-terrorism mission and then it would be something that talked about supporting the fielded force—which are roughly the same elements as the NATO mission.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">I want to be very clear about this question of where the neighbours are and those relationships. You are talking about something that trains people and assists them to do their job. Alongside it, there is still going to be continuing counter-terrorism missions of some sort, either more in concert with the neighbours or not. That is going to be very difficult to talk about publicly—I appreciate that—but can we be clear about what the structure of the relative agreements is likely to look like? Something that just allows the Americans to have forces in the country is one thing, but there are other questions about what the missions will be able to do relative to one another.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lieutenant-General </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Everard</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> I think this is hugely difficult, because as I said in my opening statement, we believe that the freedom and constraints of the operation in a whole raft of areas will flow from the BSA and the related SOFA. As Vincent said, our planning assumption at the moment remains that it will be signed at some stage, and our options are planned around that. The NATO Secretary-General has laid out a vision for what he sees the resident support mission looking like. He has talked about a strong core in Kabul and a number of hubs and spokes out in the field to continue that support that you have talked about. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">I think we have to wait and see where this goes.

Whereas one could have complete faith in the ISAF product, clearly we are getting some of this slightly second hand, but I think the metrics show that the decrease in security incidents that we are seeing in RC South-West is pretty much replicated across the whole country, with the exception of RC East, which is still down, but is much less down. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">I come back to the Taliban. We know what their objectives were for fighting season 13 because they have now published them, but they fell well short of those and have been largely pushed out from the populated areas—hence the fact that a lot of the fighting takes place where not many of the people live. I also come back to the point that I think you see an ANSF that is growing in confidence.

In terms of our priorities, I think I set them out. At the moment, they are: train, advise and assist, and set the conditions for the elections in support of ANSF. That is going well. The planning is more detailed and thorough than we had expected at this stage, and that is good. At the same time—and underlining that train, advise and assist mission—we recognise our requirements to conduct a complicated redeployment force plan, which we continue to get on with, while ensuring that our force protection remains a priority. It is those three things of train, advise and assist—clearly, force protection underpins them—at the same time as we begin our redeployment.

I do not think that you would have found those sorts of events happening before we got there, but I think Neil is right when he talks about some people thinking that things have not changed and they can still march on Kabul.

I go to a lot of conferences where, thankfully, leading Afghan women figures turn up and stress the importance of continuing to support women’s international rights. There is a security dimension to this as well as a social dimension, but I do think the fact that Afghan society has so profoundly changed in the last 12 years gives us cause for hope. So many women and young girls have been educated since the international community became involved, and I hope that that will allow for enduring progress. One of the things that international donors have made clear to any Afghan Government is that the extent of international support will depend upon continued commitments in these areas—and a few other areas, of course.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Q43</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Gray:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Just briefly, to interrupt the middle of the conversation, if you like.

I started off with ANSF attrition. You have a force that is losing 32% of its strength every year. That is not good news, and we need to work very hard on that. You are seeing far too many people do what is called “drop from role”, going AWOL and staying away from their place of duty for more than 21 days than we would like. In all those cases we understand the nature of the problem. Any army wants a cycle of rest, training, operations. For a large part, the Afghans are just doing operations. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Q44</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Gray:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> But to interrupt rather rudely: the ANSF are not directly our responsibility. My question is whether the things that are our responsibility have gone wrong. You are right that the attrition in the ANSF is a bad thing and we will come back to that later in our evidence session. I am just puzzled by the notion. I am trying to imagine any circumstances in which people of your seniority would ever come before the Committee and admit that it has all been a foul-up.

I inherit a set of cards and we play them as skilfully as we can. Again, I look at the direction of travel we are going with and I am satisfied with our progress. I agree with Vincent: I wish we had started training security forces earlier for longer. I wish some of the high-end capabilities they rather lack we had brought into them sooner rather than later. There are things that we wish we had done better.

Everyone on this Committee thinks that the guys on the ground do a very brave and professional job, and most of us think that the outlook is a bit brighter than it was a couple of years ago, but do you really think, General, that the main lesson to be learned from Afghanistan is that we should have had more capabilities and technology at company level, that that was really what went wrong at the beginning? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lieutenant-General </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Everard</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> No. Last time we spoke I was the assistant chief of the general staff. The major lesson for defence is that our forces were poorly structured for the campaign that we were to commit them to. Have we learned strategic lessons?

I know that CDS used a quote in his recent speech that our greatest failure has been to try to change the world without understanding it first. That has been the big strategic lesson, that we were poorly prepared in structure for the challenge that we faced. We recognise that the SDSR has to come and will decide how much resource goes into this area. In terms of structure, our forces have reconfigured to take account of that lesson.

Could I ask you to go back a little bit to the structure for lessons learned? The doctrine centre comes up every so often. Who and where is that now? The biggest problem we have had over the years and nobody is responsible for their predecessor’s record. Who is now the custodian of lessons learned and where are they physically located? Who can we visit to say, “This is what we have learned from X, Y, Z and H. This is where we have stored the specific lessons from this campaign.

Many of its starting points are rooted in the lessons we have learned from Iraq and Afghanistan. Did they hold up a tome on the lessons we have specifically learned from there? No, but I would be surprised if they don’t have one. It might be something I have to come back to you on. I am sure that there will be a product at that level with military lessons to be learned.

The lead for counter-narcotics lies with the Home Office. The honest answer to your question is that we have not achieved everything we set out to do. We made a real and determined effort to try to deal with this problem which affects us in the UK. We probably made lots of mistakes along the way. We have learned along the way when dealing with problems like this that they are a multi-generational problem; it involves a comprehensive approach which includes everything from law enforcement in the streets of London through to capacity assistance in the Afghan Government. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The recent UN figures which show that opium production is rising in Afghanistan have been very disappointing.

It is a source of revenue to them. I think opinion is divided on how important it is as a source of revenue to them. Sometimes the idea that the Taliban are 90% dependent on opium production is overdone. The reality is that if they were not growing opium they would be taxing wheat production or some other crop. Clearly that is a cause of concern, but among the analytical community there is this debate about how significant a source of revenue it is for the Taliban.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Q48</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Mrs Moon:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> I have some tolerance for your saying it is a Home Office lead, but this Committee has also been looking at the attack on Camp Bastion. One of the most jaw-dropping facts that came out of that was that right up to the fence of the British base were poppy fields. They were being allowed to flourish because of water run-offs from the British base. How real has any attempt been on behalf of the UK to tackle poppy production when we can tolerate fields growing outside the fences of our bases?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Neil Crompton:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> I confess that I had not heard that story about poppy fields on the run-off around the base at Bastion.

CN grows in places where there is ungoverned space and the antidote is to improve the capacity of the Afghan Government and create jobs.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Moving on to the status of the ANSF, there may be a few questions still to ask about this.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Q58</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Brazier:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> I think we have pretty much covered it.

We expect to have a status of forces agreement that gives us jurisdiction over our own personnel when they are acting in the course of their operations. In my view, that is likely to be a red line for our Secretary of State, so the UK will retain jurisdiction over UK personnel in the NATO mission.

It is an interesting question, because I had not seen the breakdown of the ANSF model until quite recently, and it does lead to a number of other questions, which we have not yet got the answers to.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Q69</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Mr Devine, would you like to answer the question posed to you?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Vincent Devine:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> First of all, we do not dispute that the southern </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Pashtun</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> are underrepresented, particularly in the officer corps, and we are working on that. That is just a reality. I think your summary is reasonably fair, with the exception of the suggestion that there is a lack of honesty. I think there was a lack of understanding of the operation we were becoming involved in and the wider theatre of engagement. It is a matter of record that previous Governments and this Government have recognised that. I think we did fail to match our resources to the task. Again, that has been recognised publicly. Having done that—such errors happen—we failed to adapt rapidly enough as a Department to the kind of conflict we found ourselves in. We kept ploughing that furrow rather than stopping, thinking and resetting.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">I think also, as the Government has previously said, that we failed to fully identify or resource Afghanistan as the main effort probably until around 2008 or 2009 when it became the main effort not just in name, but in reality in terms of allocating resources and moving UORs through. The lessons we have learnt—I will not use the phrase mistakes that have been made—across the alliance in Afghanistan are pretty much a matter of consensus now. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">I take what members of this Committee have said about the optimism we are portraying about Afghanistan. Speaking personally, and having discussed this with a range of colleagues from across the alliance, I genuinely believe that we now have the best strategy available to us in Afghanistan, and we have seen the way in which that strategy has played out, particularly over last year. I re-read the transcript of the session with the Committee in December 2012. I think both people at this table and people around the Committee table at that point would have been pleasantly surprised at the way in which 2013 has indeed panned out—the extent to which we have pushed the NSF into the lead in theatre, in a way in which the Committee suggested in the report, and the way in which they have taken the strain and performed, frankly, probably beyond our expectations. I think the development of the NSF enablers which we talked about at great length last year has also pleasantly surprised us. They are making great progress on the medical front. They are improving the logistics. The Afghan air force has jumped forward in a way that one year ago we would probably not have predicted. I think it is just worth adding that caveat. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> A couple of other colleagues would like to come in.
