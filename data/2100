To what extent do the Government’s existing powers of direction over regulators already provide the ability to guide regulators towards the importance of promoting economic growth? Is this legislation necessary?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">This legislation is necessary. Too often, decisions are made or guidance issued by a regulator, without any consideration or thought for the economic consequences on the industry they are regulating. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Requiring regulators to have regard for promoting economic growth in the industry they regulate would mark a sea change in approach, and we welcome such legislation. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">It should lead to regulators pausing and thinking through the economic impact of any decision they make and should lead to a much better understanding about the issues – from both sides.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">18. Will the introduction of a duty to have </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">regard</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic"> to “promoting economic growth” compromise the independence of regulators? What additional safeguards are required to ensure that the introduction of such a duty will not compromise the independence of a regulator?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">There is no reason that we envisage where the independence of the regulator would be compromised under this duty. It simply means that the regulator should be expected to consider the economic impact of their decisions on the industry they regulate and ensure they consider how such a decision would promote economic growth – or might not.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">19. How is a duty to have regard to the desirability of economic growth likely to affect those regulators to which it is applied?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">We believe it would make the regulator more considerate of the economic impact of their announcements, proposals before publishing them.  It could allow for discussions beforehand </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">to iron</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> out any misunderstandings that could occur and prevent anything which has the capacity to turn a minor issue to a major one.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">While this could be seen as a new basis for a regulator to work, it simply flags up that the regulator has not been doing this beforehand. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">20. Where is the introduction of such a duty likely to have beneficial effect? Where might there be adverse consequences?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">It is likely to be of benefit in the ways decisions or announcements are made, hopefully leading to discussions before any announcement, and an understanding by the regulator of the costs to business of what they are proposing. The adverse consequences seem minimal – it could lead to disputes over how much something is impacting on business, and indeed business could overstate the impact of any decision or issuing of guidance. That is why a much closer working relationship would mitigate this from happening. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">21. How might the extent to which a regulator has fulfilled, or breached, the duty be ascertained?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">As part of publishing a new proposal for the industry, or asking for new information – or the same information in a different way – the regulator should provide details of what they think it will cost the industry – in staff time and money – to provide this information; in turn, when responding, the industry could provide the costs as incurred, so the facts are there. The proposals included the expectation that the regulator would publish a clear statement on how they would promote economic growth, and an annual report setting out how they had achieved it. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">This seems the best way to do this, providing a basis for how the regulator will promote economic growth, against which they can be measured, but would also mean the industry being regulated understood where the regulator was coming from. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">22. How can the likely financial and economic impact of the proposed duty be assessed? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Betting shop operators can calculate the costs (staff, time) involved in responding to requests or providing information to the Regulator – this would provide a clear statement as to whether a proposal or decision was promoting or impeding economic growth.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The ABB would be happy to provide oral evidence future to the Joint Committee.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">16 September 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
