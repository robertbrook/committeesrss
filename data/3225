For small businesses it is not about the monetary value, which we agree will probably be limited. By focusing health and safety regulation on those businesses and scenarios that pose greater risk and allowing self-employed, low-risk businesses to concentrate on other issues there is a time benefit to be gained. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="7" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.17pt; padding-left:3.83pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Furthermore there is a gain to be made by an increase in business confidence. Many small businesses worry that they are not complying correctly and may one day ‘be caught out’. By removing them from the obligation of health and safety regulation it will give them the confidence that they are not going to be inspected and possibly found to be non-compliant. No cost benefit can be placed on this gain.  </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="8" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.17pt; padding-left:3.83pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">There was a discussion about whether exemptions for micro businesses (fewer than ten employees) create a two-tier labour market leading to stunted growth. This is a policy debate which the FSB is engaged in, and has raised concerns about in regards to labour market regulations. However, in this instance this should not be a concern as the exemption is only focused on those that do not employ. The moment that they employ someone they will need to comply with health and safety regulation as they do now. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="9" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.17pt; padding-left:3.83pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">For small businesses the quality of the HSE guidance about these changes will be crucial to the success or otherwise of these changes.

They need to interact with businesses that wish to be compliant in a helpful, constructive and proportionate way.
