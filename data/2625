The most useful ‘parental control’ is parental responsibility and, inseparable from this, the commitment to developing their children’s own sense of responsibility as they grow up.</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> It is imperative that children and young people are encouraged to take appropriate responsibility for themselves and their own behaviour increasingly, so as they grow up but beginning in small ways at an early age. In this way, while parents and other adults will still be highly involved, children can be supported to grow up with the idea of responsibility as something integral to, rather than entirely outside of, themselves. Our peer mentoring system works on the premise that children and young people can and do rise to the challenge of appropriate responsibility, properly supported at every stage by older peers and trained adults. Of course online safety cannot be the responsibility of children in isolation, but neither can it be the responsibility of parents alone. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">3.4</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Over half (57%) of the 11 – 18 year old respondents surveyed in 2012</span><a name="_ftnref3"></a><a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> told us their parents talk to them about online safety and what they should or should not look at on the internet as a way to keep them safe online. As the largest category of response this indicates that among our respondents a majority of parents are actively engaged in their children’s use of online technology. Over a quarter (27%) say that their parents do not use any methods (technological or otherwise) of keeping them safe online and a fifth (20%) say that they use technological filters. </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Almost the same proportion (17%) report that their parents encourage them to use websites about internet safety, and 12% say that their parents sit with them while they are online and watch what they do.</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> Further written responses included ‘offering non-intrusive advice’ and ‘trust’, which illustrate an aspect of the online safety debate which is often overlooked: the relationship between parent and child and its bearing on the development of trustworthiness. This reinforces the argument for increased education for children/young people and parents, ideally helping them to develop a continued dialogue about the use of the internet.   </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">3.6 Under 18 is a broad category; while we agree that there is some material that no-one under this age should be able to access, there are also many grey areas: some things that would be completely off-limits to a primary-school child might be fine for a 14 year-old. Just as in the offline world, older teenagers are expected to have much more independence than young children; what would be appropriate for a 7 year-old and for a 17 year-old to view or engage with online are going to be very different. CHIS (Children’s Charities Coalition on Internet Safety) suggests the possibility of allowing different user accounts to be set up for users of different ages in a single household, via routers that are built for this specific purpose; BeatBullying supports this, with the caveat that age verification systems need to be more advanced in order to ensure that it works as it should.      </span></p><p style="line-height:16pt; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">4</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Filtering out extremist material, including images of child abuse and material intended to promote terrorism or other acts of violence</span></p><p style="line-height:16pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal">4.1</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Leading on from parental responsibility, it is important to recognise that the technical safety features of these sites are integral to the sites themselves.  It does not matter where a user accesses them from, on what device, or through which network, the safety features remain consistent.</span></p><p style="line-height:16pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal">4.2</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">BeatBullying is completely in agreement with the principle of blocking genuinely harmful content such as pornography but could not endorse any system that might deny access to legitimate information, advice and support around sensitive issues due to over-zealous and inadequately nuanced filtering.</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">It would be valuable if categories subject to filtering were broken down into more meaningful neutral, positive and negative sub-groups, such as: ‘Eating disorders</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">—</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">general information’ (neutral), ‘Eating disorders</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">—</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">advice and support for prevention or recovery, such as the charity Beat’ (positive) versus ‘Eating disorders</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">—</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">pro-anorexia (negative)’ and parents could make a separate decision in each of these distinct categories.</span></p><p style="line-height:16pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal">4.3</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">BeatBullying is in favour of the Government’s ‘pre-select to on’ approach to filtering.  This option has the virtue of simplicity for parents, setting up blocks as the default and requiring a conscious and deliberate opt-in for certain content.

While we believe that the majority of parents are responsible, there is a minority who might lack either the capacity or the will to make informed decisions in this area. That is why we take the view that having automatic blocks on some content, which can be removed by adults if they choose, would be the best option to ensure a balance between guidance and freedom, thereby protecting children more effectively.</span></p><p style="line-height:16pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal">4.5</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">It is important that in a time where technology has outstripped the capacity of law enforcement, filtering and blocking is not just at the feet of parents; it is imperative that search engines and ISP’s actively challenge themselves to work towards an advancing solution to an on-going problem.

This perfectly illustrates the point that a significant proportion of negative online content is generated by young people themselves. Given this, it is a concern that any discussion of technological blocking and filtering systems in isolation does not take into account the interactive and user-generated nature of some harmful material, which is likely not to come within the scope of a filter anyway. To our knowledge, it is not possible completely to block interactions such as bullying or ‘sexting’, although, as outlined above, there are both technological and human ways of curtailing these and limiting the harm done. </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Blocks and filters can only block and filter; they cannot educate children about how to deal with the kind of content and behaviour they might encounter online, how to manage their own behaviour responsibly or why certain material is harmful. </span></p><p style="line-height:16pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal">5.5</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">That is why BeatBullying has been calling for several years for education programmes focusing on behaviour and addressing issues such as cyberbullying and e-safety, to be introduced into all schools.

The implementation of this can be greatly facilitated by a solid technical framework of support from business, such as Claire Perry’s work with internet providers to introduce preselected parental controls or the adoption of the measures listed in para 4.6 above.</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; margin:9pt 0.75pt 6.75pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#222222; font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal">5.8</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="background-color:#ffffff; font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">More than 1,700 cases involving abusive messages sent online or via text message reached English and Welsh courts in 2012.

Some negative online behaviors such as cyberbullying and sexting are most likely to be a form of child-on-child aggression rather than adult-generated; in order to tackle this successfully, it is crucial to work with perpetrators as well as victims to address the attitudes that underlie the behaviour. </span></p><p style="line-height:16pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">September 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div><hr style="width:33%; height:1px; text-align:left" /><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn1"></a><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt"> Launched May 2013 with The Sun Newspaper following the tragic death of Ayden Olsen Aged 14</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn2"></a><a href="#_ftnref2">[2]</a><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt">The Online Behavioural Habits of Young People Today</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt">, which questioned a 1000 8-16-year-olds and 1500 parents from</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt">Parentdish</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt">and BeatBullying, July 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt"><a name="_ftn3"></a><a href="#_ftnref3">[3]</a><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt">Parental Internet Controls Survey: Children and Young People’s </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt">(</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt">2012</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt">)</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt"><a name="_ftn4"></a><a href="#_ftnref4">[4]</a><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt">The Online Behavioural Habits of Young People Today</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt">, which questioned a 1000 8-16-year-olds and 1500 parents from</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt">Parentdish</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt">and BeatBullying, July 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt"><a name="_ftn5"></a><a href="#_ftnref5">[5]</a><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt">Virtual Violence II Part II: (2012) BeatBullying</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt"><a name="_ftn6"></a><a href="#_ftnref6">[6]</a><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt"> Launched May 2013 with The Sun Newspaper following the tragic death of Ayden Olsen Aged 14</span></p></body></html>
