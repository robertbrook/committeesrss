font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">Local government funding has become significantly more centrally-controlled in the period since the 1960s.  In the past 40 years, two major inquiries have examined local </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">authority</span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt"> finance.  From 1974 to 1976, the </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">Layfield</span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt"> Committee undertook a major review of the subject.  Between 2003 and 2007, the Balance of Funding review (led by Nick </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">Raynsford</span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">, MP) and the Lyons Inquiry considered the question, albeit in an environment where the possibility of radical change was much reduced.  Between these two periods of reflection, local government taxation was reformed twice, in 1989/90 and 1993.  The political impact of introducing and then abolishing the community charge (the ‘poll tax’) was so severe that national politicians, including the Scottish government, are now locked into a policy of capping and freezing local taxation.  Cities in England have been particularly affected by this change because of their relative dependence on central grants: when resources are increasing, inner urban authorities have tended to gain relative to other areas, but when reductions in grant are made, they are more exposed to cuts in funding.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">These changes to local government funding have taken place in parallel to a radical restructuring of the British economy.  Between the early 1960s and 2014, many cities have seen their traditional industrial base shrink.  At the same time, new sectors have emerged, though with different needs in terms of skills and location.  All the conurbations within Britain continue to have a significant legacy of industrial dereliction and pockets of under- and unemployment.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">City governments have, since the troubled years of the 1980s, developed new policies and expertise in their efforts to regenerate their central and inner areas.  The evolution of city regional machinery has complemented the efforts of individual city councils to lead improvement.  In London, the Greater London Authority has been able to make longer-term plans and lobby for resources.  But in doing this, city governments have had to operate within a public finance system where central departments determine policy, allocate resources and make all major investment decisions.        </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The UK and England in an international context</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">The UK has the most centrally-controlled system of public finance of any major OECD country.  The simplest way to judge this assertion is by considering the taxation determined by sub-national government (local government and any regional or state tier) in the larger OECD nations.  The taxation attributable to sub-national government as a share of GDP is 16.1 per cent in Sweden, 10.4 per cent in Germany, 8.8 per cent in Spain, 6.5 per cent in Italy, 4.6 per cent in France and 1.7 per cent in </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">the United Kingdom.</span><a name="_ftnref1"></a><a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">   The UK figure consists entirely of council tax.  Even if the proportion of non-domestic rates retained by councils since April 2013 (in reality, a hybrid of a grant and local taxation) were added in, the figure would only rise to perhaps 2.5 per cent.  The UK is a substantial outlier by international standards.  Moreover, as council taxes in England and Scotland are capped and frozen, it would be appropriate to see the UK as a country where virtually 100 per cent of taxation is determined by central government. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">The UK is also unusual in having only a single tax (council tax in Britain) available at the sub-national level.  Most cities in other developed countries have access to a number of different tax sources</span><a name="_ftnref2"></a><a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">.  Until the introduction of the New Homes Bonus (NHB) in England, there was no fiscal incentive for authorities to increase the tax base because equalisation subsequently removed any growth in that base.  Even the current arrangements, where there is a short-term incentive, have been made less effective because (a) NHB resources are ‘top sliced’ from central funding and (b) in the capital the government has decided to use part of the yield to fund the London Enterprise Panel.   Non-domestic rate (NDR) retention, which started in 2013-14, allows councils to retain a proportion of any growth in the tax base, though within a highly complex infrastructure of central support and subject to an unpredictable, periodic, ‘re-setting’ of the overall funding system.  A number of major cities have negotiated City Deals with Whitehall which allow them to retain NDR growth in the longer-term, to fund infrastructure improvements.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">In short, cities in England have little fiscal autonomy, only modest and unpredictable incentives to build up their local tax-base. Moreover, they have to second-guess the centrally-determined funding environment for future years.   Most cities overseas have significantly greater autonomy, do not face regular reforms to the local funding system and can plan their income sources in the medium-term with reasonable certainty.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">England’s place within the UK</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">Scotland and Wales, which have been granted substantial devolved power since 1999, are each in the process of being given increased autonomy over locally-raised taxes.  Stamp Duty, Landfill Tax and, potentially, income tax will in future be determined in Edinburgh and Cardiff.  Local government finance is already a devolved matter.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">In England, there has been no devolution.  Government is largely run by a number of Whitehall offices and by a series of nationally-appointed </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">quangos</span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt"> with responsibilities for resource-allocation and/or service regulation. Local government, including city </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">councils and city regional authorities, is responsible for a number of residual local and agency functions.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">The willingness of successive governments to devolve powers and resources to Scotland and Wales owes </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">much</span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt"> to their history as nations.  But the decision to transfer to Edinburgh and Cardiff responsibility for most domestic legislation and, now, tax-raising powers carries with it the implication that the post-1999 devolved governments are capable of competent administration.  Thus it has proved.  Yet in England cities and city regions have fewer powers than either the devolved administrations or comparable places overseas.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">Greater Manchester has total ‘gross value added’ of £50bn, more than that of Wales (£47bn). The West Midlands (former metropolitan county area) also has a larger GVA than Wales. Birmingham alone has an economy two-thirds the size of Northern Ireland’s.  London’s GVA (£310bn) is 60 per cent bigger than that of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland added together.       </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">The Treasury and other parts of government will argue there are a number of potential risks from allowing cities or city regions a degree of fiscal autonomy.  First, there might be a weakening of the Treasury’s control of the UK economy, public </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">expenditure and the deficit.  Second, there is a fear that extreme or irresponsible politicians will somehow take control of city halls.  Third, there is a fear within Whitehall departments of losing control over their </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">own </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">budgets and service responsibilities.  Fourth, there is a perception that local civic leaders are somehow less competent than national ones.  Finally, the baleful experience of reforming the rates and community charge between 1989 and 1993 has made all national politicians fearful of making changes to local taxation.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">There are good responses to all of these challenges.  Perhaps the most convincing is the ease with which the administrations in Scotland and Wales have assumed control of virtually all central government responsibilities without mishap.  Devolving power has worked.  In England, contemporary city leaderships are self-evidently moderate, pragmatic and effective. The single biggest obstacle to reform is the fear within the Treasury and service departments that they will lose control of spending levels and provision which can only be run effectively by them.  International experience suggests more balanced (that is, less centralised) constitutional arrangements are not a problem.  Devolved and decentralised models in virtually all other countries work effectively.  Chicago, Frankfurt and Lyon are no more ‘out of control’ than British cities, but they have greater freedom to innovate.      </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Why change is required</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">In recent decades, efforts to reform council or city funding have been met with listless fatalism within the core of government. It is recognised that something should be done, but no one feels the system is powerful enough to bring about change.  Central government, particularly within England, has become so centralised that, ironically, it finds it hard to address many issues. It is too strong, yet too weak.  The prime minister and senior Cabinet members now have hour-by-hour responsibility for detailed provision across England and face a continuous barrage of crises in hospitals, schools, the welfare system, public service regulation and </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">quangos</span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">.  Devolving financial powers to city government would make the Cabinet’s job easier and would place responsibilities more sensibly.  Reform is necessary to protect and enhance the British constitution.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro';
