Thank you for your letter of 29 November asking the following further questions following my appearance before the Home Affairs Select Committee on 12 November. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt; text-decoration:underline">Two years on from the 2011 review of CONTEST, are you satisfied that the planning assumptions upon which the strategy is based are still relevant? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">2. I am satisfied that our planning assumptions in 2011 continue to be relevant. They do not mention Syria specifically though they do refer to the likely increase in activity by Al Qaida affiliates and their exploitation of instability in the Middle East. Syria of course reflects these broad trends. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt; text-decoration:underline">Are Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia and Nigeria still the priority countries for our counter-terrorism work overseas? What about Syria? What is the risk regarding the conflict in Syria? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">3. Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia and Nigeria remain priority countries for our counter-terrorism work overseas. Syria has also become a priority. We face the threat of a terrorist attack conducted against this country and our interests overseas from Syria based groups; these groups may make use of foreign fighters (including - but not only - people from this country); foreign fighters, particularly those returning to this country, may also pose a threat to us in their own right. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt; text-decoration:underline">One assumption from the 2011 strategy is that there will continue to be isolated individuals who engage in terrorist activity in the name of extreme right or left-wing views but they will not present as high a risk as AQ. Is that still the case in light of the </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt; text-decoration:underline">Pavlo</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt; text-decoration:underline"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt; text-decoration:underline">Lapshyn</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt; text-decoration:underline"> case? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">4. We believe this assumption remains valid. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt; font-weight:bold">Overseas Capacity Building </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt; text-decoration:underline">How many overseas capacity building projects are the UK involved with? Please provide us with a list of countries and a brief description of the purpose and activity of each of the projects with reference as to how they are funded i.e. fully by UK Govt or jointly between UK and EU, jointly between UK and US etc. Please give us a detailed case study of a capacity building project including its objectives and how its effectiveness would be measured. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 8.45pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">5. We do not publicly disclose the location, number or purpose of all our counter terrorist capacity building projects overseas because they very often have a counter terrorist operational purpose. UK and third country personnel working in these projects may be at risk from terrorist groups. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 8.45pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">6. Capacity building is coordinated by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and concentrated in countries from where there is a terrorist threat to the UK or to UK </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">interests. In general these projects aim to strengthen the capacity of these countries to investigate, detain, prosecute and convict terrorists in a manner which meets our human rights obligations. Programmes are mainly funded from the FCO CT Programme Fund which in 2013/14 is £30m. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 8.45pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">7. Many of the projects are part of the Government’s Justice and Human Rights Partnership programme, which was announced on 14 February in a speech by the Foreign Secretary. I am aware that you have written separately to the Foreign Secretary about that programme in the context of your inquiry into counter-terrorism. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">8. While you will understand that I cannot go into details of the programme, one example is the CAPRI (Counter-Terrorism Associated Prosecutorial Reform Initiative) programme in Pakistan, which aims to increase the number of terrorism convictions in Pakistan by developing an effective CT legislative framework and improving capacity within the CT criminal justice system, working with the Pakistani police, prosecutors and judiciary. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt; font-weight:bold">Foreign Fighters </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt; text-decoration:underline">Would the draft EU PNR directive improve our abilities to monitor those who we suspect to be foreign fighters and, if so, what work is the UK doing to ensure that the EU PNR directive is passed by the European Parliament? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">9. The Justice and Home Affairs Council has made clear that tackling the issue of foreign fighters is a priority for the EU and we are working closely with our European partners and meeting frequently to discuss means of practical co-operation. The Government considers that PNR (including intra European PNR) and API can support work on foreign fighters and continues to lobby for PNR at the European Parliament. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt; text-decoration:underline">How many UK foreign fighters in Syria are thought to have joined the al Qaeda linked groups </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt; text-decoration:underline">Jabhat</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt; text-decoration:underline"> al Nusra and ISIS? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">10.

Mr Mohamed has two ongoing cases against the Government. The first is an appeal against his control order and TPIM notice, and the second is a civil damages claim. We continue to keep these cases under review. While his abscond is not in itself a ground to stay his litigation, Mr Mohamed is under an obligation to meet the requirements set by the court for pursuing that litigation and his lawyers may only act on his behalf as far as they have instructions. It is for the court to determine whether these requirements are met and ultimately, whether these cases should proceed. These are civil cases and are therefore not dealt with by the CPS. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Charles Farr, Director General, </span><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Office for Security and Counter Terrorism</span><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">January 2014</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:6pt 0pt 0pt; text-align:right"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:6pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
