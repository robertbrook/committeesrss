In Staffordshire, we ‘commission’ in order to secure better outcomes for our residents, focusing on what makes a real difference. This informs how we spend our own money but also encourages us to influence how other organisations spend their money and look at the contribution of residents and communities themselves.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Our strategic commissioning approach promotes spending as much time as possible establishing what question we are trying to answer, establishing an in-depth understanding of our residents’ needs and using this information to inform what we invest our resources in. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Basically being clear why we are commissioning. By getting this right, we have much more of a chance of success and will procure exactly what is needed. This approach also helps to support de-commissioning decisions and avoid repeat re-contracting due to lack of evidence of impact. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Implementing a new framework needs detailed work to align support processes including finance and crucially procurement. In this respect procurement proffers a strategic role in that they can support current delivery, the transition to a new model and then integrate with the new service. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">At the same time procurement is an essential process within the commissioning framework, delivering value for money by maintaining operational excellence and controlling cost. Historically procurement was the means of simply acquiring goods and services, but increasingly there is a need to see it as a means of introducing commercial insight and objectives into decision making to ensure that value for money and cost are controlled throughout the delivery of services by the public sector. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Our submission will follow the same format as the questions asked by the committee under the following themes: Delivering Value for money, collaboration and access to skills and expertise. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">1)</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Delivering Value for Money </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">a)</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Staffordshire County Council has undertaken a process of developing its procurement from ‘good’ to ‘great’. Procurement is seen as an integral part of the county councils development in becoming a strategic commissioner and securing the best outcomes for our communities.  Our procurement team has won 11 National Awards for its innovative practices since 2009.  We are finalists in 2 categories for this year’s CIPS awards in September.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">b)</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">However, procurement is very much a means to an end, meaning that we have redesigned procurement to be run along commercial lines as part of a performance management system emanating from the Medium Term Financial Strategy. The </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">objective is managed by the procurement process on a commercial basis to reduce the cost of supply. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">c)</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">In reducing the cost of supply we are looking to sustain the low cost through the life cycle of the contract. This means looking beyond the initial tender price and looking at the ongoing cost of the procured item.

As a council we spend around £500m per year on goods and services that we increasingly look to spend locally, whilst still complying with EU procurement legislation.  Our procurement team has won national awards for its work in this area. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">c)</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Part of this is removing barriers to local suppliers by becoming a customer of choice. This involves approaching our procurement from the perspective of the supplier and ensuring that local firms can access opportunities with the council – this ensures that we maximize the impact of our procurement locally whilst maintaining our focus on costs.    For example, by the sensitive use of ‘</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">lotting</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">’, i.e. dividing contracts into districts of the county, all milk drunk by Staffordshire school children comes from local tenant farmers and is supplied by a local supplier.  All our seasonal fruit and vegetables are also supplied by local suppliers.  We were awarded the West Midlands Federation of Small Businesses Award for the Best “Small Business Friendly” Procurement Policy in 2012.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">3)</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Collaborative &amp; joint opportunities </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">a)</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Overall</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Staffordshire</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">County</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> Councils innovative strategic commissioning approach has required a cultural shift to the role that we play as part of a wider public sector.  We currently provide a procurement service to 4 of our District Councils and are in discussions with the Police to do similar.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">b)</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">In addition to our use of performance management to look at activity, outcomes and cost we have a wider responsibility to support our partners and work with them.
