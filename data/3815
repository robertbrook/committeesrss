Finding new ways to encourage the media to cover the collaborative aspects of committee work more frequently as well would be useful for public understanding. Since this goes against the grain of most political news reporting, human-interest stories that come out of sessions could perhaps draw them in. For example, the Select Justice Committee secured more thoughtful coverage about parenting following its report on their pre-legislative scrutiny of part of the draft Children and Families Bill than this issue usually inspires.

A greater emphasis on the scrutiny of practice when communicating about committees would be consistent with the latest academic thinking on policy processes (Davies, Nutley and Smith 2000; Stacey 2011) but would also appeal to the public.

Some political commentators refer to male MPs as cerebral and dwell on their political abilities but on women MP’s appearance. When members of the Treasury Select Committee were rated by journalists for their performance at one session of their inquiry into Barclay’s fixing of rates, the men MPs were given between 5/10 to 8/10,while the three women had 4/10 (unfairly in my view) (Elliot and Treanor, 2012).

At the same time it is highly commendable that committees are also experimenting with ways to broaden and strengthen public engagement. When calling for evidence committees might also consider soliciting suggestions for witnesses at the same time, particularly witnesses who do not usually have the opportunity to influence policy-makers.</span></li><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 21.3pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The Liaison Committee has suggested that principles of diversity and inclusion should influence planning (rec. 31).  Since Committees understandably invite witnesses who represent the interests of wider groups, certain groups are less visible in enquiries: for example, young and elderly people. Visits by committees allow interaction with these groups. Partly to amplify this, it would be extremely positive to hold more discussions, and even formal hearings, out of Westminster, not just for the quality of enquiries but for the reputation of parliament. Commissioned research to seek the diverse and varied opinions and reflections of these groups could be used more often as well. The Child Rights Director and Children’s Commissioner consult children regularly and have already assisted parliament in ensuring that their voices are heard on issues that affect them. They could assist committees more regularly in facilitating (or advising about) consultation with young people.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Process of questioning and public engagement</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="21" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 17.85pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The language and process of ‘taking evidence’ from ‘witnesses’ in a ‘hearing’ gives the impression that select committees are like courts.

Many MPs already adjust their style of questioning to be far gentler when talking to junior civil servants, experts or members of the public to understand their views. But more could be done to reassure witnesses that they are not in a court but rather in a scrutiny committee of parliament that is interested to learn from their perspective. New witnesses might be offered the chance to meet with a staff member before giving evidence to discuss what is involved.</span></li><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 17.85pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The guide also states that opening statements are rare and</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">so witnesses should put such views in writing</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> (p9)</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">. It is clear that this is efficient when the committee is short of time.  Deft witnesses manage to convey what they want to say irrespective of the questions they are asked. However, for those that find the court-like atmosphere alien, or even intimidating, the opportunity to convey what they deem to be most urgent is sometimes lost. Although they can write in advance, not all MPs have time to read all the written evidence and this leaves no scope for ideas to emerge collectively in discussion with MPs. Articulating a position can be far easier when you meet your audience because you can adapt your language to make it clear to that particular group of people in ways they will understand (as MPs are expected to do everyday).</span></li><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 17.85pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">MPs already appreciate the importance of the art of questioning but in the insane rush of MPs’ multiple roles, the calm required to ask good questions can be difficult to find. Some MPs (with or without guidance of officials) excel at designing the best question for the appropriate moment, e.g., not leading the witness but asking open questions if trying to discover their view; avoiding aggression if a defensive witness is unhelpful; or a precise, clear question repeatedly put if a Minister is attempting to be evasive, and so on. Guidance from MPs with long-standing experience, and advice from social science researchers, would complement the existing useful training provided by barristers, who specialize in a particular kind of questioning.</span></li><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 17.85pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">It would be worth regularly commissioning research (e.g., by the Hansard Society) that reviews committees’ public engagement – one of the most positive aspects of the work of parliament – to see (a) how different groups of people (public, journalists, professionals, MPs, academics) found their experience of giving evidence to different committees, (b) how these groups understand and view select committee work. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Notes</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 36pt; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none">(1)</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0145w6g"><span style="color:#0000ff; font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; text-decoration:underline">http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0145w6g</span></a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> and </span><a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/364643/Concerns-over-shared-parenting"><span style="color:#0000ff; font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; text-decoration:underline">http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/364643/Concerns-over-shared-parenting</span></a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> and </span><a href="http://www.politicshome.com/uk/article/67990/justice_committee_report_children_and_families_bill_scrutiny.html"><span style="color:#0000ff; font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; text-decoration:underline">http://www.politicshome.com/uk/article/67990/justice_committee_report_children_and_families_bill_scrutiny.html</span></a></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 36pt; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none">(2)</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><a href="http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/witnessguide.pdf"><span style="color:#0000ff; font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; text-decoration:underline">http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/witnessguide.pdf</span></a></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">References</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-indent:-14.2pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Bourdieu, P.
