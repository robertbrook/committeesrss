Perhaps I could start with you, Professor Gibbins. The Grantham Research Institute at LSE told us that, overall, CCS is expected to meet between 12% and 37% of total electricity demand in 2050. What role do you envisage CCS playing by the middle of the century?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Gibbins</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think by the middle of the century I would not concentrate so much on what fraction of electricity is being supplied, which is important, but also what fraction of fossil fuel that is being used is being captured and stored. As far as the climate is concerned, that is the more important metric. You need to consider what role fossil fuels will be playing in the middle of the century before you can answer that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In that situation you should very seriously consider whether or not we have any global consensus on how to tackle climate change. That will be a big determining factor. Clearly if there is no agreement that we are going to tackle climate change, I do not think people will be spending a lot of money of carbon capture and storage or on any low-carbon initiative. However, if we are tackling climate change—bearing in mind that</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">that we probably have in known reserves, according to IEA greenhouse gas figures, about three times more fossil fuel than we can safely use by 2050—we now have a system where we have a surplus supply and the IEA greenhouse gas in the 2012 World Energy Outlook predicted falling fossil fuel prices. In that situation,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">provided it can be undertaken with carbon capture and storage, we might see more fossil fuel consumption than some models that assume rising energy prices have predicted.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I am not answering your question directly, Chair, because we have this big contingency: will the world actually tackle climate change? If it will, then—perhaps perversely—you might see both more CCS and more use of fossil fuels because we can now do it and they are cost-effective.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q64 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Clearly, if we do have CCS, it will become safer to use more of our fossil fuels, but at the moment someone who takes a mildly questioning view might say, “The only serious work on CCS is how do you receive public subsidy in various ways in various parts of the world? If this was a technology which was nearly commercial you would expect to see some of the very big energy companies investing much more heavily in research from their own resources.” Do you think there is a risk that, even if the world wants to go on consuming fossil fuels, we may not have economically viable CCS soon enough?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Gibbins</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think we have economically viable CCS as of now. There certainly very few low-carbon energy supplies being rolled out in large quantities that do not need significant subsidy as against market price. We have seen an example where nuclear appears to be taking some form of subsidy; that has been referred to state aid rules, presumably on that basis. We see significant subsidies for renewables. I would say that, at the very limit, you could argue that a carbon price is also an implied subsidy; it is certainly over there because of Government intervention. Apart from the use of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> for enhanced oil recovery, as far as I am aware there is no way that it could become commercial. Equally, there is no way that any technology that generates electricity at higher than the market price can be deemed commercial, yet we see many technologies generating electricity at higher than market prices being sold in significant quantities. Thereby, they are deemed commercial, but I do not think that they are commercial in the sense that you were using the term.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I think carbon capture and storage would deliver low-carbon energy at a lower cost than a number of technologies that are receiving subsidies and being sold in commercial quantities.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q65 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Without digressing too far, I can see the point you make about those technologies that receive a direct subsidy, either from consumers or from taxpayers. If it is generated by a cap-and-trade system, the carbon price could be argued to be one that does have a direct benefit to carbon capture and storage in that it raises the cost of emissions from plants that could deploy CCS. That is a bit more technology-neutral in a way, isn’t it?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Gibbins</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is technology-neutral if it is allowed to be technology-neutral, because despite having a carbon price, we have technology-specific subsidies as well. I will perhaps defer to my colleague here, but the theory behind providing a subsidy is that carbon price probably would work quite well in a steady state, but when you are in a transition phase it is not so good. Just taking carbon capture and storage as the example, you would expect to start out with the carbon price being low and rising, whereas the cost of carbon capture and storage, because of learning, starts out high and falls. Just left with that situation, nothing would happen until the price was crossed over or until a little while after the price had crossed over.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What you want to do is to do a little bit of carbon capture and storage, get some learning, then do a bit more and a bit more and a bit more, and the only way you can do that is if you find some way of passing out the cost of that to people. You do not want to do it by putting a carbon price up to whatever the first plant would need—say, £80 a tonne, because that is what the very first of the kind needs—and then dropping the carbon price as you learn by doing it. It just would not work, not least because, if you did get a carbon price of £80 a tonne, you would not get the one or two first plants you wanted; you would get everybody doing it. You do not want that; you want a gradual, ordered process. So, great, once you reach steady state, but for the transition, carbon price is perhaps not the appropriate mechanism.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Reiner</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Just to come in there on this, the biggest challenge I think is one of the credibility of Government policy. The study you refer to is one of many studies that will presume our accomplishing our 80% commitment by 2050. I think what you see in the investment decisions not just on CCS but on any other low-carbon technology is that that is not perceived by the market—it is not perceived by the major energy companies operating with the UK as credible.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Even closer to home, we have a £70 a tonne carbon price-floor that is meant to be in place by 2030. I would argue that if you look at the investment decisions being made, that also does not treat what is a very significant potential carbon price as credible. The market, investors, have not quite believed that that 2030 commitment will be delivered. What you wind up having is what has unfortunately been a short-term emissions-trading system, which operates across </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, which gives you quite a volatile price signal. As we have seen over the first transitional period, 2005 to 2008 and then 2008 to 2013, you see the price bubbling along at €20 a tonne and then collapsing. That does not do very much for investor confidence in technologies such as CCS that require an investment time horizon that is at least a decade and probably longer.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gibbins</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> terms of incentives and technology-neutral incentives, you are probably aware of the mechanism that has been proposed by Chris Davies in his submission to the European Parliament.

I think that is an interesting combination of the two things and perhaps it gets over this problem of how you manage your transition in one area. The eventual transition might be that if you have to capture 100% of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> when you use fossil fuel, you do not use fossil fuels at all; you use an alternative technology and that is fine. It manages the transition and also gives you a reasonable measure of technology neutrality, but it does also directly address the problem of fossil fuels, which is fossil carbon going into the atmosphere. It promotes the only way you can stop that, which is by capturing some of it. It is a halfway house but may be effective.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Neufeld</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is also important to think about how targeted the investment is in terms of research and pushing forward carbon sequestration.

What we have seen between 2004 and 2013 is an increase in public awareness of just the words “carbon capture and storage” and the idea of carbon capture and storage from about 5% to about 20%. By the same token, we have not seen any increase in understanding of what that does, which at a very simple level would be to ask, “Does carbon capture and storage address climate change or water pollution or ozone depletion or toxic waste?” In fact, again between 2004 and 2013, those numbers are still very low. For example, the British public cannot differentiate between whether something called carbon capture and storage addresses climate change or ozone depletion or air pollution, and that knowledge has not increased. In spite of the fact that those of us who pay attention to energy issues, those of us who pay attention to climate issues or might be spending the better part of our lives working on it, will see more and more newspaper stories about this, and this is now the second inquiry—there was one in 2005—by Parliament on CCS. So those of us working on these issues perceive there to be </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">more attention to this, but the general public does not see that at all. By contrast, with something like shale gas, about half of the British public says that they have heard about it or read about it in the past year.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q68 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir Robert Smith:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Have you analysed their understanding of it?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Reiner</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We have looked a little bit at that.

Recommendation 32 was, “Clear and transparent information about CCS at an early stage will be crucial for securing public acceptance. The Government must therefore adopt a proactive approach to communication”. And 33, “The Government has done little so far to engage the public in a dialogue about CCS technology. We accept that it is early days for the technology but previous experience has emphasised the value of early engagement”. Here we are almost nine years later and I do not think those two very legitimate recommendations have been taken on board. I do not think there have been efforts to engage the public, to design simple educational materials. It is very difficult to reach a diffuse public—for example, inserting materials into the educational system, finding ways in the course of debate to bring and develop those sorts of materials, I think it has been a bit of a lost decade in that respect.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q70 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir Robert Smith:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It has also possibly been a bit of a lost decade in developing the policy itself.

At one level you find very strong approval ratings for renewable technologies but you do not find that same willingness to pay. When you factor that into the reality of the debate, it is not quite as clear as to what the preferred option would be, factoring in costs.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Gibbins</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I very much agree with your suggestion that it is very hard to make people aware of something that does not exist. If we can get some real projects going, then that will increase awareness. Perhaps in terms of what the public would like to see, again it depends how the question is asked. I think if you pose the question, “Do you think fossil fuel suppliers ought to be made to pay to stop fossil carbon going into the atmosphere?” people might say “Yes,” even though it would add to their costs. Whereas if you said, “Do you think we should pay for the cost of electricity to clean up the carbon?”, they might say “No.” It is a lot in how you phrase the question.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Reiner</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: One thing to say again is that the reality of projects does help. I was speaking with somebody at Statoil who was saying at one point during the mid 2000s that their budget for helicopters transporting the press out to see the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Sleipner </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">project was enormous, because every week there was an Australian or a Singaporean or a Chinese television programme that wanted to feature this, essentially, completely unhelpful platform in the middle of the North Sea, as a way of demonstrating that reality.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">So the sense of being able to kick the tyres does have an important role, and it probably says a lot that we do not have a single major demonstration project even on the storage side.

We have done work in a number of European countries on this, and it is particularly true that onshore storage creates the most concern. Working with colleagues as part of a Framework Programme 7 project two or three years ago, both in Germany and the Netherlands, onshore storage generated quite a bit of negative reaction and concern over the associated risks—health risks, safety risks and so on. You find less of that in the context of offshore storage. Countries like </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Norway</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> or the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> or the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Netherlands</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, which also has its current projects going offshore, do not generate nearly that same degree of concern.

The image, the impression, that most people would have of a coal-fired plant would be something that is from their parents’ or their grandparents’ generation.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Gibbins</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Also, a slight variation on that, I think people’s approval of gas is because they think gas does not need carbon capture and storage, which is pretty erroneous. A carbon dioxide molecule, no matter where it comes from, does exactly the same damage. Also, low-carbon electricity produced with CCS from gas can be cheaper than low-carbon electricity produced with CCS from coal. It is interesting that even James Hanson, who is revered by a lot of environmentalists in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, said for a long time, “The problem is coal. We have to stop burning coal and burning coal with CCS. Gas is okay.” Still, I think the acceptance of gas does not include gas with CCS. That is something that the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is leading the world on in saying that we have to be consistent and we have to do CCS on all fuels.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q74 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Graham Stringer:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Can I just go back to your first question, Professor Gibbins? When asked about the case for carbon capture and storage, you said the politicians either have to do it now or wait for a crisis to come along and that will sort it out, when there is an international agreement. That is a bit of a body swerve, isn’t it? There is a great deal of public money going into mitigation or renewables just from this country alone. What I would like to hear is you make the case for carbon capture and storage against renewables, if that was a powerful case. We may well have to wait some time for an agreement but while that money is going in I would just like to hear that case.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Gibbins</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: You are right that a lot of money is going in. I think you would find at the moment that a lot of people in the Government—I would include civil servants as well as politicians—if you said, “Could you even consider spending some money on carbon capture and storage instead of renewables?” would just say, “The legally-binding 2020 renewables obligation. We cannot do anything else.” It is the case we do have a legally binding 2020 renewables obligation. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We have tried making the argument and we have had it turned down. I think you have to be a little bit sympathetic, particularly with the Ministries that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">would be responsible, if, for example, the UK Government was seen to take active steps that would lead to a failure to meet its legally binding 2020 obligationl; it would be liable to penalties from the Commission for wilfully failing to meet it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">You are asking me to make the argument for doing it, but I am telling you that I believe there are strong legal reasons why nobody listens.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q75 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Graham Stringer:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think there are very difficult political reasons and legal reasons the way things are set up.

A lot of the money that has been spent on renewables I would say dates back to a period when climate change was not a priority. It dates back to a period when we perceived a shortage of fossil fuels—I can certainly remember that time—and we thought we needed to come up with non-fossil forms of energy just so we could keep our society going. That was a lot of the origin of the renewables spend in the 1980s. It lapsed a bit but then it came back.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I do not think that the idea about how you translate a renewables policy into serious mitigation has been thought through. For example, given that we have an emissions trading scheme, all of the money spent on renewables is of no value whatsoever at all for mitigation, because the emissions from the regulated sector—which is where most of the renewables generation goes—will essentially always reach the set cap. If you generate electricity from wind and thereby you do not need to use coal or gas, those emission allowances are freely available to be either used in the UK or elsewhere in the European system, and there is not a lot of thought that we will not get up to our cap.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Part of the reason that we are not able to make a very good argument is people are not analysing and not prioritising mitigation over and above renewables. If you want me to tell you why we should spend the money on carbon capture and storage, there are a couple of answers to that, but they are all related to: what are we spending this money for? If you think you are spending the money to achieve a result in global climate-change mitigation, then the amount of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> that we save—which as I say is functionally zero at the moment because of the cap and trade system—even if we did reduce </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, would have no particular bearing on the global outcome.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What we need to do is to influence the global outcome, inasmuch as we can. I take the Chair’s point of view that perhaps that is influencing an EU-China relationship, although that remains to be seen. But whatever influence we have, if we were to spend money on carbon capture and storage at the margin, and we are perhaps talking about spending only 10% of the total amount spent on low-carbon electricity by 2020, that would give us several plants, which would be a very significant amount of global activity on power generation by that time, perhaps a third or a quarter of power generation, perhaps even 100% of the action on natural gas. That would get noticed. That is a big deal. It is a big deal partly because the technology is novel and partly because there are no other motives for doing carbon capture and storage other than mitigating climate change.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Pretty clearly, if we got the equivalent value in wind and perhaps solar, the influence of that—whether that is even noticed in places like </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">China</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—is extremely doubtful. I suggest it would have absolutely no influence whatsoever. We are not going to build a nuclear plant by 2020, but if we were to, again that would have a little bit of notice but very barely in places like </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">China</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">USA</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> who are quite able to do nuclear. So there is no </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">guarantee that spending money on CCS will influence global outcomes, but at least you have a chance and you have a plausible mechanism, whereas I suggest that by spending that amount of money on alternative energy forms, which are already being built in fairly large quantities, there is no material way that that can have an influence.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">If you want to look at it more directly from our own economic advantage, in terms of real economic advantage, it is global mitigation that will matter in the long run. In the short term the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> potentially has significant economic advantages from carbon capture and storage. That comes from the geology, as we have already heard from Dr Neufeld. We have good storage available. It is offshore and it is not too politically controversial. In the longer run, what is going to matter if we have a carbon-constrained globe is not access to fossil fuels but access to somewhere to put the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> when you use fossil fuels, because you will not be able to put it in the atmosphere. So the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has a significant economic advantage in that respect and it is one that people cannot take away from us.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">For example, you could say that the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> should get advantage over making and selling low-carbon generation technology. Perhaps, but that is a very competitive market and there are larger markets. But stuff that you have from your geography and geology, you have it.

I would like to move now to Dr Neufeld. You started to answer the previous question. What different types of geological storage are there within the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United Kingdom</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and around our shores?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Neufeld</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Principally in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> the storage options are almost exclusively offshore—the east Irish Sea and the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">North Sea</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. They fall into three broad categories, which are old natural gas, old oil acreages and saline aquifers. Out of those, the first two have the great advantage that essentially they have already been mapped out because of the cost that you get from extracting the natural resource—the natural gas and the oil. In terms of characterising both geophysically and geologically, those are the places where we already know a fair amount about storage options. We know that a buoyant fluid, be it natural gas or oil, was trapped for centuries, millennia, in these formations.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The key question, if we want to take advantage of our opportunities and push the technology forward, is to ask: are there places like saline aquifers where we can learn about how to take advantage of a whole range of geological structures?

These are the kinds of questions that some early investment could push forward.

The Grantham Research Institute—the LSE—said there could be 62.7 billion tonnes just within the saline resources, so that is nearly as much as the total you gave. That is very significant. You also said very clearly that you would have to test for leakage. What is our understanding of the potential for leakage at the present time?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Gibbins</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: To be honest, I think at the present time all of the major CCS pilot projects that have been run have been run under the understanding that this is a first-off and we had better not leak. They have almost uniformly injected into ideal geology where—to put it very crudely—you had a porous reservoir, you had a very impermeable seal, and in some cases this is hundreds of metres thick in terms of an impermeable rock. So there is basically zero chance of it leaking in these scenarios.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The question of leakage is one that is slightly more nuanced than it should be. Current policy says that you define the containment area where storage is to be held—and that is some area within the subsurface—and that leakage constitutes any escape of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> out of that boundary. This is a very high standard. If your boundary is 2 kilometres down and the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> escapes to 1.5 kilometres down, it is not clear that that is either a clear and present danger to somebody on the surface, nor it is clear that this is going to change in any way, shape or form the carbon budget from sequestration. In some sense, a greater clarity from the policy standpoint on what constitutes leakage in terms of permitting would be very helpful.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q79 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Graham Stringer:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Assuming that we are not talking about something a mile down, how would you monitor on the surface to reassure people that carbon dioxide was not leaking?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Gibbins</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: In many ways you can monitor surface fluxes of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.

The question again is not only </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> fluxes in the subsurface. Certainly if you are down hundreds of metres you can do that seismically or you can do that geochemically.

I think it should come back to what it is exactly that we are demonstrating. It is true with regard to CCS, but arguably it is true as well with regard to other low-carbon technologies and our climate-change policy more generally that we do not really think very carefully about what it is that we are doing with our findings. What we end up seeing is essentially billions in subsidies for deployment and barely millions in subsidies or support for something that would be much more akin to learning, whether that is in terms of learning that would tell us more about the subsurface, or learning that would allow us to drive costs down in terms of capture, or learning what would allow us to build offshore wind turbines in a way that does not require tonnes of concrete. I think we are not necessarily formulating the question in a way that is helpful. It almost guarantees that we end up spending many billions building plain vanilla onshore wind turbines, or building what might be a very large-scale capture plant, when we could have been spending the last decade doing a number of these experiments or projects, on a much smaller scale, that would have significantly contributed to what we are learning.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">As John mentioned, an example of this is the issue of gas with CCS.

That is still under debate, but if it were to go ahead then I think there would be a fair bit of learning by doing coming in from the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’s projects and from the billions.

That was done because there was there was a baseline survey before injection started of isotopic analysis and that did not match what was going on.

Certainly saying that you are prepared to do it does not achieve the benefit that I was alluding to, but doing it does and you can only do it by demonstration. The point I was trying to make there is that, arguably, the countries that you are trying to persuade—and now we are trying to persuade China generally on carbon capture and storage, and the United States specifically on gas CCS, because the law in the USA exempts gas from CCS, whereas it is proposing to make it mandatory on coal—I think both of those markets are perfectly capable of generating the technology themselves. The fact that we have demonstrated it shows that the technology is there and that it can be done, but they know that. What they do not have is a mechanism that pays for it and the commitment that pays for it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Arguably I think that is still the more innovatory part of the overall process, and that is perhaps where I am coming in and saying showing that you are prepared to pay for it and showing that you are prepared to pay for CCS on gas, even though people think it only emits half the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, as I say, that might still have more effect than just saying it is technically possible, because people do know at the moment that it is technically possible.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q81 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Graham Stringer:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> My final question is are we in the lead with this technology or are we following?

They are all quite significant variations on the previous ones. Yes, there will be learning from it. That is what life is about; that is a really good thing.

What that means is we have had to think a bit more seriously about a policy design and how a policy would allow a CCS project without the immediate side benefit of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> EOR from being economically viable.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Again, in global terms, the notion of marrying capital support and the variable costs—the CFDs that would underwrite the CCS projects—is a novelty. Arguably there is room to go further than that. For example, we do not allow for these first two projects to run other than on base load. One of the things we could be learning, which policy design might allow us to do, would be to ramp up and ramp down and understand how the capture plant might react to that. There are opportunities in the policy design process to bring in or to allow for learning, but I would argue that—particularly in this globalised context—one of the few areas where the UK does have some ability to say, “We are doing something innovative and different” is in terms of policy design and policy support.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Gibbins</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: As Jerome was telling you, we are doing a lot of innovation in offshore storage as well.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q82 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir Robert Smith:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I want to go back to storage with Dr Neufeld.

Even if you could be convinced that it is fine, the fact that you think others might not be willing to buy your property because of a newfangled thing will potentially give rise to opposition.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Particularly for the first few projects, until these projects get off the ground, there is a need to be particularly sensitive.

Because it has the word “</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">”— which as I have alluded to might also be confused with carbon monoxide—there are a number of ways in which the first few projects are particularly susceptible.

It is just knowing those places that are going to affect people in that way. Quite legitimately you may not be able to persuade them that it is not a problem, and the best thing is not to go near them.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Fortunately, because we have offshore storage and coastal power plants, we are in a good position to do that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Thank you very much.

Anybody who is a chemical engineer looks at carbon capture in a completely different way from all the people at the Government and the power industry and everything else.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The gas industry and the chemical industry have been using—what you call—carbon capture under a different name on a global scale ever since at least 1910. I started a chemical company and we were capturing vast quantities of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in the Billingham chemical works, making chemicals and coal, long ago. So we regard the capture element as completely proven.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">If you work in the gas industry, a gas is a gas is a gas. All natural gas contains </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. We are very familiar with it. So we regard </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> transport as a non-problem and future storage as a non-problem because we have been storing vast quantities of natural gas underground—which is far more hazardous than </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—on a global scale for 40 years, putting it down, taking it out again, putting it down again. It is our national gas storage, so we regard all of these as non-problems.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What we are most interested in is looking at how to optimise the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> process. The two big problems with CCS are energy consumption and cost. The cost arises from two things: there is cost of building the CCS plant, but also, because it has a parasitic energy consumption, which absorbs a large part of the energy its host plant is producing, you have to build a much larger plant to produce the same amount of energy at the backend. That is about at least as big a cost again as the direct cost of the capture plant. So the critical thing we need to do is to get this capture energy down.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Any first-year chemical engineering student would know that from the physical fundamentals of developing a good capture process, what you need is the maximum possible pressure of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and the maximum possible carbon dioxide concentration and freedom from other contaminants. Those are conditions that you find in the petrochemical industry, in natural gas processing and areas like that, oil refining.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The exact opposite occurs if you try to capture </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> from the backend of a coal power plant. You have virtually zero driving force because the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is so dilute you have to stand on your head, using extremely active solvents, to persuade it to dissolve. These solvents then capture the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> very strongly, so they now need a lot of heat. You have to virtually boil the solution up to get the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> out again, so using large amounts of energy.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The plant is physically very large because the gas flows are enormous. The gas flows are enormous because most of what comes out of the back of coal-fired power plant or a gas-fired power plant is nitrogen from the air. The stream is basically nitrogen with a small amount of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, so your plant has to process about 50 volumes of nitrogen for every volume of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> you are trying to remove. On the other hand, if you decide to target your capture technology on processes that do not dilute the gas with nitrogen, automatically the plant is much smaller. So we need to focus on doing </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> capture where it respects the physics.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">You are all familiar with a can of Coke. If I pull the ring pull on a can of Coke you get a fizz. The fizz is </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. The </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> was dissolved in the water at a very modest pressure, the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">pressure of the can, and all you had to do to release it was to pull the ring pull. No heat required at all.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">These technologies—they are called “physical solvents”—have been proven in the petrochemical and natural gas industry for over 30 years. I can go out tomorrow and I can buy about four competing solvents with a commercial guarantee, and they use a tiny fraction of the energy of capture on a power plant of either type, gas or coal.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It is a matter of what you want to do. There are two issues about carbon capture. If you are forming policy one issue is the tonnage of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> you are trying to remove and the other is the cost. Virtually all the policy focus for the last decade and more has been on how to remove the maximum tonnage, and it is quite true that the maximum tonnage is coming out of power stations. But we now seem to be finally waking up and realising that what we ought to be focusing on much more is cost. If you want minimum cost, the smaller quantities of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> that are available from these processing industries, where high-pressure equipment is used and carbon capture is fully proven—you can go out and buy capture technology tomorrow with no research—the carbon capture costs there are a fraction of what they are for a power plant. So we perhaps need to do both but we need to focus much more strongly on the industrial sector.

The IEA 2050 blue map scenario is that CCS captures nearly as much </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in total as all the renewables, including large hydro, and they expect half of that CCS capture to come from industry.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q85 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Does anyone else want to try to answer this question a little bit more briefly?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Darren </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Hopkins</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes, I would like to talk about biochar briefly. The recognition of biochar being a carbon capture and storage technology is very outdated now because of the potential use—it is called the cascade effect—of using biochar several times before the product goes into the soil for the sequestration value. It is the added net reduction in emissions from the cascade use of biochar that gives it a head start in the CCS arena, because not only do we capture </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> but we can give an exponential reduction in carbon generated and environment benefit to boot.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rodney Allam</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The problem with CCS capture and storage is that it is too expensive. It costs 50% to 80% more to generate electricity when you capture carbon dioxide using the existing methods that are available to us, which are amine, oxy-fuel and IGCC. They can be applied basically to natural gas and coal.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The motivation for the work I did—which is now incorporated in the NET Power cycle—is to recognise that the process of power generation has to be totally different. The obvious choice of working fluid in that system is to use </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> itself. If you burn a fuel in pure oxygen, the products are basically </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and water. If you drive your turbines with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> rather than steam or, in the case of a gas turbine, using air, you will have a system that will naturally produce, once the water is condensed, pure </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> as a product that must be emitted by the system for it to remain in mass balance.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">When you develop such a system, you can produce a system that has a lower cost of electricity than any existing fossil-fuel-based power system and at the same time simultaneously remove all the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. I know it sounds like magic, but this thing has been properly designed and verified both in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and here, in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> by NETL, here by the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Royal Academy of Engineering. It has also been verified by the DOE and it has been verified by our partners, Toshiba, CBI and Exelon. So we have the partnership that we need to develop this system. We have a major turbine manufacturer. We have a major EPC organisation with very extensive knowledge of building massive power stations, and we have a very large operating company that has thoroughly evaluated this and believes it is the system of the future.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We want to develop this system because we believe it is the only way in which significant reductions in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> emissions on a worldwide basis are possible. It is ideal for very large power stations.

In the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> the advantage is that the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> can be used immediately for EOR, as previous speakers have said. In this country we would emit the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.

We use a pressure of 300 bars for the combustion. We use a turbine with an outlet pressure of 30 bars, so the system operates over those pressures. We can take </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> off at any pressure, either pipeline gas at 150 or as a fluid at 300 where its internal energy is so high that the additional cost of liquefaction and the additional power is very small.

We invest in technology development and technology demonstration, so logically you would probably expect me to say, “Here are a range of different technologies that we should be using for CCS”. My view is slightly different, which is that right now we have a range of technologies that are available, that have been demonstrated in the market at various scales, but none have been demonstrated as a full system demonstration at full power plant or full industrial plant scale.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The real challenge we have right now is not one of technology, it is about investor confidence in the market. That is the critical issue we have to address: it is to sustain confidence. In many ways that means we should not be going into a wide spread of technologies but should be focusing on a few that show very real promise.

When we look at the UK system, what we are seeing is that the opportunity in implementing CCS—not just on power plants but on industrial sites as well and in other applications that we can get on to potentially—the prize there is to reduce the cost of the overall energy system in the UK by over 1% of GDP, recognising that at the moment we spend about 9% of UK GDP on energy and the energy system of the UK.

The combustor has been fully tested up to its full operating pressure at a scale of about 30% of the size of the one we will use in the first plant. These things have to be demonstrated for the industry. It is such a new thing that it needs industrial confidence, which can only come from at least a one-year demonstration run, virtually a continuous output, on a particular plant.

That is really the only application in power systems. Using fossil fuel, you substitute an oxy-fuel burner with the heat that comes in from a nuclear station.

It effectively takes the total available biomass that could be used for biochar production and then, using a pyramid system, would then gradually work down to the total and viable amount of potential biomass available.

As a result, using it with the high-efficiency carbon CCS efficiency technology embedded in the gas production plant—for example, such as Mitin’s technology but there are others that would be nearly as good—we can generate carbon neutral or slightly carbon-negative methane at a competitive price with today’s natural gas price.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:21.25pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">This technology has been running at full scale in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Germany</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> for seven years.

It was going to be to manufacture this synthetic natural gas from British Coal. The technology is proven on coal. The Germans licensed it and used it instead on waste and biomass. It has been operating on a full commercial scale. The only reason you have not heard of it is it makes chemical synthesis gas instead of gas for the gas </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">grid, but the backend technology to make the gas for the gas grid was already fully proven by British Gas 20 years ago and was a major element of Government policy.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:21.25pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The technology exists. It was proven. It was British-developed, although some of it is now foreign-owned because of lack of interest in the meantime. I would strongly recommend a look at this. The point being we should not just be looking at the power sector. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is a global problem.

We need to look at where the cheapest </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> removal options are. It turns out most of them are outside the power section, particularly the gas grid. You can do this on a very large scale.

The first one is to recognise the scale of the numbers I just mentioned and what is involved in actually delivering those. When you look out for the future, in terms of meeting climate change targets for the UK, if you look at the development of the UK energy system—and for simplicity if I talk about power for a second—then in terms of major power generation sites the assets that we have are clearly expiring in terms of life. They will be gone over the next 10 years. We are already in a rebuild programme and that is going to continue over the next 20 years, obviously.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:21.25pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The real take-off in infrastructure investment in terms of the power sector particularly, is from the mid-2020s onwards. That is when it really starts to happen. The implication of that is that whatever the technology and whatever solutions we are going to have in place for 2025 onwards, we have roughly 10 years to prepare them and convince the market that the Government is serious about supporting those from a policy point of view in the future. We believe that for CCS, the cost of that activity is a few billion pounds between now and 2025. That comes mostly in the form of a series of CCS demonstrators. We have one feed study currently committed through DECC for the Drax White Rose partnership activity in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">South Yorkshire</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. There is a second one that is hopefully going to make its way through the system in terms of the Peterhead Project in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:21.25pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">From an investment community viewpoint, the critical issue is that we do not falter—if I can put it that way—around those projects, that we continue with those and we continue with the momentum they will create in industry in terms of delivering those and delivering subsequent projects. The cost for all of that over about 10 years is a few billion to have industry confidence and investor confidence in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> as a market for CCS. The prize is saving £300 billion over the subsequent 20 to 25 years in terms of roll out of the plan.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:21.25pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The two things for Government I think is to recognise the scale of those numbers. It is basically a few billion now to be prepared to launch a major programme around CCS deployments on a mass scale from 2025-ish onwards. Recognise the numbers. Secondly, sustain progress around the current demonstrators, such that industry can see that the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is serious about CCS as an application in the future.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:35.45pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q98 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Graham Stringer:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Mr Allam, I have listened carefully to what you were saying.

If we can deploy this first plant and get to a point where we can start work on the production plant, the commercial plant, and get that in operation—as we hope by about 2020—then we have a mechanism in place for taking a fairly significant share of this new investment that is required in energy generation. It will have an enormous effect, number one in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, and number two because of export potential.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:21.25pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There will also be a huge market in parallel in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">America</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> because I think the two things in the end will move in parallel. Certainly, the first demonstration plant is very favourably located in this country for the reasons that previous speakers have been talking about; the imperative to have a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">-free power system, the need to have diversified fuel sources, and the need to have low-cost power. All of the problems that were discussed in the first hour of the presentation were really revolving around issues of subsidy. These issues of subsidy are things that are going to be with us unless we recognise that current methods of carbon capture are just too expensive. They all require very massive subsidies.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:21.25pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I am not here to attack any of the other methods.

Without them, we would not be anywhere near where we are in terms of considering almost at the decision point to implement this plant; whether it goes to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">America</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> or whether it goes to this country.

It turns out that the site at Teesside is not only ideally suited in terms of pipeline supplies of oxygen, natural gas and services. It is also a place where we can get a lot of pure hydrogen, That is a key to using the first system to produce simulated coal gas. We emit </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, so if we have a hydrogen supply with a simple piece of extra equipment we can manufacture simulated coal gas and operate this system on coal gas at the right composition to take all the risk out of implementing it as a coal-based system.

What both Governments in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and EU has being doing is giving a very strong political system that there was a mandatory target for RE—renewable energy—at any cost. Mandatory targets are a much, much stronger signal than some kind of market-based mechanism. CCS was more or less left to fend for itself on the expectation that the European ETS would make the current price high enough that CCS would become viable. Now actually we find it is quite clear that that was just not going to happen.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:21.25pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We have had 10 years of that history where there was a strong mandatory target to decarbonise emissions via RE, and no similarly strong political signal to do advanced CCS which—as we have heard in the evidence—is significantly lower cost. The International Energy Agency say the savings of CCS relative to RE are even bigger than the ones that David said.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:21.25pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The problem is how do you undo that, because industry has got used to the idea that what the Government really wants is renewables? We are now getting a signal in the new Energy Act that you now want to level the playing field, but we still have a situation where we still have a mandatory target for the renewables. We have a very generous published CFD number for offshore wind, but we do not have a published number for the CFD on CCS. It is the CFD that, in the short term, before the carbon price rises much higher, is going to be the only serious driver that will make CCS happen.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:21.25pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I am not sure that simply parity of Government support between CCS and renewables is going to be adequate to undo 10 years of a massive disparity. I think you perhaps need to think about going beyond to persuade industry of this vital industrial confidence that Government really wants CCS. The problem is we are talking about very long-lived plant.

The Scottish Government and the Scottish councils have put considerable additional commitment behind that as well, in terms of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Northern North Sea</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and the Mid Central North Sea. Without looking at the detailed qualification of the numbers, I think you would have to say for the R piece there has been a quite considerable level of support and that has been well received and focused well into a few key centres in terms of the UK, UK academia in particular.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:21.25pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The demonstration piece at the other end, we have had long-term commitment around building power fund for a full chain demonstration. We are now getting close to the launch of that; certainly, the feeds for the way for the first one. I think that commitment has clearly been welcomed by industry. It has clearly been delayed along the way for various reasons. I think part of that has been over-optimism as to the reality of how long it takes to set up this kind of high-risk contract in an uncertain environment. But that commitment has certainly been well-received.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:21.25pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It is in the space in between in the development piece, where there has been the biggest gap. That is where ETI has put most of our activity; is in trying to take capability from the research piece into a form that delivers value for the demonstration elements. Perhaps the easiest example to date is the storage appraisal project where we were able to take the outputs from the academic research base, both in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, provide funding which allowed those groups to amalgamate around a particular deliverable, which was a storage database in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. They took all of their data, and a whole range of new data that we were able to make available through that project from commercial sources, and created the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> storage appraisal. That is now the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> stored database, which currently the States are licensing to groups who are looking to develop sites.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:21.25pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I think that has been a great example of the pull-through of how we can fill this gap in the middle through groups such as myself.

In discussion with National Grid, they concurred with that through their use of the database.

There are retail products on the market that you can buy. This is an industry that is happening, and yet it has had absolutely no funding whatsoever from the research councils, not a penny. Yet this is a carbon capture and storage system that is in place happening today. With the support from the Government and a bit of help to push it forward for research, who knows where it will go.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:21.25pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rodney Allam</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> As far as I am concerned, it has been a very, very positive reaction from the Government. We have already had three grants of development money rather than research money and this has pushed our project forward very, very rapidly. It has also pushed forward the opportunity for one of the major suppliers in the Midlands to supply major equipment, which has already been manufactured and delivered for the first demonstration plant, the 50 MW plant. This was due to the fact that DECC was able to very rapidly assess </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">our system in comparison with other systems and come rapidly to the conclusion that we should be supported under a competition that was available to us to enter. I can only say that the way that the policy of supporting demonstration has been implemented in our case, where we are pushing forward very rapidly, has been really very good indeed and we are very pleased about it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:21.25pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Chris Hodrien:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I would like to say we have a disconnect between the CCS demonstration projects and the development. DECC has reasonably generously funded the CCS innovation programme. Unfortunately, the demonstration plants have been subjected to such a high degree of commercial risk—because they were not given any guaranteed access to market for their product, so they had to compete in the open market place—they have had to adopt the lowest risk technology to satisfy the commercial risk criteria. The commercial risk was so high, they could not take technical risks. By definition, the demonstration plants you have are using some of the best proven oldest CCS approaches. At the moment there does not seem to be a mechanism for taking all this wonderful technology that is coming out of the innovation programme, and all the good stuff that ETI is doing, and demonstrating it on a large side stream scale—let us say 5% of the total flow for example—on these well-funded demonstration plants.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:21.25pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There should have been an integrated approach there because you have to get these emerging technologies, which have the potential for very significant cost reduction relative to what the demonstration plant was going to use, and they have to be demonstrated at a significant scale. By “significant scale”, I am talking of 20 MW equivalent at least. That is 10% of the footprint of the plant. Industry are not going to believe the demonstration that stands at the proof of concept scale of 0.5 MW size, which is where most of the developments are occurring at the moment. The demonstration plants provide an ideal platform. I am thinking if we look at the philosophy that has been used in marine energy, where significant Government funding has been put in to create marine energy parks where there is an infrastructure whereby these new technologies can be tested at a relatively important scale relative to that. They are much smaller but at a substantially commercial scale. Some of them are testing full commercial scale devices in a facility that is Government funded, and I cannot see the same on CCS.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:35.45pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q101 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir Robert Smith:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you think that is an opportunity that is too late now because it would disrupt the already held-up projects?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:21.25pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Chris Hodrien:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I do not know.

Please forgive me. I am new to the CCS arena. I think the most important thing that I have taken on board over the last six to eight weeks is certainly that the use of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in the States as part of the CCS regime is obviously a major step forward, because capture seems to not be a problem. It is the storage </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">side that seems to be a problem. Surely, using the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CO2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> if we can capture it for some systems it is better than just allowing it to go up into the atmosphere anyway. Surely, even if it is only an interim stage, to assist the moving forward of the storage sector the Government could implement perhaps a utilisation system that would assist the pathway into that true storage.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:21.25pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rodney Allam</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think the Government’s roadmap is very sound. The challenge is to make sure that the funding is available promptly, so that the development task can be implemented without major delays at each stage. It is very important to have a continuity so that you can proceed quickly to a point where you have plants in operation. It is a question of speed at the moment.

I think opportunities have been missed by focusing Government’s entire CCS attention on the power sector. As I said earlier in my presentation, it so happens that CCS costs are relatively quite high in the power sector and much cheaper in certain but not all industrial sectors. They are much cheaper in the petrochemical and natural gas processing sector. We already have something like 100 operating carbon capture units in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in these sectors. The cheapest CCS plant is the plant you have already built. There is huge opportunities in CCS in the gas industry using this synthetic natural gas production, where you can produce carbon neutral gas at source at a competitive price needing relatively little subsidy—I am not saying none—and then supply this to existing gas-fired power plants.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:21.25pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Given that about 40% of our total electricity is generated from gas-fired power plants, you can decarbonise the fuel supplies then at course cheaper than attempting to put CCS on power plants themselves with no disruption on the power plants, no change to their flexibility or their means of operation. We need to be looking at the big picture.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Thank you very much for coming in.
