Many of the strongest cases never reach the permission stage of ju</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">dicial review because Local Authorities settle. The way the proposal is now worded will force issuing of proceedings, when the reality is courts encourage parties to try and resolve matters if at all possible before issuing. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Please see attached case stud</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">y 3 in the </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">below</span><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> paper: AES and Siblings.
