font-size:12pt"> Thanks to all of you.  We really value it, not least because of your involvement in campaigning but also your direct personal experience of being disabled.  Both those things are really important in helping us to understand the issue.  We are very aware that when we travel to developing countries, we very often do not see disabled people; they appear to be invisible and not often on show.  They have been called a forgotten minority, although they are a large minority.  Do you think this is true and, if so, why?  What has contributed to their being marginalised or forgotten?  Also, perhaps more positively, could you give us some examples of what you have witnessed?  We will then move on to what responses there are or should be.  Who would like to start?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Ola Abu Alghaib:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Social exclusion of persons with disabilities in low and middle-income countries occurs for different reasons.  One certainly is the stigma and the attitudes of communities aroun</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">d the perception of disability—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">one that is more from the medical point of view, in which people with disabilities are seen more as patients that need to be treated.  The other main reason is the environment around them and the rights perspective.  They are not seen because they are not integrated into communities.  In addition, they do not have equal access to services.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In terms of positive points of view, we have seen on the ground</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> that</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, when there is a sincere support to persons with disabilities in terms of accessibility</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">in terms of support for inclusive</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> education,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">for example—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">children with disabilities were able to integrate into communities and act as normal children, if I </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">can </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">use that term, even in the context of conflict.  I have seen it in refugee camps in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Palestine</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.  I have seen it in rural villages, where children are carried to school on the shoulders of their mothers.  However, when the school is ready to accept those children, it is much easier.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mahesh Chandrasekar:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Lack of support in the community</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> as well as a lack of access to services and facilities open to the public</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> are some of the major barriers that face people with disabilities.  As a result, children with disabilities, especially, are often considered as a curse or burden for a family.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I know of a family in the slums of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Bangalore</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">that has a daughter with cerebral palsy.  She had difficulty walking and both her parents worked hard to ensure their children attended school.  Somehow they managed to get a second-hand wheelchair for her to go to school and one of her siblings was ready to take her.  Unfortunately, when the school she wanted to go to was not accessible and did not have accessible toilet facilities, all the school could offer was, “This is what we have.  If you want, you can come and support your daughter whenever you want to.”  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">This was not a practical solution because her mother was working as a house-help in many of the houses and her father was a painter who would get jobs on and off.  Therefore, she dropped out of school.  In poor communities, children like her, and children with multiple intellectual and psycho-social impairments</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> are left at home all day, making them vulnerable </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">to abuse.  When they become victims, they do not have access to justice and the stigma adds to this.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There is a growing gap between disability and development—this is termed by Leonard Cheshire Disability Resource Centre as a disability development gap.  In order for people with disabilities to have equal access to development programmes, especially those supported by DFID, they need to have a systemic approach on inclusion of disability, as they have explicitly and systematically included gender in strategy, business case, logframe, annual reviews and evaluations.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Edwin Osundwa:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I have two little experiences.  First of all, as a person living with a disability, because I now contribute to development through the work that I do, through my participation as a taxpayer in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Kenya</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and through my support for other people, it is likely perceived that my disability has diminished</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Tha</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">t is normal, just because I participate meaningfully in what the rest of society perceives to be a positive contribution.  That is how greatly integrating a person with disability into development can turn around the fortunes of such a person.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Secondly, as I work with Sense International, I hear and experience cases where a mother who has given birth to a deaf-blind child, for example, has to quit her job because she has to take care of her deaf-blind child.  That becomes a double tragedy for the family, because that mother stops earning a very important income that would sustain the rest of the family members.  As soon as the mother stops working, in most cases the husband may desert that family.  That compounds the problems that such a family experiences.  This is just around the issue of resources, poverty and a lack of access to the equal opportunities from which other members of society benefit.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I believe strongly that development is about inclusion.  It is about participation of all people at whatever level, and whenever there are obstacles, we need to address them so that everyone can contribute in their own ways.  That can definitely reduce the discrimination, stigma and problems that we face.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We have been told that only about 4% of disabled people benefit from international aid, and you have all identified some of the reasons why there is exclusion.  What do you think donors can do?  I will bring in Chris White in a minute; in fact, it may be sensible to bring him in before you answer this question.  We are interested in what a donor like DFID can do to change that situation.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond;

</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chris White:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> My question is about the countries where you work.  Have you had the opportunity to observe DFID’s mainstream programmes?  What I mean by mainstream is those that are not specifically targeted at disabled people.  How do you think disabled people were able to access these programmes and, based on your experiences, what more do you think DFID could do to make its programmes more inclusive?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> This is your opportunity to say what you think DFID could do for you in your community.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">Palestine</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, specifically to see how much attention has been given to disability.  In particular, when I reviewed DFID’s strategy for 2012 to 2015, I only saw disability mentioned once in that strategy, and it was only on the cash transfers component.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Unfortunately, when reading through the document, if I were a country representative or a head of mission of DFID implementing programmes and I only s</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">aw</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> disability mentioned once, unintentionally, the indication I would get is it </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">is not a mainstream strategy to integrate it within other development projects.  An indication and a piece of advice to DFID is</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> that</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> if we want disability to be really mainstreamed within the development programmes, it has to be strategised</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> first of all</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> through a document that clarifies DFID’s position, in terms of addressing disability as it does for gender </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">issues. There should be an</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> assurance that there are technical references and participation of people with disabilities when designing those programmes, but also clarifying indicators, as is done with gender issues, so that it is determined, when a programme is implemented, what needs to be addressed in relation to disability.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I can give you another specific example in relation to USAID.  In 2011 USAID provided infrastructure support to Ramallah area, which is the central area of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">West Bank</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, and they forgot about the simple ramps in the street pavements.  Therefore, millions of dollars were spent but, because there was no indicator saying it had to be disability friendly, none of the streets were made for people with disabilities to move around, and it is less costly if that is considered in the beginning.  That is why it is really important to have an understanding of what needs to be done for disability to be integrated top down.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt"> Before the other two witnesses come in, can I specifically ask you: have you taken the opportunity, or has there been a mechanism for you, to challenge these programmes before they have been implemented?   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt"> and addressed that specifically.  They showed regret that, unfortunately, within that project it had not been addressed and they will ensure it is addressed in the future.  However, it was a lesson learnt by them to consider that in future development projects.  For me it was an indication of that.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mahesh Chandrasekar:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> As DFID does not have an explicit policy on disability inclusion across all of its development programmes, it is difficult to answer this question of whether DFID’s programmes have reached the disabled or not.  Programmes targeting girls and women should have specific competence to address the issues of girls and women with disabilities.  In rural areas and urban slums, a majority of women with disabilities are not part the women’s </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

it is really considering the consultation process with people who are appointed across the different ministries as focal points, as is the case for gender, for example, in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">Germany</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, where they have just launched their action plan for disability inclusion starting from 2013.  It is a three-year programme.  AusAID have started their own programme for disability inclusion from 2009.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">All these stages for mainstreaming and looking at this issue seriously is where DFID can play a major role in playing the lead, because DFID has, in the past, produced excellent reports on how to address disability by using the twin-track approach.  Way back in the year 2000, they talked about poverty, disability and development, whereby they said there should be progress for mainstreaming poor people with disabilities.  At the same time, there should be specific programmes to make sure that people with disabilities are able to catch up with the rest.  DFID has an excellent track record of spearheading the issues of disability but, unfortunately, over a period of time, I do not think it has caught up.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">This inquiry provides a big opportunity for DFID to play that role of having something that is more proactive with a more clear-cut policy and with steps that can measure how disability inclusion has happened.  It is not only a question for DFID.  As a person with a disability, a disability activist and a DPO member, for me, the policy is very important because I can hold DFID to account in terms of how they are doing their work to ensure it has meaning to the lives of disabled people in the country as well as at an international level.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It is perceived as the old terminology of disability.  The challenge is that Handicap is more the French translation of the word rather than the English.  However, I know that debates are still going on within the organisation to consider that.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In talking about societal attitudes, how long it will take and what needs to be changed, timing is an issue because changes in society take time.  We cannot predict that.  The perception of disability has grown with people over many years with the understanding that it is linked to a curse or a burden on the family or community, and that it is an additional cost and it requires technical expertise.  For all of that to be resolved within a year or two is not realistic.  However, regarding the steps required for it to happen, I have seen it in the context of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">Palestine</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, where we work with communities to change perceptions and attitudes.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">First of all, there has to be change in the policy system.  There have to be enforced rights and laws to ensure proper inclusion of persons with disabilities.  First of all, it is my right to be treated equally in a workplace.  The second element is support for role models.  There has to be support for people with disabilities to perceive what they feel they want to achieve in their lives and usually choice is an issue, so the involvement of people with disabilities and strengthening the capacity of disability organisations are key issues as well, in addition to engaging with media.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Media plays a massive role in changing people’s attitudes.  Until now, if we track the media’s articulation of disability, whether in films or newspapers, it is still unfortunately a negative </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">image.  Therefore, it is about a combination of different strategies and a support system to ensure we reach that target.  However, as I said, it is a long-term thing but it is taking place.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Again, in Palestine, the issue of conflict and the arising of young athletes, men, who were injured in the conflict and are now wheelchair users has changed the perception of disability, because you see them more often, they have a better support system, better incentives and more attention from their families and the communities because they are the heroes.  All of that brought a new insight to disability and changed it so that now, in Palestine, you see a change that has happened over the last 10 years, but there is a long way still to go.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Yes, it is possible to have change.  Yes, it is possible to turn around the entire spectrum.  The reason is, for example, within a space of 10 years, the three East African countries have been able to enact legislation on disability.  Within that very same space, those three East African countries have been able to sign and ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Within that very same space, two of the countries that have reviewed their constitutions, i.e. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That is at the legislative level.  However, at the practical level, we now have ministries with programmes on disability.  We have disability councils, which are </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

if you do not have people with disabilities within your family or in your work space, you may not consider whether new programmes are going to be accessible for people with disabilities.  It would be certainly be interesting to know the staff spread of DFID across the globe and how many of them have disabilities, and at what level they are functioning.  Are they at every meeting or are they only at certain levels?  You should also </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">in which</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> donors are seeking to engage is to work with disabled people’s organisations.  Please, Mahesh and Edwin, do not take offence, but some experts have cautioned that these organisations are dominated by “educated, urban males</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">”; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I just wondered whether you have an opinion on that—whether it is a risk and whether disabled people’s organisations, because of their vulnerability, can be dominated by people of a certain gender, or with a certain disability, and we miss out receiving feedback from people with complex needs and disabilities, and particularly women and children.  Perhaps I can direct that to an urban male, Mahesh.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mahesh Chandrasekar:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> That is very true.  That is why I said in my previous response that it is important that the DPOs represent the constituency with whom they are going to work.  If you are going to work with children with disabilities and if you are serious about hearing the voice of children with disabilities, do we have children with disabilities in those consultancies that we are doing?  What measures are </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">we </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">taking to ensure that women with disabilities and people with certain impairments</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It is important that we look at the constituencies of the DPOs themselves.  That is the reason why I talked about the Young Voices campaign, where we are supporting more young people with disabilities to join the disability person’s movement.  There should be a change in leadership as well.  There should not be the same leader who has been there for all the meetings.  As </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">any other good democracy, there should be elections; there should be new leaders emerging and opportunities created for both men and women as well as representative across disabilities.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">At the same time, it is important that people with disabilities are consulted.  Without consulting </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">them</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, you are not going to find a complete solution.  I would like to give another example: I have access to an incontinence device, which allows me to sit in this room and talk for one hour without having to go for a break.  That is because I am earning; I am able to afford that.  I am able to buy that on a regular basis, but that would not be the case if you are working with poor communities in rural areas.  They may not be able to come out of their own houses because of a lack of accessible washrooms.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It is not that DFID has to look at DPOs that are registered.  DPOs may not be registered.  They may be a collective of disabled people who are meeting informally.  Therefore, DFID should have an open-ended design.  It should not be fixed that DPOs have to be registered.  If DPOs are not registered, would DFID be able to fund those DPOs?  How will DFID fund those DPOs that are not registered to build their capacities?  DFID also has to have a flexible approach to ensure that the voices of the disabled are heard and not fall into the trap of meeting the same people again and again.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">Along with the convention, the disability movement across different regions has revived.  There is a better understanding of the role of the DPOs within persons with disabilities that was not there five years ago.  There is a potential change if we consider, when designing programmes, that, as Mahesh said, yes, there is an assurance that when new members join, when actions are supported, it is open to everyone; it is not restricted to the small community of that DPO.  Therefore, the assurance of the participation of people with disabilities through DPOs is a must.  Alongside that, there have to be indicators for those DPOs to improve along the time of the support and to prove that they are changing at an organisational level and as a movement across that targeted country.  I would advise both tracks.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Thank you.  It is some time—more than a year—since this Committee took the decision in principle that we would conduct an inquiry into disability and development.  There is some evidence that DFID has taken that in</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">to account over the last year. Certainly the Parliamentary Under-S</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">ecretary, Lynne Featherstone, has made a declaration that she wants DFID to be a world leader in disability-inclusive development, which is something that we would welcome.  However, we also recognise, from the evidence that we have just had, that there would be a lot to be done to achieve that.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There seems to be recognition by DFID that Australia is slightly ahead, and from other evidence we have heard, in some areas, so is USAID.  It is good, of course, that DFID is prepared to learn and co-operate with other donors on that front.  At the moment, they have made declarations about accessibility of school buildings, improving data, which was raised in a previous one, and funding civil society organisations, which again has been indicated is not as easy as it might be.  What do you think DFID would need to do to move from where it is now to the</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> rather ambitious claim of the M</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">inister, to be a world leader—apart from follow </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Australia</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’s example, of course?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Bob McMullan:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Thank you very much</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. H</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">aving the ambition is a great start.  There will be different paths but the key elements are, in some way, to have an overarching strategy.  People use different words in different organisations, but to have some overarching document that says, “We want to have the world’s best practice,” that therefore prioritises this as part of the activities of DFID is important in itself.  I will come to some content things briefly in a moment.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> There will be another question specifically on that.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Bob McMullan:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Let me say then why I think it is important.  It sends messages to external bodies that liaise with DFID.  What I found surprising in what was then called AusAID was the extent to which it sent a message inside the organisation and led to organisational change in the agency itself.  That was not in my head when we started but, in hindsight, it was the most important thing and it happened as a by-product of what we set out to do with the strategy and the way we set about doing the strategy, which was a very extensive consultation with disabled person’s organisations and setting up an advisory group of people with disabilities and experts in that area.  That overarching document—as you say we can talk about its substance— its existence and the way you go about setting it up, is the most important thing you can do.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lorraine Wapling:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I would like to support that and maybe take it a step further and say that public declaration, public announcement and public commitment to working towards disability inclusive development is really important, because it sends a message to other international organisations that you are working with and wanting to influence.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The scale, scope and nature of the problem are important.  It is acknowledging that this is a significant development issue.  If you want to tackle poverty, education and all of those </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">things, you have to understand that disabled people need to be included.  If you make that public declaration, it influences the internal organisation itself but it also sends an important message to other development actors, and that is also very important.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Miles</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I endorse all that has been said in terms of making it part of every act of development.  It is not a separate </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">or a specialist issue, and i</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">t must not be sidelined as such.  I do not think I have a great deal to add, other than to endorse DFID’s stand because it is a very influential player.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt"> What we wanted to tease out during this session are specific things that you all think DFID could do, because they are at the start of this process and it would help the inqu</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">iry.  One other thing, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">mentioned in the previous evidence session</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—we are aware of it ourselves—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">is the stigma, which leads to disabled people being hidden away and discriminated against.  We had evidence from Sightsavers, which said, “</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">A lot is invested in changing societal perspectives on gender, and many interviewees commented that disability should get a similar amount of attention.” </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you think that is the right approach or is something slightly different required?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Bob McMullan:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It broadly is; I would not want to take the analogy too far but, to the extent that it is about changing social values, there is a lot to be learnt from what was done in the area of gender—not that there is not still a lot to do there.  In some countries, people with disabilities in families are hidden away, and even where families love them just as much as they do in our country, if there are no resources for support, they wind up, particularly people with mental illnesses, not leaving the house.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There are some terrible stories from </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Indonesia</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, not because of any peculiarities about </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Indonesia</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> but because they have studied it better than some places.  It is not that the families do not love their family members with mental illness but that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">they do not have any support to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">provide them with the assistance to participate in the community.  So, yes, we have so far to go in changing attitudes, but in the developed world we need to change our attitudes so that we engage with this.  The poorest of the poor are people with disabilities in developing countries, and if our development programmes are not targeting them, we are missing the point.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Miles</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Again, I endorse attitude change as the key issue—probably the hardest.  I do not like to think of it as just families hiding children away; it is about the attitude throughout society and sometimes at a very high level, in UN agencies even, that needs challenging.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lorraine</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold"> Wapling:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> By making a str</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">ategic commitment to disability-</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">inclusive development, by having a strategy and a framework, you are making the issue of disability something that is moving away from only focusing on impairment, which is what tends to happen.  It is showing that this is an important development issue.  That helps change the mindset.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In my work, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">often with agencies and mainstream organisations, we do an initial session that asks people to say what disability means to them.  It helps to confront people’s attitudes towards how they conceptualise and frame disability, and a lot of the words and phrases that come out of that, even from DFID officers and senior managers, still reflect an attitude that disability means something to do with impairment.  Therefore, when you are thinking about an agency or an organisation wanting to become more disability inclusive, working on what people think disability means seems like a significant first step, because it helps to challenge that assumption that disability is only an impairment issue.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That is why </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">the issue</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has not really been significant in development up to this point, unt</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">il something like the UN c</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">onvention comes along and makes it much more public.  People are much more aware that disability is a rights issue; it is not just an impairment issue.  Until you challenge that at the core, the agency or organisation cannot move forward with disability inclusion because there is still an assumption that disability is just about specific impairments—a health issue or whatever</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. A</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">s a social development adviser or governance adviser working in fragile states, why do I need to think about disability?  By confronting that attitude and understanding that it is not only a matter of people’s impairments, the agency can begin to move forward.  That is one of the things that AusAID did quite well, and the strategy that they developed and the consultation process helped to change attitudes within the agency itself, which is a very important first step.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Miles</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Your question was about gender mainstreaming, the relevance of disability mainstreaming and the lessons that can be learnt.  There are parallels and it would be great to have disability mainstreaming.  However, it is very clear what gender is; disability is much less clear and well defined, and differently defined in different contexts.  As </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Lorraine</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> says, we need a greater appreciation of the barriers faced, according to the particular impairment and the social context in which we are talking, as there is so much.  It is not as simple as just saying, “Disability mainstreaming, like gender mainstreaming.”  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q23 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr McCann:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We understand that AusAID began their programme by focusing on two sectors and four countries.  DFID has a large number o</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">f programmes across the globe. W</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">here should it start?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Bob McMullan:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> AusAID, as it was, had a large number of programmes across a large number of countries too.  It was not as big as DFID but we did have to prioritise.  It is the right question but there is no perfect answer to it.  When we choose education and infrastructure, we could have chosen several other areas equally well.  It was a combination of the advice we received from consultation with disabled people’s organisations, whether we had the capacity to contribute and some of the countries where we saw we were most likely to be effective.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We were conducting a bit of a trial to see how this idea of prioritising the issue of disability inclusive development would work.  We felt we could not immediately do it everywhere, so we felt the need to prioritise in both sectors and countries.  Ultimately, that is not what you should do; you do it everywhere.  But we felt that we had to start with some caution as a test case.  The strategy is essentially based on the idea that ultimately everything we do in every country will be tested against its appropriateness for disability inclusion, and the special things we do to assist people with disabilities will be done everywhere.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">DFID has a different geographical remit, so quite where it would choose to go were it to prioritise is not for me to say, but I do not think, in the long term, you would develop a strategy based on particular sectors or countries.  However, like all big journeys, you have to start somewhere, and that was how we thought we could start in a way the institution was able to manage.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">DFID, what was then called AusAID and USAID are big agencies, but you cannot turn them on a sixpence.  You have to have a planned strategy for change and you have to prioritise.  I think they turned out to be good choices but I do not want to pretend that they were the only </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">choices, particularly with regard to countries.  There is no country in which you could not properly prioritise this.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lorraine</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold"> Wapling:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The consultation process itself, because it was so widespread and detailed, gave AusAID the opportunity to make a selection, both in terms of country and the sectors that they wanted to focus on.  For me, it was logical to narrow it down and say, “We are going to put specific resources, time and energy into these countries and sectors,” because it enabled AusAID to start to make that organisational transition, to build up the evidence base that it needed to expand and to put in place the support mechanisms that are definitely needed.  Therefore, it was logical to make those decisions.  The exact nature of those decisions came from the consultation process itself.  If DFID were to do a similar kind of thing, I would definitely recommend a good broad-based consultation process happened, and then allow DFID to narrow down the potential.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The other thing is to look at where you already have good practice happening.  When I look at mainstream organisations or other agencies that have tried to mainstream disability, one of the things I notice is that it tends to be more successful if they build on things that are already successful.  Looking at something that DFID is already quite well known for or in a country where there is already a good connection or collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders tends to be more successful in adding something like disability inclusion.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">You already have an advantage there; you already have a good reputation.  This is about improving your effectiveness.  I have seen that working with mainstream organisations and potentially with DFID as well;

F</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">or example, in our volunteer programme we made a particular effort to ensure there were people who could provide services to people with disabilities.  I remember seeing in Samoa the first teacher who was introducing sign language into a school in Samoa, who was an Australian volunteer who had gone there and was opening up education to a group of people who had never had a chance, effectively, to have it before—and not because of a lack of interest from the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We did think that one of the things that was lacking was a lack of research in this area.  That had two features.  One was mentioned by Mahesh earlier, and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">one that</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> you mentioned, Mr Chairman, was about disaggregated data, so that is already on your agenda.  In the Australian </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Government</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> aid programme’s research programme, we had a specific stream in the research programme about research into disability and development, so there was money available for people internationally to bid for to look at research issues around disability and development, because we do not know enough.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What does show up is that, unless you review your current programmes and ensure your future programmes are sensitive to the needs of people with disabilities, most times they will </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">miss out.  I cannot validate the 4% figure myself; it is not research that I did but it is exactly consonant with the on-the-ground experience—that your education money does not go to children with disabilities unless you do something in particular to make sure they can take advantage it.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That is true for infrastructure.  Someone earlier gave an example that is consistent with my experience.  If you build a new road but you do not develop a mechanism for people with wheelchairs to be able to get along the footpath, that means that money is disadvantaging them.  They used to be able to go along as badly as everyone else on the rough track; now they are the only ones that cannot get along the road.  That is what drives the 4% figure, but you would have to get someone smarter than me to back up the number.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt"> One of the things that we are very aware of is that in developing countries issues of diseases and illnesses that cause disability are even more prevalent than they are in developed countries.  I wondered whether you all had thoughts about where prevention comes into this.  Edwin mentioned rubella, but obviously there are many things, like mumps, measles, meningitis and these kinds of things, that lead to disabilities.  Where do these fit into the disability strategy?  This obviously helps to prevent people becoming disabled as well as to support them when they are.  My understanding in terms of AusAID was that prevention was effectively moved into the health sector rather than included.  What was the thinking behind that and what are the advantages or otherwise of taking that approach?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Bob McMullan:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> To some extent</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I am the wrong person to ask this question but I am pleased to be asked it.  My view is not entirely representative because the reason it was moved out of the disability programme in the original strategy was at the request of disabled people’s organisations</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. T</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">heir view was that—and intellectually there is no question there is validity in this argument—the prevention of river blindness is a health question; it is not a question about disability.  In one way that is true.  Take a person with cataracts who has had an operation and before could not see but now can—is that services to people with disability or is it health?  What I am saying is that the dividing line is very blurred, but it is clear that the majority thinking of disabled people’s organisations it that they would like to see prevention conducted under the health programme.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I do not have a view about how it should be done, but I am absolutely of the view that it is an essential p</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">art of a development programme—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">whether you call it part of your disability aspect is an </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">argument about semantics to me.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> However, it is fundamental that you deal, concurrently, with the issue of prevention and particularly in things like avoidable blindness, rubella, the emerging issues around diabetes and things like this.  They are going to cause a massive increase in disability in developing countries unless we do something about it.  It is a fundamental part of a development programme going forward, but you would get a lot of argument about whether it should be in the disability part.  I am agnostic about that.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

it does not belong in any one sector.  It is terribly important that the sectors collaborate.  I would like to raise one particular example that I have direct experience of: running clinics in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Swaziland</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> many years ago, looking at otitis media.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">case in this country until our nutrition improved after the war; it was not the antibiotics, I hear.  So, it is directly linked to nutrition, poor growth and all of those health-related issues that are so essential to prevent further disabling conditions.  Therefore, a disability that is a mild impairment can become a very severe disability if</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

to fit and maintain the hearing aid is a very long process. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-weight:bold"> Wapling:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> There is an issue where you try to put prevention in the same strategy as empowerment and mainstream inclusion.  When you try to communicate the strategy, you come up against some problems.  If you put prevention into the same strategy as inclusive development, when you come to talk to people who do not quite get disability inclusion, they tend to focus on the impairment and that goes back to prevention.  Prevention then becomes easier to do, so your strategy becomes dominated by stuff around prevention.  It is not that it is not important; it is absolutely crucial, but you find it is much more difficult to communicate a disability inclusive development strategy if you have prevention in the same place.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">s difficult to communicate in one way about disability inclusion when you are also talking about how to fix impairment.  It is a problem.  It makes it easier if you separate it, but I absolutely agree that it is a conversation that has to happen in parallel to the conversation you are having about disability inclusion because, from an effectiveness point of view, the more you can prevent, the better it is going to be.  You want to have fewer disabled people, no doubt.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It is also about making sure that rehabilitation services are available.  That is definitely true.  For me, that is a conversation that has to happen within the health sector.  The health sector is huge.  It has a much wider set of stakeholders.  It can engage with many different people.  Disability is very small in terms of the influence and the stakeholders who are involved at the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">moment.  If you want to be able to be effective and efficient with things like prevention and rehabilitation, the health sector is much better placed to be able to help you with that discussion and to be able to implement it.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It becomes a little more complicated around children and education.  That is the point for me where the rehabilitation and health issues intersect significantly.  From an adult perspective of the rehabilitation services available, taking a very bare necessity approach to it, if you want to make the most impact, go with children and think about how rehabilitation services affect their education potential.  At that point, you really need to look at trying to bring the sectors together—health, nutrition and even social protection, come together and intersect with children and how they experience education.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

the second is that we know we can do something about it.  That is a powerful combination of circumstances, and it would be sad to miss it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I remember, when I was in DFID, I did a little survey to do with the understanding of social exclusion.  What came out was an issue that social exclusion tends to be seen in terms of political minorities or women; nobody talked about social exclusion in terms of disability, because people were thinking disability was linked to medical impairments.  There is an issue to do with making sure that, if you are talking about social exclusion, you need to specify disability within that debate; otherwise, it does not come up automatically.  That is one problem.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The other thing is that disability is not just about social exclusion; it is about employment, health, HIV and gender-based violence.  It is about all of those things, and there is a danger that, if you say disability is about social exclusion, you just put it to whoever is working on social-exclusion issues.  If you are doing water and sanitation or health programmes, you do not think about it.  It depends on how you use social exclusion as a sector and what social exclusion means within the agency.  It tends to marginalise disability as an issue even more.  You just have to be straight and to talk about disability-inclusive development.  It is much simpler that way, because it then just means that, whatever sector you are working in, you have the mandate to talk about disability.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt"> Good afternoon, panel.  I have quite a number of questions on schools and school facilities.  If you do not cover all your points with my first question, there are several more.  DFID has recently committed to make the new school buildings it funds accessible to disabled children, but disabled children face less visible barriers to access.  If DFID wants to ensure disabled children can access quality education, what should its next priorities be for those children in schools?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Miles</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I would say teacher education.  It is fantastic that DFID has taken this stand on accessible buildings.  It worries me that that is sometimes limited to physical access.  Intellectual and sensory access is just as important: light quality, so that you can see the teacher’s face, is good for all children, painting the walls white, lowering the blackboards and making the windows bigger.  There are all sorts of ways in which access can be seen more broadly, but it is about the quality of teaching and learning.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That is a crisis anyway, from your 250 million children who cannot read, write or count after four years.  There is a problem with the quality of education.  In the work I did in Lesotho, we found 17% of children in those 350 schools in that feasibility study had some difficulty in learning, so there is a great deal to be gained, I would say, from drawing all teachers’ attention to the issue of disability and difficulty in learning, however you want to describe that—in this country, it is SEN—and that this affects maybe one-fifth of the school population and that it changes from time to time.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Teachers need to see children as individuals, and that is about teacher education, not only at the pre-service level.  It was done in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Botswana</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in the early 1980s but it did not really have an impact.  It has to be in service as well.  There has to be ongoing teacher development.  It is a range of interventions for teachers, I would say.  We expect a lot of teachers in this term “inclusive education”.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt">ition of its partners: n</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">ot only does its direct spending on education need to be accessible, but where it is funding others—its partners—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">it should </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">make it a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">general </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">condition.  Whenever DFID is contributing to infrastructure in particular, that should be included.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The other thing is that, if you want to take it a step forward, you need to disaggregate data by disability.  We need to know who those disabled children are in the school and we need to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">add that to the quality-assurance process, so that we know where disabled children are in terms of the system.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Bob McMullan</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There is a lot, but let me just add one.  It is usually the least attractive proposition.  Making schools disability-friendly does not just mean you can get in; it has to mean you can go to the toilet as well.  People do not like talking about toilets, but it is fundamental to the capacity of students to be able to participate in a school.  That is an immediate second thing they need to do.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt"> My next question was going to be what resources DFID should set aside to take these steps.  If you want to comment on that, please do so, but it is possibly fairly evident.  Moving on, DFID is making increasing use of conditional bursaries and payment by results to improve school attendance and outcomes generally, but is there a risk that these frameworks exclude disabled children who may have more difficulty with regular attendance?  You are nodding, Ms Wapling.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lorraine Wapling</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Unless we come down to looking at disaggregated data, there is a real danger that DFID goes into this results-based funding and could make the situation worse for disabled children, because it is going to be more difficult for disabled children to meet those requirements.  Then schools are going to turn them away, so this needs to be introduced with extreme caution.  The only way to do that is to monitor by looking specifically at what is happening to disabled children.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Miles</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is about standards versus inclusion; that is how I would summarise this.  Thinking about the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> context, we found it helpful to separate presence, as in access—getting through the door—from participation.  The aim is to achieve your potential, which may not be the same as other children, so the idea of standardised testing and learning metrics is problematic with particular children with particular impairments.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">On the other hand, in this country, there has been a great deal of emphasis on academic results and there has been a raising of expectations for children for whom there might have been very low expectations.  I suppose that what I would identify is some sort of differentiation of that payment-by-results policy, some acknowledgement that it is about achieving potential and raising expectations, but not necessarily achieving the same as everybody else.  Does that make sense?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt;

font-size:12pt">Lorraine</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> said.  If you treat people who are inherently unequal equally, it is as unfair as treating people who are inherently equal unequally.  It achieves the same inequitable result.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Fiona Bruce:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> That is a very pertinent way of putting it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Bob McMullan</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is not original.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt"> Dr Miles, you mentioned inclusivity.  Could the panel comment on what you see as the main advantages and risks of inclusive education for disabled children in low-income countries as opposed to separation into special schools?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Miles</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There is an awful lot to say about that.  I would start by saying that it is not necessarily about whether a child attends a mainstream school or a special school in a low-income country; it is either going to school or not going to school.  I can tell you that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Lorraine</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and I have worked together on a report about schools in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Uganda</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, where the national average for deaf children is 2%: 2% of deaf children are in schools.  That includes the special schools and the units.  As a result of the National Deaf Children’s Society’s international support to parents and sign-language training, 8% of deaf children now go to school in a particular part of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Uganda</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> called Bushenyi.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">This was a very particular effort to increase that, but still only 8% are attending, so I do not think it is helpful to go back to the special-versus-inclusive debate that we have in this country, which is built on a very different history than many low-income countries have.  I was in Samoa just a few months ago too, and the history of this field in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Samoa</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is so utterly different from our own history.  There is a very big danger in looking to western solutions, and special education and special schools, and assuming that is an appropriate response.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lorraine</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold"> Wapling</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: In this debate, it is not black and white; it is not one thing or the other.  You have to go with what works.  Above all, what we need to do is to research and find out more.  The real issue for me is that, at the moment, neither system is working.  We have, supposedly, special education happening in countries, but I just did a little bit of research and the reality that we found in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Tanzania</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> was that special schools were no different to mainstream schools in terms of what they were providing.  The children were no better off in a special school.  Even though they had made an effort to get there, there were no resources that were specific to their impairments.  Whether or not the teacher turned up was fairly random.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">At the moment, the entire system is broken, so what is really important is that somebody makes a commitment to saying, “Education for disabled children is important,” and then, “Let us look at what is going to be the most effective in this context,” drawing on examples from other countries where they have made efforts, like Samoa, Uganda and Zambia.  There are examples in all kinds of places, but let us try to look at something that is more strategic and that we think, over the longer term, might make a bigger difference.  Do not, however, hold yourself to one model or another.  It is about the child and about making the commitment to educating that child.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">They then set up units attached to mainstream schools.  It was not mainstreaming, and they were segregated.  They were educated in a unit, but the children in the units where it was very successful were absolutely delighted.  They were very articulate and very intelligent.  Their </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">language was really well developed, because they had the opportunity to interact with each other and other sign-language users, and the teaching improved as a result.  There was integration going on in terms of the community, because the whole project took a community-based approach to education.  It involved the whole community, so there was integration happening beyond the school itself.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That was a fantastic example.  There were problems and it was not exactly perfect.  The other thing is that the local </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">government</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> took ownership, so local </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">government</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> was paying for the teachers in the units.  That was another aspect.  There was local-government ownership.  Local government took the education of these deaf children as being a priority education issue, and they found some resources to enable at least the teachers to be paid, which made a big difference.  It was small scale and there were virtually no resources except for the people, but it worked.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Bob McMullan</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I want to add something that is consistent with this, which is that, in countries with very poor resources, you have to build on what there is.  I do not want to give too many details, because my memory might be slightly wrong, but one of the small Pacific island countries had a specific school for visually impaired children.  It is arguable that, if you started it afresh, you would not have done that, but it exists.  The easiest way to improve outcomes is to improve that school.  Starting afresh, you might not build that school, but it is there and it is there operating at a moderately good level, so the best thing to do is to make it better.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In a different place, the solution would be different because what exists is different.  The Samoan example is different.  The children with a hearing impairment operate, essentially, in a class in an existing school.  That is what you build on because it is there and the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Government</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has made the resources and they can strengthen it.  I think the most important point is the one that was made about not just importing our western debate as to what happens in our system into entirely different contexts.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Miles</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Can I just make one more point?  It is something about which I have learned a lot from doing research in this country as well as in other parts of the world, and it draws on experience in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Lesotho</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.  It is the issue of a whole-school approach.  I know that the example that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Lorraine</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and I have just given was of deaf children in a unit that was, essentially, separate, and there are arguments why, sometimes, it is helpful to have deaf children slightly separate but included.  The danger of importing the idea of a special educational needs co-ordinator, for example, which some countries have done—I think they have done it in Uganda—and making one person a specialist within a mainstream school is that all the problem children whom nobody wants to teach end up being educated by that specialist.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Lesotho</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, there was an insistence from the beginning that every teacher in all 10 pilot schools was trained in what inclusive education</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">Lesotho</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> 20 years ago, and they were the most positive of teachers in that whole programme.  We had a meeting many years ago about inclusive education, and there was a unanimous agreement that class size was not necessarily a barrier.  It does not mean that we would promote large class sizes as a good thing, but there were lots and lots of examples from practising teachers who are used to managing large classes.  When given a little bit of knowledge and guidance on how to teach more inclusively, they did not see large classes as necessarily the big issue.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What we tend to forget with our class sizes of 30—if you are lucky—here is that children are a tremendous resource.  We overlook children as a resource in schools.  Where you have large class sizes—and I know that this is looking on the bright side and that there are problems—children can play a very big role in promoting inclusion through buddy systems, literally walking or pushing children to school and making notes.  There are many examples I could think of where children have played an active role in promoting inclusion.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Miles</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Bullying is an issue for schools in all sorts of ways, not just about disability.  Engaging the whole school and all children in the project that is disability-inclusion is a bullying-prevention strategy.  I concede the fact that it does happen—children can be cruel; teachers can be incredibly cruel—but, where there is strong commitment, conviction and awareness of discrimination and the damage that it does, and a buy-in, in a sense, to inclusion, that need not be the case.  Friendship does need fostering.  Your colleagues mentioned that in one of the earlier questions: it is no good going to school if you have no friends.  Everybody has a responsibility in making that happen, because it does not necessarily happen naturally.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-weight:bold"> Wapling</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I can just add very quickly to that.  Again, a little bit of research that we did specifically asked disabled children about their experiences of bullying, and there were lots of experiences of bullying from both special schools and mainstream schools.  There is an issue, a lot of which has to do with teachers not being aware of what is happening and seemingly condoning the bullying that is happening.  One of the issues is definitely about making sure that there is an awareness of bullying among teachers and that they can deal with it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt"> One final question on a different topic: multilateral agencies.  Much of DFID’s budget is spent through multilaterals.  Have you formed a view of how successfully key multilaterals include disabled people in their work, and how could DFID best encourage them to give disability a higher profile?  Should this, perhaps, be a condition of funding, which Ms Wapling mentioned a short time ago?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Bob McMullan</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: DFID really has a critical role to play.  They are a major funder of many of these international UN agencies and international financial institutions.  Some of them try but, in my view, none of them have really got the disability-inclusive message comprehensively yet.  Some of them have had terrific disability advisers.  I was dealing with it more directly with a very good person at the World Bank, who was doing good work.  I am not saying that nothing is happening; that would be totally unfair.  However, I do not think that, comprehensively, any of the agencies, when I dealt with them—and I am two or three years out of date with this—had what I thought was a comprehensive view about disability-inclusive development.  There were a couple of exceptions, and UNICEF was the closest.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">A big role for DFID is advocacy generally in the UN system—someone mentioned earlier post 2015; not just that but that most immediately—and in international financial institutions and other bilateral agencies.  Someone also mentioned what they do through the Disability Rights Fund.  That combination of things is a very important aspect of where DFID, because of its scale, could be very significant.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Miles</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Can I just link that to a point that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Lorraine</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> was making?  Maybe we need to re</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">-</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">emphasise that, and I do not know whether the multilaterals, through DFID’s influence, could influence this.  Disabled children do tend to be managed by social-welfare ministries and other names as such, and are not seen as part of education.  That was the case in this country: children with intellectual impairments were under Health until 1970, and it was only when all disabled children’s education was seen as the responsibility of the Ministry of Education that things really changed.  That sounds a small thing</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> but it is a major institutional and organisational issue that could, through some of these agencies’ influence, bring about a very big change in how disability is seen, in educational terms anyway.  I will leave that question to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Lorraine</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lorraine</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold"> Wapling</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: When I was doing my interviews for the AusAID review, I was in contact with the multilateral partners that had specifically a disability element to their partnership.  All of them said how much they appreciated that focus from AusAID, because—it is the same argument—it gave them the opportunity to push the information with their own agency.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">If someone as big as DFID says, “You have to have something linked to disability, you have to report on it and it has to be reportable,” so it has to be something that they are held accountable to, you put that in and they have to do something about it.  There are people within these agencies who are desperate for those kinds of conditions to be added, because it would enable them to work within their own agencies to improve things.  I have requests saying, “If there could be more conditionality linked with disability, we would be really happy.”</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">Salamanca</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> this year.  </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Salamanca</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> was the big moment internationally, where inclusive education was announced as the way forward through UNESCO.  At that time, there was a disability champion in UNESCO, which is not the case anymore.  There are people in UNICEF who are disability champions, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">and great things are happening, but there is a great danger that it is not institutionalised or established.  This is a great opportunity today to contribute to that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt"> Thank you very much indeed.  It has been a long but useful session.  Both panels have given us a lot of insight and a lot to think of on the first time that we engaged on this.  What I would say to you is that, if you have any reflections after this—anything you can add or reinforce—or any additional information that you want to draw to our attention, please do so, because we are really at the start of this process.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We take the point that we want DFID to do better—I think they have said they want to, but we have to help them to do it—and, through DFID, to ensure that they encourage others to do so.  It is also good to hear that we can learn from other development agencies, like the Australian one.  I hope that, whatever else happens with AusAID, as was, it does not abandon what it has achieved.  It is always a shame that, when there is a change of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;
