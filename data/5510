Colleges cater to a much more diverse student population often with a greater need for educational support. It is our view that the Ofsted Inspection methodology continues to overly focus on qualification success. The over-prioritisation of qualification success fails to r</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ecognise moderate achievements b</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">y learners. Whilst colleges do their utmost to provide the most appropriate opportunities for their learners, the punitive nature of Ofsted inspection methodology provides perverse incentives for colleges to attempt to boost their success rates by placing learners on courses that do not stretch learners, or by not recruiting learners who may have </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">a </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">further</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> distance</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> to travel on their learning journey. This includes learners who have not been in employment, education or training and learners, learners from low participation backgrounds and learners who have special educational needs and/or disabilities – the very learners that further education colleges are adept at supporting.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="background-color:#ffffff; font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Each year, some 50% of learners do not achieve a grade C or above in English and maths, the majority of these learners go on to study at a college. In 2011/12, 40% of learners who took a GCSE in mathematics often as a repeat attained a grade C or above and the corresponding figure for GCSE English was 33%.  This is a feat to be commended, particularly as colleges are only just receiving the resources to attract English and maths teachers.  </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The bursaries offered for specialist maths and English FE teachers, while very welcome, may not increase the supply to the levels needed because they are only available by a pre-service training route. Furthermore, the more attractive salaries and terms and conditions of service available in the school sector support the sector to neither retain nor attract suitably qualified professionals.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><br style="page-break-before:always; clear:both" /></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Funding</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">As we detailed last year, the dedication, commitment and good will of teachers and lecturers in the further education sector has limited the impact of severe funding cuts to the sector, however this balance is now at significant risk. Learners, staff and their institutions are plagued with course closures, staff redundancies and contracting provision. The announcement that further education funding for 18-year-olds will be reduced by 17.5 per cent from September 2014 is a further blow to the sector’s ability to effectively support the very learners it is adept at supporting. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The Ofsted inspection methodology continues to expect better outcomes despite the infrastructure for learners being decimated.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Offender learning</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Good teaching, training and assessment are essential to effective learning. Teaching in prisons is a particularly challenging task requiring specialist skills and experience. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">O</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ur concerns about an over-emphasis on qualificati</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">on are unfortunately confirmed in the prison education sector where our members report that they are pressed to provide a series of short, low level course that are likely to secure high success rates, but do not do anything to provide real progression for learners.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The policy and funding regulations set up an environment which does no</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">t support excellence and the Ofsted judgments reflect this.  </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">There is an over-reliance on the use of casualised employed staff, such as part-time hourly paid and a neglect of</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> serious workforce development. As such, t</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">he system relies on – and sometimes exploits – the dedication of teachers to their students and their belief in the importance of the work that they do. UCU has also seen aggressive attacks by both private and college providers on the pay and conditions of service of our members working in prisons. This is not a recipe for maintaining a high quality, professional workforce and for attracting new able teachers into this specialism. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The uncertainty built into the system by the contract re-tendering process militates against the establishment of a stable employment environment in which expertise can be built up and retained, and in which staff can feel that they have career progression opportunities within prison education and training. UCU would like to see workforce development built into provider contracts and rigorously policed through a compliance regime with real teeth. This should include a requirement both to encourage tutors to undertake continuous professional development, but also to ensure that CPD appropriate to their work is available to them. This is simply not happening at the moment. Our forthcoming report </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Prison Education: professionalism against the odds </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">reports the findings of research carried out by UCU </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">and the Institute of Education </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">on prison educators</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">’</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> views on professionalism and practice in the sector.  Respondents detailed how the prison education policy is having a negative impact on the overall quality of education. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Employer responsiveness</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The Ofsted report is also critical of colleges’ responsiveness to local employment needs. Colleges are slowly joining Local Enterprise Partnership boards, however, LEPs abilities to accurately determine and skills priorities and the number of jobs they are likely to create is highly variable, and so UCU is concerned about the strength of Ofsted’s messaging here.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Apprenticeships and skills</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">UCU agrees that too many inadequate apprenticeships have been offered and support measures to improve quality. Apprenticeships should have education at their heart, with mandatory off-site learning providing the necessary opportunity for critical reflection and joining a community of learners. UCU members teaching apprenticeships need time to reconnect with industry and update their professional skills. Our survey of members for the Commission on Adult Vocational Teaching and Learning showed that the pressures of workload and lack of funding mean that they do not always have the opportunity to do so. Addressing this will improve the quality of teaching and learning and ensure apprentices are receiving the most relevant and up to date training possible.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">January 2014</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
