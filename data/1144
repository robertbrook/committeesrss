It is quite evident that Jersey government is a Feudal criminal regime run for those who have, whilst completely disregarding the wishes and concerns of those who have not. Below is a detailed list of the many problems that I have personally encountered within the system and its operations. Please take note that these instances are extremely well evidenced and documented. I am more than happy to give detailed evidence at any Justice Committee hearing should I be required to do so.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Police issues that must be addressed.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">1.

Perhaps the most alarming point in my evidence is that there is no ability in Jersey (so we are told) to take out a private criminal prosecution against those who have wronged us. I am reminded </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">constantly that the Attorney General is the sole prosecuting authority on the island, if he does not want to prosecute, there is no remedy open to the common man for redress, this is so wrong.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">I shall cut off at this point as I could write reams on this subject.
