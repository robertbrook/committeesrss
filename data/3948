Patients are unable to find these COIs easily or at all. Ultima</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">tely, the GMC has to act because it is a patient safety organisation, and this is a patient safety issue.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><br /><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Ideally, the GMC would be the ideal organization to host a public, searchable list of declarations of COIs. This is because the GMC has annual rereg</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">istration which entails contacting doctors in order for them to pass appraisals each year. The GMC, with its complete list of all doctors is where patients can look us up to ensure that their healthcare practitioner can be trusted and have all the qualific</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">ations they say they do. If, for any reason, this is not possible, the best possible scenario would be for the GMC to share this list of doctors so that others can use them to compile a register of conflicts of interests. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The value of this is to provide a</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> window for the public to look in to make up their own mind about any doctor’s potential COI. As a medical student, I am taught by academics and clinicians, both internally at the university and externally at peripheral hospitals. I have a right to know th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">e conflicts of interest of the people that teach me so I can make up my own mind about the information that they provide to me to make sure the medical education I receive is evidence-based rather than marketing-based.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">This is important because conflicts </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">of interest are potentially harmful. Looking at the pharmaceutical industry, the best available evidence [4] suggests that exposure of doctors to information provided to the pharmaceutical industry results in higher prescribing frequency, higher costs, or </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">lower prescribing quality or have not found significant associations. There is no evidence to suggest any improvement in prescribing.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><br /><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The Ethical Standards in Health and Life Sciences Group have declared intentions [5] to publicly disclose conflicts of i</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">nterest. We know from the group’s history [1] of providing false claims about important matters that pertain to patient safety that we cannot have confidence in their ability to do this. Voluntary COI registration is also not enough as voluntary agreements</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> have a notorious history of failure. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><br /><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">I strongly recommend that the GMC implement a publicly accessible register of all conflicts of interest of all doctors practising in the United Kingdom or provide a list of all doctors currently registered in the Un</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">ited Kingdom so that others can carry out this important work.
