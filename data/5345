Unless we create a specific waste stream for plastic bags it is unlikely that many will end up in a composter. More importantly my understanding about part of the motivation for an exemption was to reduce the impact  / duration of litter in the natural environment. There are tests that could be run in the natural environment, but to date the focus has been on meeting EN 13432 which has little bearing on degradation in the natural environment.

On the bag it claimed to be 100% degradable and said that the process would start in 18 months and be complete after 36 months. After ten years at room temperature (office / home conditions) I am left with literally thousands of tiny pieces of plastic  - microplastic. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The bag appears to have degraded physically by fragmentation, but biodegradation is not apparent. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">It is not clear how long these </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">fragments</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> will persist.

This would need to occur without any pre-treatment, would need to occur in a range of natural habitats and would need to be sufficiently rapid so as to have meaningful benefits in terms of a reduction of litter (aesthetic problems and problems to wildlife). It is this evidence about the biodegradation of plastic bags in the natural environment that is lacking. As an aside I would be concerned</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> if an </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">exemption</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> from the Levy effectively promoted increased usage of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">bags that fragment into powder in the home / office environment, as has occurred with my sample.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Example 2) is approximately 25 years old, it is still intact and functional. It is a conventional bag, of similar thickness to the bags currently described as bags for life, and my understanding is that it would be fully compatible with recycling. Were the bag to be kept for long enough I suspect it would eventually deteriorate into fragments</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> as is the case for Example 1</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">, but this would be physical deterioration rather than biodegradation</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">So to resolve the discrepancies in viewpoints regarding biodegradation one has to define the conditions under which the item needs to biodegrade.

What really interests me is how we use a campaign around plastic bags to stimulate and catalyse greater behaviour change among the public. Is there any evidence that you are aware of what will do that—whether in Italy or anywhere else where this has happened—which has been enough to stimulate a bigger chain reaction of actions? To bring it back to the focus of this particular inquiry, if we have all found it confusing to understand why this is or is not being exempted, do you think there is a risk that, in terms of any public information campaign, it could muddy the waters for that? </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Thompson additional response: </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">This is a key question. I am not aware of published research on how a levy on bags will have a broader effect (see also comments from Matthew Quinn about ‘</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">positive social impact</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">’ in an earlier evidence session). This kind of broader picture it is something I am currently working on with colleagues at Plymouth University.  Logically one would hope that raising awareness about the plastic carrier bag itself, via a levy, will help to stimulate interest in the contents of the bag</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> i.e. the disposable packaging </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">used </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">on the goods carried home in those bags. At present around 30% of all the plastics produced are disposable items, mainly packaging. These items are designed to get goods safely to the consumer and also for marketing. To date less emphasis seems to have been placed on designing for end-of-life. The discussion on plastic bags has been complex, but actually I think it is more </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">clear</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> cut than the decisions that will likely need to be made on packaging in the near future. The principles however are the same: 1) do the job effectively with the minimum material possible</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">, taking account of potential re-usage</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">, 2) use recycled content and 3) design for end-of-life, for example via designing for recyclability. Perha</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">ps some of the income from the L</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">evy could be directed back toward industrial innovation of packaging design to better achi</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">eve these objectives.
