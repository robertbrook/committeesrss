The international community, with the right policy responses, can play a crucial and positive role in supporting Myanmar’s transition to ensure political reform by promoting inclusive governance, downward accountability and democratic principles. Christian Aid believes that DFID, as an important and well respected development partner in Myanmar, can continue to make a significant difference to support inclusive development within the country. In order to achieve this, we believe the following key priorities should form part of DFID’s future strategy and our submission will focus on the following areas:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 10.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Strengthening Civil Society</span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Strengthening Myanmar’s civil society is an urgent priority to overcome the effects of decades of restriction and to enable citizens to become agents of their own development, particularly in light of the general elections which are scheduled to take place in 2015.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 10.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Support Peace Building, Democracy and Development</span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Whilst recognising the huge step forward the country has taken over the past two years, the reality is that reform is still military-led and building peace cannot be achieved rapidly.

In our longer term development work, Christian Aid partners have supported increased access of poor and marginalised groups to basic health services, increased engagement of poor and marginalised groups, especially women in the political reform agenda through peace monitoring committees and awareness raising on issues of governance, human rights and accountability standards. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><br style="page-break-before:always; clear:both" /></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">2.1.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">3</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> Christian Aid recognises DFID’s support, expertise and influence in this area and encourages DFID to continue to lead the donor community to invest in civil society-led interventions and approaches, championing the importance of supporting the emergence of a dynamic civil society within the sector and through multi donor funding mechanisms. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">2.2</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Bilateral aid and technical support should</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">capitalise on the opportunities presented by political reform for promoting inclusive development, accountable governance and democratic principles. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The current potential for reform in Myanmar presents a unique opportunity. Decision-making in some areas is shifting from being the privilege of a small closed circle of military elites to involving a broader spectrum of stakeholders including ethnic representation. The fledgling government requires technical support alongside on-going political pressure at a number of levels to assist it in the reform of its political, economic, financial and social sectors.  DFID is playing an important role in providing such technical support and should continue to do so alongside political pressure, in order to build a more conducive environment for political and economic engagement, to ensure the government is held to account and also to promote a progressive reform agenda with democratisation, pluralism and civil society participation at its core.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">2.3</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Civil society in Myanmar also has potential to play an important role in the reform agenda and the restoration of democracy, and this should be supported and developed.  </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Whilst the international community needs to continue to monitor and hold the government accountable for reform, Christian Aid believes it is civil society who is best placed to influence the reform agenda and ensure that current momentum in political reform is maintained. Historically, CSOs in Myanmar were obliged to restrict their activities mainly to service delivery due to the restrictive environment</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> as well as the denial of basic services provision by the military to its citizens. Decentralisation of government power provides civil society with an important opportunity to engage with government, its delivery of services and the decentralisation reforms, and to ensure citizens’ voices shape the agenda. CSOs need technical support to learn how to influence authorities around consultative and rights-based policymaking, and to hold them accountable on their obligations.  They are also best-placed to enable and educate citizens with regard to their rights.  Support for these processes can help government at all levels to improve capacity, accountability, efficiency, and responsiveness.  DFID is encouraged to channel technical and financial support to </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Myanmar</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> civil society to enable them to fulfil this potential.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">2.4</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Investment in Myanmar civil society is a pathway towards long-term sustainability, but CSO’s need more support to access funding opportunities.  </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The success of Christian Aid support to civil society capacity building can be measured in terms of our partners’ track records in accessing institutional funds directly. An example is Metta Development Foundation’s securing of funds from the Livelihoods and Food Security Trust Fund (LIFT) a multi-donor scheme established in 2009 in Myanmar, with technical support from Christian Aid, which was a major step forward for the organisation. However, according to our partners opportunities for local organisations to access DFID funds have been limited.  It has also been their experience that differential criteria are applied due to the lack of confidence in the capacities and capabilities of local organisations.  This could be remedied by initiating a dialogue with NGOs in advance of issuing calls for proposals in order to better identify needs and priorities, and by making provision for building such capacities so as to enable civil society organisations to compete on a level playing field along with other International NGOs.  However, in the interim, we recognise that until such capacities are built, civil society organisations may not in all instances be able to manage such funds. During this period INGOs can play an important role in mentoring by leading consortiums and acting as accountable grant holders, enabling the building of local skills and capabilities. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Christian Aid</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> believes that DFID not only needs to recognise the critical role of civil society in enabling the voices of the poor to be heard when defining policy but that they also proactively enable the growth of civil society.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">2.5</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> The DFID country plan for Myanmar focuses on four main areas: wealth creation, governance and security, health, education and humanitarian. While these areas are largely in line with Christian Aid’s own priorities, Christian Aid’s experience globally is that these ambitions will not be met without the emergence of a dynamic civil society, a prerequisite for transformative change. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><h1 style="margin:0pt; page-break-after:avoid; page-break-inside:avoid; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">3</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Initiatives to support Peace B</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">uilding, Democracy and Development</span></h1><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">3.1</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">DFID’s commitment to funding for refugee assistance remains important</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">.   DFID’s support for The Border Consortium’s (TBC’s) food, shelter and capacity building assistance in the refugee camps of Thailand has been critical in maintaining access to asylum. A recent increase in DFID funding was an important contribution to the process of building preparedness for the potential return and reintegration of refugees. While there is general agreement that the conditions in South East Myanmar are not yet conducive to the return of refugees, an overall reduction in international support for refugees is also increasingly apparent. Christian Aid calls on DFID to provide leadership within the donor community to support continued investment for refugee assistance programmes. As the peace process deepens, and with political dialogue about transitional governance arrangements eagerly anticipated, maintaining assistance levels is essential to provide the environment for refugees to be an active part of defining their own return and reintegration. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">3.2</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">C</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">hristian </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">A</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">id</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold"> believes that working within Myanmar</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">,</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold"> as well as cross-border from Thailand</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">,</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">should remain </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">a key strategy</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">.  DFID’s support for civil society organisations based along the Thailand-Myanmar border has facilitated vital and life-saving assistance for conflict-affected communities in contested areas that could not previously be accessed and remain difficult to reach from Yangon. Given that only a few other governments have supported such border-based assistance, DFID is in a unique position to ensure that new opportunities for international agencies build on existing local capacities. This has potential implications not only for responding to critical humanitarian needs, but also in terms of building confidence in the conflict transformation and peace-building process.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">3.3 Christian Aid strongly recommends that</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">DFID ensures that ethnic communities are consulted, and can participate in an informed way with equal status in the development of strategies for peace. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Over the past 2 years the Thein Sein government has negotiated cease-fire agreements with a number of the ethnic non-state armed actors.

The planned construction of dams on the Salween River in Shan State, Kayah State and Karen State from Chinese, Thai and Myanmar corporations is obstructing the peace negotiations between the KNU and the Myanmar Army</span><a name="_ftnref2"></a><a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">. Increased militarization by the Myanmar Army at the dam site and their neglect for the concerns of affected communities have heightened military tensions, with large scale displacement of  people in areas adjacent to the dam site, as well as human rights abuses such forced labour, illegal taxation and rape. A recent report highlights that good governance is key to ensuring new economic opportunities improve lives for all, rather than contribute to greater marginalisation of poor communities</span><a name="_ftnref3"></a><a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">. The UK government with DFID leadership could play an important role in supporting the development of the private sector and entrepreneurs in Myanmar, advocating for responsible and ethical investment and linking them to UK investment. In addition, DFID should ensure any UK investment in Myanmar is bound by these same standards and works in favour of the poor and marginalised.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">5.   Funding </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">M</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">odalities</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">5.1 Christian Aid maintains that bi-lateral funding and support still remains relevant in the Myanmar context.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">  The shift away from bi-lateral funding towards more multi donor funding bodies poses various challenges.  While more money is made available through these schemes, they currently do not provide the same level of flexibility afforded by DFID’s bilateral funding. The 3MDG fund for example, focuses on vertical approaches to addressing diseases which evidence suggests does not produce as good an outcome as a holistic and integrated response to community health based on community need. Evidence suggests this approach is both less effective in terms of health outcomes and less efficient in terms of funding and value for money. In addition these funding streams focus solely on health outcomes, rather than a more nuanced approach which ensures service delivery interventions as an entry point to wider peace building discussions and initiatives. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">5.2 Christian Aid believes DFID should influence multi donor funds to be more flexible and creative in the way they allocate funding.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Existing multi donor mechanisms often compromise policy positions and impose certain restrictions, such as registration, as a requirement for applicants, thus excluding the excellent existing cross border work that DFID currently supports. This type of work, as highlighted earlier in this submission, has an essential role in bringing different actors together to discuss ways forward for the development of an integrated health system – thus a great example of how service delivery interventions can support groups to coalesce around an issue as a wider peace building strategy. Finally, DFID should use its influence to ensure that multi donor funding schemes to which it subscribes do not exclude support to proven successful development initiatives, enable greater flexibility and opportunities to be creative.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">October 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:center"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div><hr style="width:33%; height:1px; text-align:left" /><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn1"></a><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt"> </span><a href="http://www.irrawaddy.org/archives/34427"><span style="color:#0000ff; font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt; text-decoration:underline">http://www.irrawaddy.org/archives/34427</span></a></p><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn2"></a><a href="#_ftnref2">[2]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt"> Salween Watch, 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn3"></a><a href="#_ftnref3">[3]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt"> http://www.tni.org/briefing/developing-disparity</span></p></body></html>
