Friends of the Earth is concerned that many of the provisions of the draft Bill are not compatible with the UK’s environmental and social goals, in particular the UK Government’s Sustainable Development Strategy which emphasises the need to “make care for the environment an integral part of policy from the start, rather than dealing with the consequences of neglect down the line”. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">2.

We are also concerned that the necessary cross-departmental approach has not been taken leading to an incompatibility between the draft Bill and both the Coalition’s overall programme for Government and more specific Government policies such as the Community Energy Strategy. We expand on this further below.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">4. As we have previously highlighted in our consultation response regarding the proposed growth duty dated 19 April 2013, we are concerned that the Government risks undermining public legitimacy and raising huge public concern by watering down the public interest duties of regulators. Our society and environmental safety depend upon regulators which prioritise these issues and ensure that their statutory duties are met. Public trust depends upon knowing that a </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">regulator</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> has the best interests of the public as a whole at heart.

We consider that the new power introduced by the draft Bill is therefore already sufficiently provided for in the LRRA. It is not clear how these powers could, or would, be differentiated. Duplication of this power in the draft Bill will only lead to confusion, misapplication and increased (rather than reduced) red tape.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">8. The LRRA also s</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">ets out </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">necessary “preconditions”</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> that must be </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">met</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> before a Legislative Reform Order i</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">s made. Such preconditions include proportionality, striking a fair balance between public interest and persons adversely affected, not removing any necessary protection and not </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">prevent</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">ing</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> any person from continuing to exercise any right or freedom which that person might reasonably expect to continue to exercise</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">. In addition, t</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">he consultation duty set out in the LRRA is much more proportionate and reasonable</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> than the draft Bill and includes a duty to consult with representative organisations, statutory bodies, relevant law commissions and such other persons considered appropriate. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">9.

There are no preconditions or tests that need to be met before an Order is made. The consultation requirements are also narrower and are significantly weakened by the inclusion of the caveat “in such cases as the Minister considers appropriate”. It should also be noted that there is no requirement included in Clauses 50 to 57 for any consideration made by the Minister to be “reasonable” nor is there any explanation of the meaning of “no longer of practical use” which gives the Minister an unacceptably wide discretion for the repeal of existing legislation, undermining the role of Parliament.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">10.

The draft Bill weakens the government’s overall consultation duties by removing specified statutory duties to consult (Clause 47 and Schedule 15). The majority of the consultation requirements to be removed by the draft Bill relate to the environment and greatly reduce participation rights of affected persons, including regulators such as Natural England. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">12. Consultation is a core element of a democratic government and serves as one of the main ways that Government can be held to account for their actions. Consultation contributes to increasing public trust in government and is essential for developing policy and legislation as it provides access to wider sources of information, opinions, potential issues and solutions. The Government risks undermining its legitimacy and triggering public outcry by removing statutory consultation requirements. The statement in Schedule 15 that the Government considers these statutory requirements to consult as “unnecessary” is neither satisfactory nor sufficient to justify this removal.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">13. More specifically, the UK is a party to the Aarhus Convention which binds the UK to provide the public with (amongst other things) a right to participate in decision-making in any proposed activities which may have a significant effect on the environment and/or during the preparation of plans and programmes relating to the environment. The removal of a requirement to consult on the exercise of various powers which relate to the environment directly conflicts with the requirements of the Aarhus Convention. The Aarhus Convention </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">stems from Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration, which opens with the recognition that:  “</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Environmental issues are best handled with participation of all concerned citizens, at the relevant level.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">”</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">14.

At the very least, the draft Bill should include a specific duty to consult with representative organisations, regulators and affected persons (i.e. the public) as a precondition to issuing such SIs, and preferably a hearing or evidence session with MPs.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">18. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; text-decoration:underline">Incompatible with wider government policy</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">: in May 2010 the coalition committed to (</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">i</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">) create a presumption in favour of sustainable development, (ii) protect wildlife and promote green spaces and (iii) maintain existing environmental protections.

In May 2010, the government committed to encouraging community owned renewable-energy schemes in the Coalition Agreement.
