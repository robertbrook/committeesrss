I am not exaggerating to say that if an outsider such as yourself or even a traffic warden were placed in charge of a police division and it was your intention to reduce crime it could be done easily and no one would be the wiser. Governments of all shades are also complicit not wanting to show increase in crime figures. Although I retired some time ago some procedures may have changed but the ethics will not have.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">In the early 1980s the Home office introduced a new rule that anything under £20.00 such as criminal damage or whatever was not to be now considered a crime. In future such matters were to be recorded on a minor report form and filed. Nobody read them after the officer competed the form and it was simply filed and after a time disposed off. That the damage may have been a deliberate and wanton criminal act was irrelevant. I do not know if such a system still applies today but £20 in the early 80s was a lot of money.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">Even this was fiddled. If a car was vandalised to the extent of even £I 00 the CID would simply state that if the person repaired it himself or a smashed window obtained a replacement and did the repair himself he would not have to pay any labour costs. Endless windows were smashed by vandals especially home windows and the cost always estimated by the CID came to less than £20.00. Even if the damage was to a pensioner's window the CID would simply state that she only had to pay for the costs of the glass and arrange for a friend to fit it. That the pensioner was alone was irrelevant.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">If the person was a council tenant then as a rule no crime report would be submitted because as the CID argued that they the occupant are not the injured person as it is the council who suffers the loss and it is up to the council to make a complaint. The council cannot pursue every single case of damage as it means statements have to be taken and attendance at court with the endless delays would make it prohibitively expensive. Unless the council contacted the police it would not be reported as a crime: end of story. Thousands of crime disappeared this way.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">Pinching a tax disc from a car by smashing the window though not prevalent was not unknown and the CID would firstly say that as above that a replacement could be bought for ex number of pounds less of course than £20 from a scrap yard and secondly that there was no evidence that the tax disc had been stolen as it may have simply blown away? As for replacing the window the CID always argued that it could be replaced by the complainant so that there was no expense involved in labour costs.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">Attempted burglaries were like other matters dropped in stages to become not even a reportable offence. If nothing was stolen and even though there was damage over the £20 damage in attempting to gain access to the house the CID would drop the amount of damage and then simply write it off as a minor incident and not even an attempted burglary at all. There were many burglaries in one street at my last address and the residents requested the crime figures. None of the burglaries were recorded even though one of the residents was one of those whose house had been burgled.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">A lot of crimes were not allocated a crime reference number so not recorded at all. It was standard practice to take the initial burglary report but not get a crime reference number especially if they the CID could get away with it; in other words if the householder was a vulnerable person such as a pensioner or unlikely to make an insurance claim. The initial report along with many others was kept in a separate box and if nothing was heard after a few weeks it went in the bin. Assaults are categorized in stages of seriousness in stages and it was always standard practice to drop them down a number of stages until by the time they went to court they were of no substance whatever and more often than not they never went to court.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">If a particular premises as is the norm for instance a school would be systematically targeted especially through the holidays if not as I recall almost on a daily basis for vandalism or burglary that particular school would be allocated a single crime reference number </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:bold">for the whole year. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">No I kid you not. No matter how many burglaries or amounts of damage caused on many separate occasion there was only one crime reference number. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">It </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">is not an exaggeration to say that at that one school there were hundreds of crimes though only one crime referent number for the year.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">This at times simply did not apply to schools only and some shops in particular were systematically targeted by burglars or systematically had their windows smashed. I mean plate glass windows costing even then thousands of pounds and were only ever recorded as a single crime.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">Sexual offences were also dropped from something grave to absolutely nothing. There was also an abhorrence even all those years ago even then to avoid at all costs expanding sexual offences such as when a young girl complained of indecent assault or whatever and may have been from a children's' home and also mentioned involvement in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">'other matters with gangs'. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">I remember to this day the senior CID officer's words </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">'We're not having any of that here' </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">when a young runaway girl reported a catalogue of sexual crimes against her and involvement with gangs. Officers would only deal with what was absolutely necessary and under no circumstances whatever deal with what may be a catalogue of sexual crimes so no further inquiries were made.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">The easiest way to cut crime figures was to get a suspect </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">'to cough'. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">This meant getting him to admit any number of offences for which he had no knowledge whatever. It was not unusual to get a person to admit countless, even hundreds of offences. If my memory serves me correct I still remember the headlines of the local press when a suspect supposedly admitted more </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">tan</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt"> one thousand offences!</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">You would do well also to look at the detection rate. To even use the word detection conjures up CID sleuths working their magic to rely on local information or informers or brilliant deductions as in Sherlock Holmes; not so. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt; font-style:italic">Did you know for instance </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt; font-style:italic">that if a person</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt; font-style:italic"> is mugged or a house is robbed and the person knew the perpetrator and identified them to the police that that counts as a police detection? </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">I bet not</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">. In</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.5pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">addition say for instance a house was broken into and fingerprints or DNA left that identified the culprit that counts as another detection.

On the other hand if you were a congenital idiot and your face fitted your career was secure. I once stopped and searched a man who aroused my suspicions and found on him a cash bag containing over £720 cash. That was in the early 70s. That day a new officer either a senior officer's son or family friend has started at the station and he was due to spend some time indoors learning various procedures. Officers were grovelling around him.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">When I took the prisoner back to the police station he was taken from me and handed over to this new officer who as reports later stated made a brilliant arrest on his first day even though he had not left the station; and to cap it all in the event won a police commendation. Can't do much better than that can you; a police commendation on your first day. His future was secure. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">It </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">was also not unusual for me to bring a prisoner back and I would be told to resume patrol and the prisoner would be let loose and for all paperwork to disappear.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">Throughout corruption was the norm and quite open but that is another story. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">It </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">is not just the conspiracy of silence that is damaging but the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt; font-style:italic">'conspiracy of custom'. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">Officers start off right but are indoctrinated by the culture and slowly but surely corrupted. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">It </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">was no secret which officers were corrupt in all manner be it drugs or burglaries. For instance if a shop was burgled and the culprits escaped it was not unusual for officers to help themselves. Even if they brought the goods back to the station and divided them out it never raised an eyebrow. Heavy drinking was the norm across the board with officers on duty as officers would visit particular premises who knew they were secure form being raided for whatever reason.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10.5pt">The incestuous nature of the police meant than any officer known to be involved in criminal activities was untouchable. Few officers in fact even expressed any concerns as it had become standard so as not even to be worthy of a mention. I knew one senior officer with a passion for pornographic movies and they would be often shown at the station.
