We have found the onus of making the initial contact with landowners has, at times, been contentious and unpleasant. Moving this responsibility to the surveying authority, who are almost by definition in the middle ground, makes a great deal of sense. Coupled with ability to negotiate suitable diversions at the early stage, this should aid in agreeing a route suitable to all parties.  We are only too well aware that where the historic route is through a busy confined area, very close to a private residence, or through a working farmyard, a DMMO application will cause anxiety to a landowner and can sometimes be considered unreasonable. Being able to discuss a suitable diversion at the initial stage should be helpful to all parties, and this welcome change should reduce the number of objections and cost to landowners of diversions. If correctly managed, the resulting route should be agreed at a local level and with a better understanding between the parties than a decision from the Magistrate’s Court.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">5</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The percentage of “higher rights” in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">South Somerset</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> is under 10%, (for </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Somerset</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> as a whole it is 16% and for the country it is 22%), so it is not surprising that there are a great number of under and un-recorded routes needing to be correctly recorded.  Thus, we as an association will continue to submit DMMO applications, and the backlog will grow.  Unless the law is changed, the process simplified, and the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">resources</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> of the Surveying Authorities increased, there is no incentive for Somerset County Council to process any of our 185 applications for bridleways and restricted byways currently in their “queue”.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">6</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">We do have two serious concerns:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Firstly: Schedule 6, paragraph 2 i</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">n the draft legislation which </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">remov</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">es</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> the “reasonably alleged to subsist”</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> test and so</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">as the document says,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> is </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; text-decoration:underline">raising the threshold at which an authority must make an order.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">  </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">All user groups have difficulty in finding volunteers ready and able to research and</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> prepare DMMO applications; it appears to us that it is not in the spirit of fairness to make the process more onerous and expensive to the user groups.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">7</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Secondly:  whilst we can understand the idea of reducing the burden on the Secretary of State and moving the ability to query the lack of progress in processing applications, the cost of applying to a Magistrate’s Court so many times is far beyond </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">the resources of our association. We are mostly young grandmothers and young families who ride regularly, keep our horses locally, and support the local community and local economy.  We were told, unofficially, that Somerset County Council had no intention of processing our applications for higher rights, and this new legislation offers us no way forward; thus, in this respect, it is not deregulatory.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">8</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Challenging their lack of action in the magistrates court is beyond our resources, and even if we did, the caveat of “ the court will be able to take account of relevant circumstances such as the rate of progress the authority is making with any backlog of applications…”  means that they could be given an long or indefinite extension.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">9</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">There is a very large backlog of DMMO applications in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Somerset</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">. In particular, the 185 applications we submitted between May 2008 and August 2010, none of which have yet been processed.  We are told that Somerset County Council hope to process, on average, 8 applications per year, which indicates that unless the process is simplified, some of these applications will not be processed until the 2030’s.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">10</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">In addition to the 185 applications submitted by our association, there are, even further behind in the backlog, another 56 applications submitted on behalf of the British Horse Society.  The Somerset County Council will not “score” these, and allocate them a place in their queuing system, for another 2 or three years, and so, unless the system is improved, they will not be processed until around 2040.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">11</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">We are also unsure, and decisions may not yet have been taken, on how much, if any, of the proposed changes to the legislation will be retrospective.
