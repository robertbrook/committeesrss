This Regulation was part of a package of Regulations concerned with the FE workforce introduced in September 2007. There were a number of regulations on FE teacher and Principal qualifications, a requirement around the undertaking of Continuous Professional Development by FE teachers and Regulations introducing Qualified Teacher Learning and Skills status (QTLS), and mandatory membership of the then FE professional body, the Institute for Learning (</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">IfL</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">). </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UCU</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> did not oppose the revocation of the Regulations on CPD, QTLS and the end of mandatory membership of </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">IfL</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> 2.2. Some aspects of the 2007 Workforce Regulations proved to be very contentious. The requirement for a certain amount of CPD was not contentious, but had become somewhat redundant as virtually all FE lecturers were undertaking the required amount, (30 hour per year and pro rata for those working part time). </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">2.3. The Regulation around QTLS status was introduced to give equivalency in terms of status between FE lecturers and school teachers. This was needed at the time as schools were increasingly offering vocational courses and qualified FE staff who wished to work in school were seen and paid as unqualified staff, even if they held a FE teaching qualification. The equivalency between QTLS and QTS has also becoming somewhat unnecessary, as in the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">summer of 2012, the Secretary of State for Education announced that academies, free, studio and UTC need no longer employ qualified teachers. The main rationale for QTLS was considerably diminished.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">2.4. Most of the 2007 Workforce Regulations have already been revoked. This was a result of the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Lingfield</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Review Panel on FE workforce professionalism whose final report came out in 2012. The Review was set up as a result of a dispute with </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">IfL</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> and many staff in FE. This arose out of the decision that </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">BIS</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> would no longer pay the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">IfL</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> membership fee for FE teachers. </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">BIS</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> has paid this since 2007 and the introduction of the Workforce Regulations.

The </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Lingfield</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Review produced an interim and a final report in 2012.

The regulations on these issues were revoked following a </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">BIS</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> consultation in 2012. The decision to revoke the Regulation on the requirement for staff to hold a FE teaching qualification was postponed for a year.

The </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Lingfield</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Review criticized the then current FE teaching qualifications, the Award in preparing to teach in the lifelong learning sector (PTLLS), the certificate in teaching in the lifelong learning sector (CTLLS), the Diploma for teaching in the lifelong learning sector (DTLSS) and the specialist diploma for teaching literacy, numeracy and ESOL. </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Lingfield</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> called for a thorough going review of these qualifications to simplify and make them more coherent. The Learning and Skills Improvement Agency were tasked with this review and establishing new simpler qualifications. This they have done and UCU took a prominent part in the consultations on the new qualifications and sat on the LSIS project’s advisory board. We consider the new qualifications to be an improvement on the past qualifications and </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">gives</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> a coherent base for FE teacher education and development.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">4.5. The Regulation requiring the holding </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">of a teaching qualifications</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> provides a very important assurance for the public, taxpayers and students that the lecturers in colleges are qualified to teach. To dismantle this whilst school teaching is a graduate profession does not make sense. There has to be assurance for parents in particular that FE lecturers meet the same standards as school teachers. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">4.6. There is a danger that the reputation of Colleges in the eyes of the public could diminish following any revocation of regulations.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">4.7. The concept of a qualified workforce imposed by regulation is easy for the public and other stakeholders to understand whereas we fear a real reputational risk, both to individual Colleges and the College sector as a whole, if regulations are revoked without anything substantial and clear being put in their place.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">4.8. FE teacher training is essential if FE is to respond positively to the very diverse student body that FE serves. The various OFSTED reports on FE initial teacher training have stated, and this has not been contested by the Sector that FE teachers and trainers need both generic knowledge and skills around delivering learning </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">programmes</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">, and appropriate subject knowledge and skills. Initial teacher training in FE and subsequent teaching and training needs a combination of practical training and relevant theory, as well as experience, so lecturers and trainers are able to deliver high quality teaching and learning.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">4.9.

UCU has supported this development and it may be that the Foundation may well lead the sector in relation to professional qualifications.  However the removal of this Regulation just as the Education and Training Foundation is establishing itself may damage the Foundation’s work to ensure a fully </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">professionalised</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> FE teaching workforce.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">4.11. However with extreme financial stringency in the Sector set to continue until at least 2015, and probably beyond that date, there is a real danger that without a Regulation enforcing a requirement for Sector staff to hold an appropriate teaching qualification, many providers will not support their teachers gaining a FE teaching qualification and recent improvements to teaching and learning may be lost.</span></p><h3 style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:10pt 0pt 0pt; page-break-after:avoid; page-break-inside:avoid"><span style="color:#4f81bd; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">5. The Requirement for the FE Teaching Qualification in relation to Vocational Education and Training </span></h3><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 6pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">5.1. UCU considers there is a particularly strong case for the retention of this Regulation in relation to vocational education and training (VET). VET and FE Colleges’ role in it are particularly important in terms of developing the skills that employers will need for economic recovery. There is a renewed and very welcome focus by Government and the Sector on VET. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">5.2. The recent Report of the Commission on Vocational Teaching and Learning stated that:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 42.75pt 10pt 28.35pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">“Education and training for VET professionals: the evidence we have received makes a strong case for well-trained and well qualified teachers and trainers….Vocational teaching, learning and assessment is a sophisticated professional occupation and demands, therefore, robust initial and continuous development of expertise. It has always been sophisticated, but in the contemporary world, with greater complexity in the workplace, increasing use of technology for teaching and learning, and the need for teachers and trainers to be externally facing to keep their occupational expertise up-to-date, we need a broader concept of what a vocational teaching and learning professional is, whether they work in industry, a college, or with a training provider.</span><a name="_ednref11"></a><a href="#_edn11">[xi]</a></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">5.3. A survey that UCU undertook for this Commission found that UCU members who are vocational teachers valued their initial teaching </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">programme</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> and qualification. It was vital because nearly 72% of the respondents undertook their teaching qualification as an in-service course. This means they had been working in their industry before they became lecturers. Their initial teach training </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">programme</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> was essential for giving them the teaching and pedagogic skills to set alongside their industry skills and knowledge. 25% regarded their initial teacher training was very effective in helping them teach their vocational subject and another 39% felt the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">programme</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> was somewhat effective. </span><a name="_ednref12"></a><a href="#_edn12">[xii]</a></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">5.4. If FE colleges continue to attract highly skilled and knowledgeable people from industry into teaching, there is a great need for such new teachers to undertake a FE teaching qualification to give them the knowledge and skills to teach their subject which would sit alongside their industry skills and professionalism. A requirement for this enforced by Regulation would ensure that this happened.</span></p><h3 style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:10pt 0pt 0pt; page-break-after:avoid; page-break-inside:avoid"><span style="color:#4f81bd; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">6. Regulations on governance and assets</span></h3><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">6.1. UCU notes the proposals in the Draft Deregulation Bill for removing Secretary of State’s power to direct the content of articles of association of designated institutions that are conducted by companies. In line with our general policy, we are concerned that the general move to de-regulate the provider base in Further Education is leaving the sector exposed to poor governance and the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">mis</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">-use of public funds and removes instruments by which governing bodies may be held to account without putting in place other safeguards either of the public interest or those of students.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">6.2 This is no less the case for providers who are companies than it is for incorporated colleges. Indeed as UCU’s own research has shown, the need to embed greater levels of transparency and accountability, as well as building in mechanisms for safeguarding the interests of taxpayers and students is arguably greater for companies which may take a variety of different corporate forms. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">6.3. Similarly, we understand the desire to remove sections 23 to 26 of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 to remove ‘obsolete’ provisions covering the transfer of assets to designated institutions dating back to initial incorporation. However, we are concerned that this leaves the position of designated institutions who change their corporate form or who dissolve themselves and </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">redesignate</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> themselves, unclear. While the positions of </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">corporations</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> that dissolves themselves (through section 27 of the FHEA 1992 as amended in 2011) is clearly set out, it is unclear that designated institutions that may be conducted as </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">companies</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> have to observe any such process. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">6.4. UCU believes that this threatens to institutionalise a two-tier system in which providers which are companies are less regulated and less transparent than those which continue to be corporations, while potentially being just as dependent on recurrent and accumulated public funds.
