As drafted, however, subsection 327(c) would have the unintended effect that the deadline would be the time at which the poll was called for. That is why the subsection has not been commenced so far, and why the Government believe that it should not be commenced, and that subsection 330(6</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">)(</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">c) which makes similar provision for withdrawing authority from a proxy should not be commenced.”</span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; line-height:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 15.86pt; padding-left:2.99pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">It is clear that the rationale for not commencing the sections was that they set the deadline for receipt of the relevant documentation at a point in time which was too close to the taking of the poll.
