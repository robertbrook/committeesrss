To respond to these concerns, in the last 12 months, the CQC has made significant changes to its leadership, policy and inspection practice. On leadership, it has a new Board and executive team to lead the organisation. In April 2013, the CQC published its new three year strategy “</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Raising Standards, Putting People First, Our Strategy for 2013 to 2016</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">”.

In July CQC announced its new inspection regime of 18 Hospitals, and in September 2013, the CQC started the new inspections in four NHS hospitals.

Under the proposals, the Health Secretary will relinquish a range of powers to intervene in the operational decisions of the CQC. This means that the CQC will no longer need to ask for Secretary of State approval to carry out an investigation into a hospital or care home. It will also remove the Secretary of State’s power to direct CQC on the content of its annual report. The government proposes to make amendments to the Health and Social Care Act 2008 that established CQC, via the Care Bill, which is currently being considered by the House of Lords. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">B.

In June 2013, the board’s skill mix and experience was broadened with the appointment of five new non-executive directors who have a wide range of experience between them to help CQC to become a world class regulator of health and social care. The Department believes the new Board now has members with extensive experience in the clinical, public interest and the consumer agenda.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="9" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The CQC Board is working to develop a new culture in its organisation that supports openness, transparency and honesty, and one in which cover-ups will not be tolerated.

As a result of its 2012 staff survey, the CQC commissioned an independent report on bullying and harassment, which was published in July 2013. There is on-going work within the organisation to create an open and transparent culture where staff feel both supported and engaged. Since the 1st October, the Board is 14 strong, and provisions in the current Care Bill will establish the Board as a Unitary Board, with all executive appointments to CQC made by the Non Executives of the Board.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">C.

In July 2013, Professor Sir Mike Richards stared work as the Chief Inspector of Hospitals. Professor Steve Field has been appointed as new Chief Inspector of General Practice, and Andrea Sutcliffe is the first Chief Inspector of Adult Social Care. Both took up post in October 2013, and will similarly spearhead the extension and development of new approaches to monitoring and inspecting standards of care in those sectors. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="11" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The CQC through the Chief Inspectors will engage the public, professionals and providers in developing guidance for all sectors. The Department intends that Chief Inspector positions will be enshrined in law, through the Care Bill currently in the House of Lords. This will place the positions on a permanent footing and ensure that individuals who are appointed to the roles are able to speak up for patients and provide clear judgements about quality of care. As a Unitary Board, the Chair and non-executive directors will appoint executive members to the Board without Secretary of State intervention. The requirement to appoint Chief Inspectors to three of these executive member posts will not alter the governance arrangements of CQC. The</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Chief Inspectors will be accountable to the Chief Executive and the Board, will act under the powers of CQC and will remain employees of the CQC.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">D.

In NHS hospitals, CQC is introducing national teams with specialist expertise to carry out in-depth reviews of hospitals. It will use information and evidence in a more focussed and open way, including listening better to people's views and experiences of care in order to predict and respond more quickly to services that are failing.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="13" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Professor Sir Mike Richards’ first priority as the Chief Inspector of Hospitals is to oversee a radical change to how CQC inspects acute hospitals. On 18 July, he published his early plans for how this will be done together with a list of the first wave of 18 trusts CQC will inspect using the new approach. The list includes six hospitals with higher risk rating, six with a lower risk rating and six other hospitals with a variety of risk points. As the CQC is an independent body it is responsible for designing and implementing this new inspection regime. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Three of these 18 Hospitals will also act as pilots for the new ratings methodology from October 2013. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="14" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The new approach to inspections will involve significantly bigger inspection teams headed up by clinical and other experts that will include trained members of the public. They will spend longer inspecting hospitals and cover every site that delivers acute services and eight key services areas: A&amp;E, maternity, paediatrics, acute mental health and surgical pathways, care for the frail elderly, end of life care and outpatients. Each inspection will start with a listening event to canvas and collate views and experiences of patients, carers and staff. Inspections will be a mixture of announced and unannounced visits and will include inspections in the evenings and weekends. The CQC will use a risk based approach for timing its inspections. High performing </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">organisations will be subject to less frequent inspections, while those which CQC has identified as having concerns, will have frequent visits to seek the required improvements. The new surveillance model being developed by CQC is designed to support inspection by specialist teams, based on identifying lines of enquiry from whatever quantitative and qualitative information suggest about standards of care. Under the new approach CQC also analyses information about providers to decide the timing of inspections so that there is timely follow-up to potential concerns. The Trusts will receive a rating of either outstanding, good, requires improvement and inadequate. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">E.

The Department is working with CQC, Monitor, NHS Trust Development Authority, NHS England and the National Institute for health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) to develop new fundamental standards that all providers should meet. CQC consulted on the principles underpinning these standards over the summer. The Department will consult on the new regulations this Autumn setting out these standards, reflecting the findings of consultation. CQC will consult on new, clearer guidance to providers on the regulations in December. The regulations should come into force from April 2014.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="16" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">It has in the past proved extremely difficult for CQC to prosecute for the poor quality of care even where this has resulted in clear harm for patients. The Department is clear that there should be serious consequences, including prosecution, for providers that allow seriously sub-standard care to occur. The new draft regulations setting out the fundamental standards will also make it possible for CQC to prosecute providers without issuing a warning notice in cases where the standard of care falls below these fundamental levels.</span><br /><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">High quality, compassionate care, delivered in the right setting should be at the heart of every organisation. The right culture and core values of an organisation are key to the delivery of these fundamental standards.

CQC will continue to develop its methodology, engaging with stakeholders and providers, to make the ratings system increasingly sophisticated. The new system is expected to draw on information gathered from inspection and on-going monitoring of other information by CQC. The new system should be more flexible than one that simply provides an annual snapshot.

The Department notes that the Committee remains concerned that the functions of the National Patient Safety Agency and the contract for the National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) were transferred to NHS England in 2012. The patient safety functions of the former NPSA were much wider than the functions that would appropriately sit with the regulator. For example support for learning and improvement are distinct from, although related to and supported by, regulation and assurance. Placing all the former NPSA functions with CQC would not be appropriate. The Department remains of the view that reallocating this work to CQC would be disruptive and not in line with its primary function as a regulator. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="24" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">NHS England currently hold the contract for the NRLS. CQC now have complete access to information on all incidents reported to the NRLS to inform their activities. Furthermore, CQC already monitors compliance with safety alerts such as those issued by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and holds providers to account for decisions on how to act on them. NHS England is developing proposals for a new system of patient safety alerts and CQC is closely involved in that work so as to ensure that CQC’s ability to monitor alerts and compliance with them is strengthened, and that the role of regulation is integrated into an overall approach that encourages and supports both safety improvement and accountability.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">H.

Most providers approach this role with the seriousness that it requires. In a small number of providers, quality has not been given priority. However, one of the key tests of the effectiveness of regulation is how well it tackles significant failure. The Department accepts that in the case of NHS providers, CQC's use of its enforcement powers was not always effective. In some cases, mediocre standards of care persisted, despite regular inspection. To address this we are putting in place a new single failure regime (in the Care Bill) in which CQC, through the new Chief Inspector of Hospitals, will be responsible for assessing the quality of care, and advising on the need for special measures or administration, but the NHS Trust Development Authority and Monitor will oversee improvements. A central feature of the new regime will be that Trusts will have a time limit in which to make improvements. A Trust could eventually be placed into special administration for failure on quality grounds.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold"> </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">K.

In the light of this, the CQC is taking action to strengthen its registration process in line with its strategy for 2013 to 2016.

CQC is using the funding to develop its registration and inspection regime. This includes developing the new rating system and resourcing the new pilot inspections and subsequent development of its methodology role out.
