I will start with a very broad question, to set the scene, looking at the overall aims and objectives of the Government’s open data strategy. There seem to be three overarching objectives that the Government is trying to achieve through the open data strategy: first, to increase accountability; secondly, to improve efficiency of public service; and, thirdly, to promote economic growth. All members of the Committee would entirely support all three objectives, but is it realistic to be pursuing all three? Where there are conflicts between them, as there may be, which one takes priority?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:35.45pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr Hurd:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Thank you very much for inviting us. It is entirely realistic to pursue all three. I would argue that it is extremely necessary, because of the value and the benefits that we think we can unlock in changing the culture of Government from one where effectively information and data was hoarded to one of openness by default. That is what we are trying to achieve, because </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">as the Minister for the Cabinet Office</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has said, we think that open data could be one of the new raw materials of the 21st century, with huge potential, as you say, to deliver all those three benefits. We have got to be ambitious. We are world</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">leading in this area, and I do not think we are in any mood to give up </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">on</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> ambition at this stage. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:35.45pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 35.45pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q133</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Greg Mulholland:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you not feel more accountability, for example, could actually compromise the goal of achieving economic growth? I accept that this is the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">culture that the Government set out to challenge, but the culture of the past, particularly on the economic figures for Governments over many years, has very much been to seek to put in the public domain economic data that is helpful to them rather than necessarily the full picture, even if it contradicts certain policy decisions they may be making. Do you not feel that could lead what you are doing to come into conflict with what Departments are pursing? I would be interested to get Michael’s view. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:35.45pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 49.65pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr Hurd:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Government sits on a lot of data that is potentially very valuable to lots of different people, and therefore the starting principle is that we should get the data out in a form that is accessible and available to everyone, and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">put it out </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">in a way that is machine</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">readable,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> so they are free to use it or reuse in any way they like.

What has changed in the intervening years is that this is a huge emerging market, and there is really no reason why Government should have a monopoly over the use of data or over its potential applications. There has already been a cultural change, and I cannot think of examples where we would be circumscribing ourselves by holding back data. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:35.45pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 35.45pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q136</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Greg Mulholland:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So you and BIS would be perfectly happy with full publication of data, even if it showed that policies being pursued by BIS currently were not succeeding?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:35.45pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 49.65pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Michael Fallon</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We have an independent statistics office in this country; we cannot trespass on their independence.

There are elements of the commercial world that get it and want it and know what to do with it, and specialist businesses that exist to aggregate this data and serve it up in a useful way to other companies; there are other stretches of the economy that are only just getting their heads around it.

The issue touches on some fundamental potential tensions in this process, which we think are eminently manageable. Our position is that data should be open by default, but subject to important caveats, including personal privacy. A number of your witnesses recognised that part of the cultural challenge here is what went on before, with data being lost and tremendous sensitivities around that, but the truth is that anonymisation techniques mean that data can still be released while providing protection to individual citizens. We need to be careful to make sure we are up to speed on the technology there, but those techniques apply. There is some personal data that will never be made open data, though it can be appropriate to share this data across Government or with trusted third parties as long as strict processes and legal frameworks are followed. Our view at the Cabinet Office is that these risks are manageable and we wish to actively </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">manage them.

In a field where the technology moves on and there are lots of very smart people out there, we need to be quite sure that we are absolutely at the front of the curve on that.

The Open Data Initiative itself is about encouraging reuse of existing data; it is not necessarily about providing new data. Let me give you an example. ONS publishes every month the Consumer Price Index, the Retail Price Index and other price indices. It has done so going back to the 1940s. What we now do is publish the underlying data in a form that can be used and reused. It is much more finely aggregated than was previously available. That is a result of the technology and open data. There are other examples like that. The headline statistics were there, but the underlying data in forms that are reusable is what is new. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:35.45pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Mr Watson, do you have anything to add?

It is partly about getting the data out there. It is about encouraging use. It is about standards. For us, this is about making data useful as well as making it available. It is not just about publishing it; it is about publishing it in ways that people can understand. It is about standards. It is about that technical phrase “metadata”; a number does not mean anything on its own. It is about being able to describe the number and know what it represents. It is about skills and capability. For example, one of the things that the Government Statistical Service has done is produce an e</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">learning module that is available to all civil servants about what open data is, what the standards are and how it should be applied. It is about signposting and pointing users to the data that are available. Again, they are not going to be used if people do not know they are there and cannot access them. It is about the context.

They do not all do it in a very timely way. They do not all do it in a completely open way—i.e. the formats are not always completely open; Departments will be at different places in that.

The work that we did to create the census address register was a great catalyst for getting the address players—Royal Mail, Ordnance Survey and local government—to work collaboratively together, and the new addresses we found and the mismatches that we resolved were fed back into those independent address sources and the quality of them all took a big step forwards as a result. As Jil has said, with the work of GeoPlace since, all of the methodologies that we developed, all of the new addresses we found, etc. have fed into this ongoing process of creating a high</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">quality address register. It is fundamental not just for the census or any alternative to a census in the future; it is fundamental as a sampling frame for household surveys and it is fundamental for the emergency services and many other different uses across the public sector, so we strongly support the need for a good</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">quality address list. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:35.45pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 35.45pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q238</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Will the public sector now have to pay Royal Mail for access to the postcode address file?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:35.45pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 49.65pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Glen Watson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: My understanding is that there is a public service mapping agreement that is co</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">ordinated and paid centrally by the Department for Business Innovation and Skills. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 13.65pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> But there is a payment.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 49.65pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Glen Watson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There is a payment associated with that, in order to be able to acquire the necessary address information from Ordnance Survey.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:35.45pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 35.45pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q239</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Did the Government Statistical Service make representations before the postcode address file was included in the Royal Mail sale?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:35.45pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:35.45pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jil Matheson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: No, we did not. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:35.45pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 35.45pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q240</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Did the UK Statistics Authority?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 49.65pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jil Matheson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Our interest is to make sure that the PAF is maintained and is available and accessible to us, of course, but, beyond that, to all users.
