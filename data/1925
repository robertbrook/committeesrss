The introduction of this power was widely welcomed by trade unions and other organisations who have taken employment tribunal claims, as it was an important means of ensuring that similar discriminatory actions by the same employer did not happen again.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Victims of discrimination who win at tribunal tend to leave their place of work. This happens in around 72 per cent of cases. Without the power to make recommendations there is no mechanism to ensure that the same or similar discrimination will not happen again. In cases of equal pay, there will be no mechanism to ensure that other </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">employees</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> who may be suffering from the same inequalities in pay, have their rights addressed without further tribunal cases. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">In 2012 we understand there were 19 cases where Tribunals issued wider recommendations – so this is hardly "inappropriate or excessive recommendations" – which is the government's main reason for shelving this provision.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Tribunals do not make these recommendations without good cause and are a major tool in promoting good practice. To remove this power would be a retrograde step as it means that an employer who has a history of discriminatory practice would be able to continue to act unfairly towards its employees. Not only is this unfair to the employees but it is wasteful and will result in further tribunal cases which is something that the government wishes to avoid.  The </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">government's</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> own statistics reveal that 46 per cent of employers who have been subject to discrimination claim have done nothing to change their practices.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">It is notable that the government has criticised the recommendations because they are "non-binding" and therefore "not having a significant impact on employer behaviour". Rather than remove the recommendation, it would be better to give the recommendations teeth.  It is ironic that the government seeks to criticise the "excessive" nature of recommendations yet at the same time denigrate them for not being fully observed.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Further, the government surely cannot then go on to claim that the repeal of this power will have "no significant impact on any of the protected characteristics" when 46 per cent of employers make no subsequent changes despite having lost a tribunal or when some employers despite having received recommendations to change practices, ignore the advice.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">It is far too early in the life of the Equality Act to repeal this provision. The NUJ believes that the government needs to allow this element of the Act to bed in and to fully examine the impact of the recommendations and to scrutinise patterns of behaviour by bad employers who use weaknesses in the tribunal system as a means of continuing their discriminatory behaviour. Such employers believe that the odd tribunal case lost costs them less than pursuing decent and fair employment practices.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The NUJ believes strongly that there are no "red tape" issues with this provision which so far has been used by Employment Tribunals in a careful and reasonable manner. In 15 of the 19 cases where wider recommendations were issued, for example, the recommendations were based on requirements for training in equality and diversity. In seven cases, respondents were advised to address equality issues generally or to review policies.  This is hardly restricting businesses or tying them up in bureaucratic procedures.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The NUJ believes that the provision to make recommendations is a reasonable response to organisations which have been found wanting in terms of fair and equal employment practices. To repeal the provision will just give a green light to rogue employers to continue to act in a discriminatory manner.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">August 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
