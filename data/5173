I am a keeper of primates in fact I have 12 in total. I have been a keeper for some years now and my collection is private although I do invite the local schools to visit at certain times of the year for educational purposes. As a private keeper they can learn much more from me and have closer interaction then they would have at a zoo or sanctuary. I keep my primates in large enclosures much the same if not better than the sanctuaries or zoos and follow a </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">notorious</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> and correct feeding plan. My monkeys are cared for in every way and I hold all the correct licences with the relevant authorities as well. I have a very helpful and supportive vet too.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">I believe that anyone who wishes to keep these animals should be licensed as this would control and protect the welfare of these animals and ensure they are kept in the correct manor and by people who understand exactly what is required and the amount of time and responsibly that is needed to be a successful keeper. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">If a “Ban” was brought in I feel that it should apply to all not just people like me i.e. the “so called” sanctuary’s that claim they are protecting these animals yet making a living from it. And in much the same case zoos as well.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">There are rules and regulations in place already i.e. DWA licence which addresses all protective measures for the animals but those who are expected to implement it really do not understand it which is very unhelpful to anyone wishing to apply for one. Having had firsthand experience this is something that really needs addressing.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">As a private keeper I have studied what goes on around these large organisations that call themselves sanctuaries or primate rescues and there are two very different types. The first is someone who comes to the assistance of a keeper who faces difficulties in continuing to keep their primates for one reason or another. The sanctuary would offer a </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">perminante</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> home in much the same environment as where the primate may have been kept. IE not on public view and one to one contact.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The other is a commercial business that would take primates in and place them on public view to make money which is so </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">so</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">so</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> wrong. These animals deserve better. And if the committee is being guided this way these </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">sanctuaries’s</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> and rescue centres should be stopped from brining in primates from other countries. E.g. why would anyone wish to “rescue” a primate from their country of origin and bring it here? The UK could not be further from the climate and environment that it would be used too. Perhaps the committee would request the registers kept by these organisations as part of their licence and Bali rules??? This will identify the true picture of just how may primates they “rescue” from inside the UK. I think it will be much lower than the committee is being lead to believe.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">If a “Blanket” licence is introduced it will give people the freedom to keep a primate under the correct conditions and under the watchful eye of the relevant authorities and welfare act thus insuring that they are cared for correctly.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">January 2014 </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Bookman Old Style'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
