So any reform of the BBC must accept</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> a responsibility to future generations not to waste the cultural capital accrued in this institution. However, the BBC was a radical innovation when created and it needs to rediscover its ambition and relevance. In the context of developments in the wider</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> media and other changes in the lives of citizens and communities it must adapt in significant ways. This round of Charter renewal should not rush profound changes - for example the abolition of the licence fee - but it should prepare the ground for that p</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">ossibility in the 2020s.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">1.2 </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">It is worth re-stating how important the BBC is in terms of its prestige around the world. The idea of Britain as a place that is engaged with the world is projected more by the BBC than any other UK policy or institution. It</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> conveys the sense that the UK values fairness, intelligence, humanitarianism and creativity. Its soft power value to UK diplomacy and the associated political and economic gains that flow from that are (almost) priceless. Recent erosion of BBC internation</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">al services budgets was a dangerous risk but the leadership of BBC has responded boldly and imaginatively. The integrated news services are adding quality both to international and domestic output. They are more efficient but have also invested in a range </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">of digital and other services that are expanding their audience reach and improving content quality. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">1.3 </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The ambitious plans for the expansion of BBC’s international news and non-news production and distribution are impressive. Overall, this means that </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">the BBC will still be able to compete in what is a much more competitive global media market with rivals backed by vast state subsidies or commercial revenues. States such as Russia and China are now investing far more in their global channels than the BBC</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> while new media corporations such as Google and Facebook are ever more powerful in controlling the infrastructure and, increasingly, investing in content production. At the same time ‘legacy’ global media corporations such as Comcast, Disney, and Viacom a</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">re more powerful thanks to growth and consolidation. So it is vital that the BBC maintains its scale and reach and expands on to new platforms and networks to sustain its ability to compete in this market place. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">1.4</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">English remains the most important glo</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">bal language and the BBC benefits from that and its unparalleled reputation for quality and impartiality.

At this moment where choice in the global market is accelerating it is vital that the BBC has the resources to build a significant presence with a quality, distinctive offering to secure audience attention and loyalty</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> and to promote both UK creative industries and our socio-political values.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">The BBC’s Content Production</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">2.1 </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Nationally, the BBC needs to prioritise its services. For too long ‘universal’ has meant trying to do everything. Some retreats, for example fr</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">om major live football coverage, have been enforced, but the BBC needs to reconsider what it is doing in a systematic way. This may be partly about channel merger or closures. Could BBC3 and BBC4 work better as one? In an age of on-demand video and search </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">it seems excessive to have so many built channels. The BBC has done an outstanding job of improving the quality of its core mass services. BBC One, for example, has fewer repeats and improved UK content. But in a world where quality mass entertainment is b</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">ecoming ever more dominant in the commercial sphere, the BBC needs to concentrate on the added value of more intelligent, innovative, challenging content.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">2.2 </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Personalisation is the process where new technologies allow much greater choice for the citizen</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> in what, how, when and with whom they consume media. It meets the needs of the public but it also changes the relationship between the BBC and the consumer. I welcome steps such as the playlister, iplayer, BBC store, as well as the BBC apps that allow peo</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">ple to choose how they consume BBC content. The majority of material is still consumed ‘live’ and terrestrial via a TV screen but all the trends are heading in the direction of personalised, mobile and interactive consumption. The BBC will have to invest m</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">ore in relating content to the networked ‘second screen’ environment but it is well-placed to offer a more layered, ‘contextual’ consumption experience. In news, for example, this allows the consumer to use social media and online to supplement their TV or</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> radio experience. This is vital in areas like news where the BBC must be the pioneer of methods that deepen our understanding, provide context for fast-moving events and allow useful public debate around stories.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">2.3 </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The BBC needs to collaborate and com</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">mission externally much more.

The BBC partnership with UCL on its coding research is an excellent example of collaboration with a ‘non-media’ body but this could be ex</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">tended into content production. Many civil society organisations are now media producers. The LSE, for example, has always been a producer of vast amounts of information, expertise and ideas but now, for example, it makes podcasts that are downloaded by mi</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">llions of people monthly. The BBC should be working with these ‘media’ organisations to facilitate -  not to capture - this flow of content. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">2.4</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Take local.

A more networked BBC must accept greater devolution of budgets and decision-making. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">The BBC In The Context Of The Media Market: Size And Financing</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">5.1 </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The overal</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">l scope of the BBC could be reduced but this should not be simply in response to complaints from the private sector.

However, there is still plenty of room for other broadcasters, newspapers and miscellaneous new entrants to provide differentiated digital products.
