One of the first decisions I took was to provide resources to maintain the number of police officers and of police community support officers.  This has enabled the continuation of Safer Neighbourhood Teams (SNTs) who have close links to the local communities they serve. The local officers attend on a quarterly basis the County Council’s Local Community Forums where the public are able to set the local policing priorities which reflect particular local concerns, perhaps anti-social behaviour or speeding  in any particular location. Local officers then give a report on the actions taken and the outcomes of the initiative. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.35pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.35pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">SNTs in Warwickshire have wide public support and the presence of PCSOs in local communities has significantly responded to community concerns about the visibility of the Police and their responsiveness to local concerns.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.35pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> In Warwickshire I have ensured the link between my Office, the SNTs and the Community Forums by the appointment of a ‘Community Safety Ambassador’ for each Forum who act as the Commissioner’s ‘eyes and ears’ in that community working closely with the SNT, local councillors and organisations such as Neighbourhood Watch.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.35pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">I have given significant support to Neighbourhood Watch and have promoted strongly more generally the use of volunteers whether as Police Staff Volunteers, Special Constables, Custody Visitors or my own Community Safety Ambassadors.

The picture that I inherited had all seventeen Police Authority members disappearing along with the Chief Executive, and the Chief Constable needing to be replaced in the summer of 2013. Under the existing ruled the incumbent – Andy Parker – was an interim Chief who, having been both ACC and DCC in Warwickshire, could not under the existing rules be appointed as permanent Chief Constable. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.35pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Stability became a priority. I made it clear during the campaign that I would ask Police Authority members to sit with me in the early days if they were prepared to do so. A very earl decision for me was to appoint the hugely respected Dr Eric Wood as my Deputy. We did not know each other before the campaign and only met briefly during it. Eric’s extensive knowledge of the county and it’s politics, have been invaluable. He, together with treasurer Dave Clarke (who’s knowledge of the county is also comprehensive) enabled me to be introduced to Mark Gore as an interim Chief Executive. Mark’s retirement from</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> January </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">coincided with the vacancy arising in my office and he has done a superb job. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.35pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Together with Martin </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Sur</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">l</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> in Gloucestershire, I commissioned a review of the office requirements we would need, with some common section, and some bespoke to each county individually. The major funding of the review was the redefining of the Policy Officer role to one requiring more self-motivation and pro-activity. Two of the three existing Policy Officers decided not to apply for the new roles. The third is now on maternity leave. I have decided to appoint three new members of staff. The lady on maternity leave will re-join us part time later. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.35pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">I have had to strengthen the office staff. My PA does three days per week term time only. That was clearly insufficient and so I have appointed a full time assistant and a full time apprentice to strengthen the office team. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.35pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Alliance: </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.35pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">In response to the 2012 spending review, the Police Authorities in both Warwickshire and West Mercia decided to propose a Strategic Alliance between the two forces, where each force would retain a Chief Constable and a deputy, but below that there would effectively be one work force. Almost my first announcement after being elected was to give my full support to the alliance so that the ‘blueprint’ for bringing the alliance to function could be perused and implemented. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.35pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">It has been a remarkable success. Our target savings across the forces in excess of £30 million by 2015 are well on track with approximately two-thirds of them having been already achieved. Not only have the savings been achieved but that has happened without compromising front line policing. On the contrary, we have been able to </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">deploy extra resources in priority areas and also pursued an aggressive recruitment policy for Special Constables. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.35pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Governance of the Alliance was under a Joint Steering Group which did an excellent job, but was very operationally focussed. The next stage for the alliance needed to take a broader view and so an Alliance Governance Group has taken over with a greater role for Commissioners and will be considering the medium and long term future – includi</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">ng a possible full merger. Both</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> merger and single leadership have been ruled out before the next round of PCC elections in 2016. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.35pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The PPA Issue: </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.35pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">In thirty-one forces across the country – including Warwickshire and West Mercia – some officers were retired in civilian roles less than thirty days after they had retired after completing 30 years’ service. This was illegal under the protection rules of the Police Pension Scheme and so as a result the individuals incurred huge tax penalties both on their lump sum and on subsequent earnings until they reached the age of 55. This happened before my election, but I took the view that we could not fail to offer assistance to these individuals who had given good service to the public and had made an error in all innocence and could not be accused of acting unreasonably. HMRC were adamant that this was an issue to be dealt with as individuals and not as a group, and that any attempt to settle the tax bill, would require payments to be grossed up. After lengthy discussion and extensive legal advice we have arrived at a satisfactory solution for the three Warwickshire officers involved which HMRC are also happy with. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.35pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Community Engagement: </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.35pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">With over half-a-million residents in Warwickshire it would not be possible for me to engage with them individually. Warwickshire County Council have split the county into 30 Community Forum Areas where quarterly meetings are held. I have attempted to recruit 30 Community Safety Ambassadors to cover those areas, with 26 currently appointed. They have been briefed that they are my eyes and ears around the county so that I have a good communication network embedded in our community. It is their role also to liaise with the 33 Safer Neighbourhood Watch and any other local groups of interest. They receive a very modest payment (less than £1,000 p.a.) and in return are required to send me quarterly reports in their “patch”. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.35pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">In Warwickshire, besides the County Council, there are five district and borough councils. Good working relationships have been established with all of them and all are </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">consultees</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> for the Police and Crime Plan. Warwickshire has four Community Safety Partnerships (CSPs) all of whom are effective and have made significant contributions to our declining crime figures.

I have said that I would like to see that number rise to in excess of 00 by 2016. We already have the higher proportion of Specials in the country but I think we can do even better. The number currently stands at around the 300 mark with a further 50 to join early in 2014. One idea I am keen to pursue is the use of Special Mounted Constables to help deal with rural crime. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.35pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Community Safety Funding: </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.35pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">There wasn’t time to do an analysis of Community Safety Partnerships spending last year, so I just agreed to roll forward the previous year’s expenditure. By commuting some of our reserves I was able to announce an innovation fund, were I asked groups to submit bids for innovative projects where evidence were based to help with community safety. We received bids totalling in excess of £300k of expenditure. I’m happy to be able to run a similar scheme again this year. This is an areas where our partners in local Government have a huge part to play and we will be working ever closer with them. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.35pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Media: </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.35pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">An objective of mine has been to have a sensible relationship with the media – both local and national – and to recognise that they have a job to do. If we have a message, it is that we aren’t into messages, other than openness and honesty. I have declined media training, I try to give interviews when requested and don’t rule in or out of any areas of questioning. We are running a public service and the public have the right to know what we are up to. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.35pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Plebgate: </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">              </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.35pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Unfortunately our local branch of the Police Federation decided to take part in a highly political campaign which was aimed at trying to embarrass Government whip Andrew Mitchell who’s constituency office is in nearby Sutton Coldfield. Federation from Warwickshire, West Mercia and the West Midlands held a meeting with Mr Mitchell which, unbeknown to them was tape recorded. A major issue then blew up about how the three representatives represented that meeting to the media and the tape recording. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.35pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The IPCC were invited to take over the whole investigation into the incident but declined to do co, opting instead for a supervised investigation. The outcome of that investigation – no change of misconduct or gross misconduct for any of the officers clearly angered the IPCC; Deborah Glass who used inflammatory language in challenging the decisions and then heavily implied in a letter to me that she felt senior officers had interfered in the process to get “no case to answer” verdicts. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.35pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The three officers were called to appear before the Home Affairs Select Committee, as were the three Chief Constables. The Chief Constables all offered apologises to Mr Mitchell, but the officers did not. David Shaw, the Chief Constable from West Mercia formed the view that there were sufficient irregularities in the original investigation </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">for there to be a second one, this time wholly conducted </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">buy</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> the IPCC themselves. The other two Chief Constables did not share that view. It is not clear at this stage if a second investigation is legal.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.35pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">National Roles:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.35pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">From an early stage I formed the view that if Commissioners were to have an impact we would need to have a national voice in some form. Three representatives were elected each of the three groups to oversee the formation of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC) and I was one of the three independents chosen. Since then I have been chosen as one of the two independent board members for the APCC and I am currently the lead representative for the independents. I have weekly conference calls with Tony Lloyd – the leader of the Labour Group and the chair of the APCC  - and Sue Graham Bright who leads the Conservative group. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.35pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">My other national role is that I sit of the board of the National Police Air Services (NPAS) as the PCC representative for the Central Region Forces, and together with Julia Mulligan, I liaise with the Special Constabulary nationally. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.35pt;

font-size:12pt">An agenda is set and published on the PCC website.  As well as focussing on force performance and finance, an agenda is set for the meeting e.g. serious and organised crime, and a police manager is required to submit a written report on the subject and provide a verbal briefing to the meeting.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.35pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri;

font-size:12pt">Plans are being made to tender for a new more effective website so that the public have far better access to information.  I have appointed 26 Community Safety Ambassadors.  They are the ‘eyes and ears’ of the Commissioner in the community.  </span><span style="font-family:Calibri;
