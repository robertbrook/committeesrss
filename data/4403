In this case, the information asymmetry is that fund managers have perfect knowledge of the stewardship work that they conduct, while their clients rely on the reporting the fund manager produces. We believe a standard for Stewardship, similar to the ISO14001 standard on environmental management, would represent an important step in addressing this. Such a standard would be for fund managers to use on their marketing material and enable asset managers and intermediaries to easily communicate that their performance on responsible investment and stewardship meets certain standards. This would be useful to asset owners who, in many cases, do not have the time or resources to accurately assess this. This would facilitate greater oversight of asset managers by their asset owners and ultimately better governance of the companies in which they are shareholders. </span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">The Role of the Bank of England</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal">To understand the potential systemic risk that climate</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal">change may pose to the financial</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal">market and how to most effectively manage this risk, the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal">Bank of England should investigate</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal">the impacts of the UK’s exposure to high carbon investment</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal"> and how to manage this threat.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal"> </span></p><p style="margin:12pt 0pt"><span style="color:#333333; font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">T</span><span style="color:#333333; font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">he Financial Policy Committee (FPC)’s mandate is ‘to contribute to the Bank's financial stability objective by identifying, monitoring, and taking action to remove or reduce, systemic risks with a view to protecting and enhancing the resilience of the UK financial system'.  It therefore has a clear remit to investigate how Britain's exposure to polluting and environmentally damaging investments might pose a systemic risk to the UK financial system and prospects for long term economic growth.</span></p><p style="margin:12pt 0pt"><span style="color:#333333; font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">As this inquiry has already demonstrated, Britain's collective financial exposure to high carbon and environmentally unsustainable investments could become a major problem as we approach environmental limits.
