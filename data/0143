The answer to this question is a resounding no.  The level of investment in R&amp;D within the UK as a whole is pitiful.  There is no robust forensic research strategy within RCUK and much research that purports to operate under the ‘forensic’ banner is substandard.  </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">My</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> research funding (currently around 5 million Euros) is all EU based or </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">I have emergent research which is classified </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">as ‘unfunded’ which is frowned upon by the University.  </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The costs for this are subsidised through my income from casework through the grace that the University gives me to do so.  This is not a common picture for many academics.  </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">There is no governmental support and there is </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">limited</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> provider support in this area.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">  Compared to the current US investment in forensic science the UK is unquestionably falling very far behind on the global market.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">2.

I admit to being aware of no effect on R&amp;D as the level of investment has always been low.  I have of late been very conscious of some very poor standard procedural and analytical work with some providers but whether this can be laid at the door of the FSS closure is not clear. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">4.

Yes I do think this has happened.  There are several practitioners who have either gone into early retirement or moved abroad – Australia seems to be popular.  Some have unquestionably been retained within UK organisations and so I think this diaspora has been mixed.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">8.
