font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Good morning. This is the first session of the Committee’s inquiry into women and sport. I would like to welcome Tim Woodhouse, the Head of Policy at Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">May I begin by asking you what you see as the barriers? When we started looking at this, we thought that the barriers would be about finance and facilities, but the study that Sport England has conducted flags up rather non-sporting barriers: things such as lifestyle, reluctance to spend time away from the children, social issues and also self-image. Do you agree that they are the principal obstacles and, if so, is there anything you can do about it?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Tim Woodhouse</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Good morning, and thank you very much for inviting me to appear today. Obviously this is a topic that is dear to our heart, so we thank you for hosting the inquiry and giving us the opportunity to contribute.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I think the Sport England research is very valuable and, in fact, I think we probably did it in partnership with them—it has probably taken some of that evidence from our fact sheet. We work alongside Sport England, so we do agree that those are some of the barriers that present some of the problems that women in sport face. I think we can categorise the problems into two areas. I suppose there are some supply-side problems—ensuring that the supply of sport and physical activity is delivered in the right ways to ensure that women and girls take part and have a good time taking part. Then there are also some demand-side barriers, where women and girls need to be encouraged to take part, and they are some of the sociological and cultural barriers that you suggested. But, fundamentally, it is a complex problem with a number of different barriers, so I think the solutions also have to be complex and to take account of a number of different factors and features.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q2 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Given the barriers that exist, do you think it might be more effective to deal with this as a health problem and to try to educate people about the need to take exercise, rather than necessarily to play sport?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Tim Woodhouse</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: No, I do not think we should just focus on the health side. I think we have seen a number of good examples whereby sports have designed programmes effectively with female participants in mind. When they can tailor their products, target them effectively, market them and engage women and girls to want to take part, I think we have seen both short-term and sustained increases in participation. An initiative such as England Netball’s Back to Netball campaign is a very good one that has produced sustainable change. Other sports have seen increases, such as women’s boxing, table tennis and rowing. I know you are hearing from Streetgames later on. It is very effective, too, in engaging certain groups of young women in sport. We have also seen new sports, such as roller derby, coming on to the scene. So I think that sport can deliver for women, but it needs to be tailored and marketed in the right way.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That is not to say that we shouldn’t also be approaching it as a health issue. For many women, traditional sports are not going to be the answer, so we do need also to provide alternatives, whether that is funded through the Department of Health, or local authorities and health and wellbeing boards. There are a number of different policy answers, and I think it is a complex problem with many different potential solutions.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q3 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Angie Bray:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Can I ask you about swimming in particular? I have a very active charitable organisation in my constituency that is doing a lot of promotion around swimming, particularly within some communities where the idea of shared public facilities is a problem culturally. But the point about swimming is not only that it is great exercise, but that it is also a life saver if you know how to swim. I think there are some quite alarming figures about the fact that, because there isn’t such a push for swimming as a sport these days, the numbers of drownings have actually gone up, so I wonder what can be done to push swimming particularly.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Tim Woodhouse</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: In terms of swimming for life saving, it obviously is a much broader issue than just women and girls. I think it is one of the few sports that is still on the national curriculum, and I know—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q4 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Angie Bray:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It is not being pushed as aggressively as it should be, I think, in some schools.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Tim Woodhouse</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I will certainly have a look and then come back to you and see if there is an issue. Certainly swimming is so dependent on local authority provision in most circumstances. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The governing body of Amateur Swimming Association can do a good job in trying to market it more effectively at women and girls. It is often down to the quality of the facilities at a local level and ensuring that they are maintained well and cleaned regularly. We know it is a big issue for women and girls if changing rooms are dirty. It is going to be an off-putting experience and they are unlikely to go back. But I will certainly look into the specifics of the life saving issue.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q5 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jim Sheridan:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Is there any particular group of women you find it difficult to get involved in participative sport, and is there a converse of people who are very receptive?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Tim Woodhouse</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There are a couple of groups of women that, either through cultural or practical barriers, are harder to engage than others, so Muslim women and women with disabilities have bigger barriers to their participation than others. We and the sports sector generally need to make a wider and stronger effort in engaging those types of women. In terms of perhaps the sheer scale of numbers, and where the biggest and most concerning problem is, it is among young girls and young women. If we are failing girls and women at school and in the transition into community sport, I think we are just setting ourselves up for a generation of inactive women, with all the consequences to the health service that we know comes from physical inactivity.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q6 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jim Sheridan:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Young Muslim women.  Is that because they are forbidden to get involved in sport?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Tim Woodhouse</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think you also have the Muslim Women’s Sports Foundation coming on after me, so I think its representative will be able to answer that question better. From my point of view, I think there are varying degrees of forbidden. Some families may forbid it and some parts of the Muslim community will not want to see any participation. Other parts of the community will want to see participation under certain conditions, such as when there are no men present.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q7 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jim Sheridan: </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Young women in general, I think you said, are the most difficult. Why is it the most difficult to get them involved in sport? </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">Is it not seen as a sexy thing?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Tim Woodhouse</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think they are the age group that causes most concern, purely because we know from our research that there is a huge problem. At the age of 14, only 12% of girls are participating in sports and exercising enough to benefit their health. That is a really stark warning—for this Government and the wider sector—that something is going wrong in schools. To have only 12% of girls in that age group participating enough is, I think, an issue. When we asked them what their experiences of PE and school sport were, 51% of girls said that it motivated them almost to drop out of physical activity. They were put off physical activity by their experiences of school sport and PE.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q8 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jim Sheridan:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> How does that compare with young boys—teenagers of 14?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Tim Woodhouse</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There is about a 10% difference in participation rates, basically, right from the age of 12 all the way through to adult women and beyond. I think the drop out in participation starts earlier in girls. It happens faster, but continues all the way through into adulthood. Certainly, by the age of 16, when they leave school, girls are only half as likely to meet the recommended physical activity guidelines as boys.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q9 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jim Sheridan:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes. Young males are good at sport and then they discover women. Is it the same with young women when they discover men?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Tim Woodhouse</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think there are a number of cultural barriers that happen throughout a girl’s life. I think the historical understanding had always been that the biggest problem is the teenage years. Our evidence now shows that there are issues even at primary school age, so at eight, nine and 10 girls are already starting to feel disengaged from sport, whether that is because they don’t see women’s sport being reflected in the media, whether it is because their older sisters are dropping out or whether it is because their schools are somehow valuing boys’ sport more. There are a number of different reasons. I think peer pressure is an issue. Certainly, when we get into the early stages of secondary school and beyond, actually even if a girl is innately sporty herself, because she sees her peer group is not participating and because she doesn’t see any women’s sport in the media, she thinks, “Well, perhaps I am slightly odd to want to carry on participating,” so then they drop out as well.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q10 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Conor Burns:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> With the figures and data you were giving us about participation levels and drop off rates, how far back does your evidence go? How recent a phenomenon is this?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Tim Woodhouse</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: In terms of the data that we use now, the Sport England Active People Survey is the most reliable evidence that we have at the moment. That goes back seven years now, I think, but it is a historical problem. We have seen evidence way back from when Committees in the House looked at this issue in the 1950s and 1960s. We already saw a gender gap at that stage and it was raised as an issue. I do not think it has progressed very much since then. To be honest, the historical stubbornness of this problem, and the fact that it exists across all age groups, is one of the reasons why we are saying that now is the time that the Government needs to establish a cross-departmental strategy focusing on women and girls’ participation, combining the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Department of Health and the Department for Education and others, as they see appropriate, to set out some priorities and objectives. That is purely because although we can highlight some great case studies and individual pockets of good practice, we are not seeing the step change that I think we would have all liked to, and now is the time really to put the strategy into place and focus some attention on the issue.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q11 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Conor Burns:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> If your figures are right, this is a failure of schools, and a failure within schools to provide an offering that captures the imagination of young women in the way that sport seems to capture the imagination of young men.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Tim Woodhouse</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I would not want just to single out the schools, but I think the schools have a very important role to play. There are a number of stakeholders we would like to see do things slightly differently, and that is why there is no magic bullet to say, “If schools get it right, suddenly the whole world will change.” I think the schools are one important part of it. In terms of education policy, we have seen there are certainly lots of practical measures that individual schools can take. We have produced toolkits to help individual schools and PE teachers to engage with women and girls.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">At a national policy level, I think that the Government could give some clearer steer around the role of PE in school sport. We believe that the first priority of PE in school sport should be health and, therefore, getting every girl and every boy active. We do think that if you get every girl active, they are also much more likely to engage in competitive sport, which we are </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">also very keen on making improvements in. But if you have health as your starting point, you are much more likely to get girls to progress into competitive sport. If you focus on competitive sport in the first instance, that is when I think you might see girls drop out at a faster rate.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q12 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Conor Burns:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I am interested that you want to create a departmental working group across lots of Government Departments, but that is often a great way of killing off a good initiative. For six or seven years you have had this data. You must have been interfacing with Government—both this one and the previous Government—and making recommendations of what you think they should do to tackle the problem. Could you give us a few examples of those recommendations, and also tell us what the reactions of the previous Government and this Government have been to your lobbying?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Tim Woodhouse</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: As you say, we have been working for a number of years in this area and I think we should not forget that we have come a long way, both in the last couple of decades, but also in the past 10 years. I think that is thanks to parties of both colours and Governments of both colours. For instance, 20 years ago, girls were fighting for the right to play football in primary schools; they are not fighting for that right now. It is there in most schools. There are still problems and the school-community links need fixing. I know Sport England is working hard on that. But, in terms of specific requests from the Government, I hear what you are saying about the potential for a cross-department strategy to go into the long grass, but I do not think it would. I think there is political will on all sides now really to engage in this issue. I think this Committee is a reflection of that kind of cross-party acceptance that this is a major problem that needs addressing.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There are a number of different areas of action. We have already talked extensively about school sport but, in terms of the way the Government invest money into adult participation, we would like to see some changes there.  We would like to see some changes in terms of the whole way the media responds to women’s sport. I know it is hard for the Government to get involved directly in it, but I think they still have some levers. The whole commercial value of women’s sport is an issue and I think we need to encourage companies—commercial brands—to want to engage with women’s sport a lot more. Then the final area I suppose is leadership. We would like to see the governing bodies of sport reflect better the society that they try to serve. The fact that only 20%, 21%, or 22% of board members in sport are currently female, and the fact that six governing bodies have no women at all on their boards, is, I think, an issue. I think the Government have started to take action on that through DCMS and Sport England’s 25% minimum expectation. If we can increase the number of women in leadership roles, through some of the levers of Government investment, I think that will help as well.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q13 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Conor Burns:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you think there is a slight irony in that the head of Policy and External Affairs for Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation is a man?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Tim Woodhouse</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: No, I don’t. Of course I understand the issue and it was raised quite often when I first got this job five years ago, but I think we have enough evidence to back up what we are saying that I do not have to be a woman.

I would be surprised if anybody would disagree with that. What I am a bit more dubious about is this constant obsession that women should be playing whatever men are playing in the same proportions—the sort of equality obsession. Is it just not the case that women are not as interested in sport as men?  Some women are but, on the whole, more men tend to be more interested in sport than women, so inevitably more men will be participating in sport than women? Isn’t that just the situation?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Tim Woodhouse</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: No, I do not think that is the situation. That may be a reflection on how the system is set up at the moment, and you may think that as a result of the wider culture and the media around sport.  I do not think that women are any less interested innately in sport or otherwise.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q15 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Philip Davies:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What evidence do you have to say that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Tim Woodhouse</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: As part of the research that we did with school girls, for example, we asked girls and boys whether they enjoyed competitive sport and whether they felt they were, indeed, competitive. The statistics are remarkably similar. I do not have them immediately to hand, but it was something like 41% or 42% of girls identified themselves as innately competitive sport-wise, with the figure for boys being about 44%. The wider culture that these boys and girls live in and their experiences tend to mean that boys, even if they are not innately competitive, go along with their mates because that is what their mates are doing. They participate in sport and they see it on TV, so they think that is what boys should grow up to be doing. The 40%-odd of girls who feel the same do not see it on TV, do not see their peers doing it and do not see their schools valuing it, so they tend to drop out earlier.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q16 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Philip Davies:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Therefore do you envisage, in effect, forcing women or girls to play sport against their will because it is good for them?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Tim Woodhouse</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: No. I do not think we would ever force anyone to play sport against their will. Going back to your first point in terms of equality, although it is a nice comparison in terms of the male versus female split, we also use the statistics that four out of five women are not active enough to benefit their health. I think that is quite concerning. Forget what the male number is—four out of five women are not active enough to benefit their health, and likewise there is the 12% figure for 14-year-old girls. So I do think there is a social imperative almost to get these women and girls active and, in terms of how we position things as a charity, there are some instances of explicit discrimination in the sports sector that when they exist we challenge on an equality and fairness basis.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">To be honest, we normally do respond to everything through a business case proposal, so our arguments around participation are that women are the biggest space for sports to grow. Our arguments around commercial value are that we think that women’s sport is a commercial value to brands that they are currently missing out on. In terms of leadership, we do not just say that it is an equality issue. We say that there are very real business case benefits for governing bodies to gain by having more women at the top of their organisation. So I think there are some small elements within the sports sector of discrimination that need challenging, but we like to see it as much more of a positive opportunity that is being missed at the moment.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q17 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Philip Davies:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Your contention is that girls and women are just as interested innately in watching and participating in sport as boys and men.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Tim Woodhouse</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: If you are asking me whether we have the evidence to justify that, I do not think we have, so we would have to go away and back it up if that was the issue that you really wanted us to explore. From our work, I do not think we have ever felt the need to explore that particular angle. We understand enough through our research about what women and girls do like about sport, and what the current barriers they face are, so in terms of purely trying to engage girls and women, we think we know enough already. We can always do more and if that is one of the particular angles that you would like us to do some research in, and there are any elements of funding for it, we would be pleased to do so.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q18 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Sutcliffe:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Can I return to Mr Burns’ point about school sport and the issues around it because I do think that is where all the problems exist? I am quite pleased that the Government have put some investment into primary schools in terms of sport, but I think the difficulty is the offer that is made to women and girls, and girls in particular in school. Would the benefits be to offer a wider range of sports? The old stereotype was that if you were a boy you would play football, cricket and rugby, and if you were a girl you would play netball and hockey—and that was it, basically. That was the offer. On the back of the Olympics, the Paralympics and widening support for different sports, should it be that there is a wider range of offer in schools? Is one of the things that prevents that not enough coaches being available, which is why you need a better link between schools and clubs, and why it was a retrograde step when the Government got rid of the school sports partnerships and similar sorts of activities?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Tim Woodhouse</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think you are right on your first point, especially in terms of the broad nature of an offer in schools. If you give the schools the clear message that the first priority of PE and school sport should be health and getting every girl active, but then leave it up to them to decide what works best in their own particular environment and scenario, I think you will see a much broader range of activities offered. One of the single things that we think schools could do very well is just to engage with girls and ask them what they want to do. Giving girls an element of choice I think will also make them feel empowered and more likely to participate. As well as just the choice of activities, there are issues around giving girls the chance to participate in girls-only sessions as well as mixed sessions. Girls-only sessions are a very good way of improving body confidence and self-esteem in some girls. They will not work for all girls, and that is why you need to have the choice of girls-only and mixed sex.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">One of the most important things that schools can do is engage with some of the girls as leaders and almost role models in their own right. If you can get sporty girls, or non-sporty girls who may have done a “Race for Life” 5k or whatever, and celebrate them and try to engage them as leaders of their own peer groups, you have a much better chance of success. I know the Youth Sport Trust, as well as one of our funded schemes working with 25 schools in particular at the moment, are trying to explore how we can identify those individual champions among girls and their peer groups to drive the change that is needed.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q19 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Sutcliffe:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> On the back of the Olympics and the Paralympics and the success that women had in that, I am worried that one of the legacies could be—it has happened in other countries—that the participation rate drops off after those events. What can we do, and what should be the message to politicians and to leaders, to prevent that happening, in terms of women’s involvement?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Tim Woodhouse</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We are still waiting for the full Active People Survey data to come out in December. It will obviously be very interesting to see what has happened to participation rates. Certainly, from our own research—on a much smaller scale, but I think still very valid—we surveyed the parents of girls immediately after the Olympics as to whether the Olympics had had that kind of inspirational effect that we all hoped it had. I know that 36% of those parents said that their daughters had been inspired to participate more. That survey was done two weeks after the games. We have repeated that survey a year on and the figure has dropped slightly, but it is still up at that 24% level. So it is down from 36% to 24%, but that is still a quarter of parents who say their daughters are more active since the games than they were before. I think that is a very good, encouraging statistic.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q20 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Sutcliffe:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It is. You talked earlier about what England Netball did to try to encourage greater participation. Again, do you think that other sports are doing enough, in terms of funding in whole sport plans through Sport England, which is in its second phase now? Do you think enough is happening quickly enough? We talked earlier about facilities and for the right facilities to be in place. Is the pace there?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Tim Woodhouse</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: On Sport England’s whole sport plans, we think that the whole idea about trying to help sports to understand where their current market is, and where their future potential growth areas are or could be, is the right approach. We have definitely seen success stories with England Netball, women’s boxing has also seen a rise, and we have seen certain projects within other governing bodies. No Strings Badminton is also a nice initiative that is proving successful. As a charity, we would like to see people going further, faster. That is why we do think that some explicit Government strategy around this area would be appropriate at this stage—to give some clarity about what is expected from each individual sport, but also other aspects of physical activity in the sport sector, in return for public investment.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q21 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Sutcliffe:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Finally, on the bit you mentioned earlier, I do not understand where we are when we have 52% of the population and there is this lack of sponsorship and of retail involvement in sponsorship. Why is that occurring? Have you spoken to business leaders and others about why they are missing an opportunity for the whole market here of people who would take part?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Tim Woodhouse</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The economic climate is very apparent to anyone looking to invest their money as sponsors or commercial partners to anything. A lot of people are a lot more risk averse now than we think they perhaps should be and, because it is an unknown quantity, almost, large-scale sponsorships of women’s sport is a relative unknown and companies report back to us that they are unsure. They can see the potential, but they are not quite sure if it is there already. What we have seen over the past couple of years are some very good case studies of how it can work, for the rights holder and the sponsor, but also the media company.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There are examples such as the women’s boat race, where the rights holder and the commercial partner to it, Newton Investment Management, have seen a real opportunity to raise the profile of the women’s boat race. They have worked hard with the broadcasters and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Oxford</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and Cambridge Universities to build the product. I think, because of that, they are going to see a return in a couple of years, when it is showcased alongside the men’s race on the same day live on BBC1, which is a great step forward.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We have also seen other examples such as Investec—probably one of the biggest sponsors of sport globally, in terms of deals with the All Blacks and Tottenham Hotspur—which has taken a partnership with England Hockey purely around the women’s side of the game and is already reaping a reward, both through its engagement with some of the elite sportswomen on the team, who are also very good role models and useful ambassadors for Investec, but at the grassroots level to engage with women and girls playing hockey. So we are starting to see companies take those first steps.  As part of the charity’s work, it is our job to showcase those examples to other potential sponsors. We have a report coming out in the new year that will hopefully do just that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q22 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Steve Rotheram:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Following on from Philip Davies’ question, is it not evident that cultural changes affect participation? I will give you an example. In the second world war, women’s football was playing in front of huge crowds of tens of thousands of people.  I certainly know that that was true at Anfield and Goodison. Yet, 30 years ago, there were no organised women’s football leagues in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, and since the emphasis has been put on trying to get young girls to participate, I would say the growth area would be young girls into sport. Conversely, there would be a decline of men’s participation in sport. So the culture needs to change to attract young girls to take up sport and then, of course, it is about retention.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Tim Woodhouse</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: You are right to highlight the examples from history. We know that when the circumstances demand it and women’s sport is given an opportunity to flourish, at a national media level, a pegged spectator level and also at a participation level, it can work. Obviously the FA was responsible for the demise of women’s football at that moment in history. It obviously picked up the women’s game—20 years ago this year I think—and we have seen vast improvements within women’s football that I have highlighted earlier. Girls no longer have to fight for the right to play at school. Again, we would like to see the FA go further, faster, especially at the elite end. In terms of the cultural piece, I think we and the FA could be doing more to make role models out of some of our incredible football players at the elite level. It should not be the case in this day and age that our best female footballers still have to take second jobs. We would like to see the Women’s Super League go fully professional very quickly, and we know the FA has plans for that in place, but we would like to see it go further, faster.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Until you see that kind of cultural piece where women’s football is just a norm on television, one of our lines is that sport is currently male by default. When you see sport in the media, it is by default male, and it is the exception when it is women’s football. We celebrate it, but until it becomes normalised, we are not going to see the cultural change that I think is so vital.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q23 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Steve Rotheram:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> For the record, could you tell us who the current women’s league champions are?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Tim Woodhouse</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I can tell by your accent that you know the answer to this, but you highlight a very good point. Liverpool Ladies won the Women’s Super League for the first time in a number of years, which is great for the women’s game. Women’s football has for too long been dominated by Arsenal Ladies—and I have no problem with Arsenal Ladies—and what sport needs is that element of competition. You need to be unsure as to who the winner is going to be. Although I am not a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> fan, I celebrated the result of that, because I think it is good for the growth of the women’s game.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q24 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Steve Rotheram:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I have to say the next question could be deemed to be slightly contentious, but hopefully it will give you the opportunity to build on the previous answers </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">about widening participation. Apparently women are more likely to take up individual non-competitive, non-club based sports, so wouldn’t it be better to put money into initiatives like Safer Streets, for instance, to help road runners, or traffic calming measures to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">help</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> cyclists, rather than focusing on team sports or club facilities?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Tim Woodhouse</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I do obviously understand your point, but I would not necessarily agree with it, and I would like to make two points. Women may be more likely to take up individual sports, certainly in the first instance before they then go on potentially to participate in team sports, but we should not underestimate the size of women’s football in this country already. If you look at participation by the one-a-month measure, women’s football is the third biggest team sport in this country behind men’s football and men’s cricket.  More women therefore play football every month than men play rugby, so if we are thinking about walking away from women’s team sports because the numbers are not big enough, we should also walk away from men’s rugby and I would not suggest that for one minute.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I think your wider point, though—that we need to look at other initiatives rather than just concentrate on team sports—is absolutely right and we do need to see not only funding, but support for a wide range of sports and physical activities, and to have a look at whether initiatives such as Safer Streets have a role in encouraging women to cycle more. We will have a look at that, but I think the broad answer is that we need to do a lot of different things because women are not all alike.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q25 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Steve Rotheram:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What evidence is there that elite sport does inspire people to participate in sport, rather than just to become spectators of a particular sport?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Tim Woodhouse</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The figures I highlighted earlier, in terms of the Olympic effect, are one such piece of evidence whereby nearly one quarter of girls a year after the games had been inspired by the games to be more active. You have some elements of that direct impact, and we all know the July Wimbledon effect of the tennis tournament. Obviously we need to sustain it. That is where the role of the governing bodies is so important to capture that initial excitement after big, major events such as the Olympics, or </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Wimbledon</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> or the Women’s Super League, with Liverpool Ladies winning, to capture that excitement and give it a structured and supported outlet. I suppose we will see with the Active People figures how many governing bodies have been able to capture the Olympics excitement.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">So there is that direct link, but I think there is another wider cultural point that if girls do not see it on television, they will not feel that sport is for them. There is a very good campaign in America led by Geena Davis called “If girls see it, they can be it”, which goes much wider than just an individual sporting event that they then go out and replicate the next day. It is about that wider cultural point of seeing women’s sport regularly in the newspaper and broadcast media.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">While we are on the media, I would not want to point the blame at TV or newspapers. I think there are roles to play for the wider women’s glossy magazines really to showcase some of the elite women we have representing this country. Until girls grow up seeing women and sportswomen represented in those kinds of media outlets, even though they might be inspired by one particular event, they are not going to feel that sport is really for them.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q26 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Steve Rotheram:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Does watching sport encourage participation, or does participation encourage people to watch more sport?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Tim Woodhouse</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: A good question. I would imagine probably a bit of both. There will be some people who play a sport and therefore get interested in watching it at a high level, but there will also be people who see it on TV and want to go out and copy it. One point I would like to make on this particular inspiration effect is that it is much more powerful for girls and young women than it is for adult women. If we are going to drive participation up among adult women, we cannot rely on just the media point of view. The media is much more powerful in the younger age brackets.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q27 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Steve Rotheram:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Is there any evidence that it is a certain demographic or socio-economic group that is less likely to participate?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Tim Woodhouse</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Socio-economic indicators are very good indicators of participation rates generally. I do not have the figures in front of me, but there is strong evidence to say that the more affluent you are, the more likely you are to participate in sport. I would just like to highlight to the Committee that we are currently completing some research to provide a detailed segmentation of the female market—if we want to call it that—in terms of their attitudes towards sport and activity, and also taking into account indicators such as socio-economic ones. When we have provided this kind of segmentation, we are going to provide some solutions for each of the different segments that we produce. We will be taking those and working with sports providers and Sport England to help the governing bodies understand that their best opportunity is perhaps among a certain group of women, and that certain types of initiatives and marketing programmes are the ones that work best for each group. For another sport, it may be a completely different segment. As I say, we have nearly completed that research and we will be working with Sport England in the future on it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q28 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tracey Crouch:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Just before I ask my questions, may I record that I am listed as a trustee of the WSFF but, unfortunately, due to my commitments here, that will change in the new year?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">One of the downsides of going last is that many of the issues that I wanted to raise have already been asked, but that also gives me the benefit of being able to perhaps pick up on some things that you have said. I am going back to school sport. There is obviously a huge amount of pressure on schools at the moment not just to fit in what is an increasing timetable, but due to finances. Therefore I wonder how you encourage schools themselves to ensure that they are giving girls more sporting opportunities.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Tim Woodhouse</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There is a role for the leadership of the school and then a role for the individual PE teachers who are working with girls on a daily or weekly basis. For the leaders of the school, whether that is the head teacher or school governors, we as a sector need to ensure that they understand the value of being physically active, and not just for health reasons, because there are a number of other benefits. If you can get students to be physically active, they are much more likely to get better academic grades, their behaviour is good and they are less likely to engage in dangerous practices such as drug taking. So it is an issue of advocacy and trying to ensure that the leaders of the school understand the importance of getting girls active. Then, on a practice level, it is working with individual teachers and improving teacher training to ensure that they understand the right ways of getting girls engaged at every level. As I say, the Changing the Game for Girls toolkit is a really good, practical way of ensuring that teachers have the ability to engage with girls. The point was raised earlier that the choice of activities and settings in which they operate, and holding up other girls as role models and peer group leaders in their own right, are some practical ways.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q29 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tracey Crouch:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I notice that you refer in your written evidence to statistics around body image for girls.  Some 75% of girls say that they are concerned about body image and that in itself could act as a deterrent to them participating in school sport. Do you have any suggestions as to what could be done to try to help girls still participate in sport while obviously remaining conscious of their body image?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Tim Woodhouse</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Thankfully, I think we have come a long way in terms of the PE kit that girls are required to wear now. Most schools do not require such skimpy or revealing PE kits as they perhaps used to. I think that barrier has kind of been addressed. In terms of single-sex provision, I think giving girls the option of participating in single-sex sessions is an important opportunity that they should be provided with, but it is also about the choice of activities. There are some activities that girls will be much more willing to engage with because they allow them to feel that their skills are developing and they are not going to be singled out as the worst girl in the room. If there is an element of personal competition that we would like pushed, it is “personal best” as a way of introducing competitive elements to school sport and physical activity—trying to encourage girls to do better than they did last week; to go faster or higher; or to get stronger—and that is a great way of increasing their own self-confidence and thinking, “I can do this. I have already seen that improvement from a month ago. I am going to continue with it.” Once they get that body confidence up, we think that they are much more likely to engage in the more traditional competitive sports.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q30 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tracey Crouch:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What about changing room facilities?

They are not going to encourage new participants, but I think they can discourage existing participants to drop out if they are poorly done. So we do think that single shower cubicles and private individual changing rooms within the larger environment should all feature where possible. We appreciate the financial limits to some schools’ budgets, and that is not always possible, but when it is possible to provide single, individual cubicles, schools should do that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q31 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tracey Crouch:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you think it should be a requirement of new-build schools to provide single changing room environments?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Tim Woodhouse</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Whether it is a requirement or just very strong advice I am not sure—I would have to go away and think about whether there are any downsides to that—but I think it is certainly best practice to ensure that that happens.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q32 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tracey Crouch:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Finally, we have spoken a lot about girls in particular, but one of the fastest growing cohorts of any population is older women, who obviously have increasing health and social care demands.

It is probably one of the areas that the sports sector has provided least attention to over the last few years, and I think I would need to come back to you.

Obviously, Rimla, in your particular case, Jim’s question about the religious requirements of the Muslim faith and whether that impedes women from being to take part, but also, for Streetgames, what you see as the principal barriers for women to participate in sports? Let us start with Streetgames, and then we will come to Rimla.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Karen Keohane</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: At the moment there are lots of barriers around accessibility for women to take part in sports, such as cost and access to facilities.  Just provision being available is the No. 1 barrier. There is a lack of opportunity for women from our communities to get involved in sport because it isn’t available, so we need to make sure it is on people’s doorsteps at the right price, at the right time, in the right style and at the right cost. They are the very obvious barriers relating to access to sport.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Some of the issues are deeper, in that there are lots of perceptions around what sport looks like, which we need to address.  We need to package sport so that it is attractive to women. When we are getting women to take part in sport, we are competing for their time against lots of other activities. We need to package it up to make it meet their motivations so that they feel that they want to be involved in sport. There are lots of barriers and we need to package it up to make it attractive.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rimla Akhtar</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Just to say upfront that although it is the Muslim Women’s Sports Foundation, we work with all women, so we have an understanding of a lot of the barriers that face a lot of women and girls across the country. I would agree with what Karen has just said. The main barriers that we see are generally organisational, so it is about what time the sessions are taking place, where they are taking place and the cost of them. Those kinds of ones can be overcome with a lot of flexibility that can be shown by the organisations that are putting them on.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There is the other side, particularly with BME groups, of cultural attitudes generally towards sport and also understanding.  For example, I am second generation in this country, and the barriers that we had were really around, “We need to get an education first before we think about things like sport”. Those have now gone and passed on and we cannot really talk about those anymore. With the vast majority of barriers, we have a “no excuses” policy at the foundation, so </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">with any excuse that women might come up with to say, “I am not going to play sport because—”, we will get rid of it. We have shown that it can be done, so for me it is generally organisational rather than attitudinal barriers that exist.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think Tracey is going to explore this a little further.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q35 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tracey Crouch:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I could see you nodding your head when I was asking Tim about changing room facilities, in particular.

I can certainly talk from our struggle when we go across the country and try to put on sessions. Because our sessions are in a male environment, they are held indoors, and the vast majority of school halls, and leisure centres, especially, are so open plan that women will not feel comfortable participating in that kind of environment. So changing rooms are certainly one area, but the general design of venues is just not suitable for BME women and girls. For those girls who feel less comfortable playing sports because of body image or any other reason, it is going to be a barrier straightaway.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q36 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tracey Crouch:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You see that across all age groups, do you?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rimla Akhtar</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes, certainly.

The idea was to give them a positive experience of sports so that, when they hit 16, they would be able to come to adult sessions and take part and still have a positive attitude towards sport. In that situation, we found we wanted to work with faith schools, in particular, because we know that often they are the most lacking when it comes to facilities. They do not have sports halls. The vast majority of the time the problem was getting the girls from the school to a venue that was appropriate for them. There is openness and there is a demand for sports within these schools, but the problem is how do we address those demands? At the moment, facilities and the organisation around school sports is just not there.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q38 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tracey Crouch:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> In many respects, when we talk about school sports we have a captive audience.

Our work is a holistic view, so we not only put on sessions of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">basketball, futsal or multi-sports, but we want them to think even about careers in sport. If they have considered becoming a referee or a coach, we want to bring those role models out, as well as working with governing bodies to tailor their own suites of solutions that are appropriate for these women and girls. For us, we know how the community works and we would like to bring sports to the community. Rather than waiting for them to take those 10 steps towards us, we would rather jump towards them and provide them with what they are looking for.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q39 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tracey Crouch:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Karen, I see you nodding your head, is that your—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Karen Keohane</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes. It is a very similar response for targeting the non-sporty girls we might want to engage with. Waiting for them to come to sport is not going to happen, so we need to go and find mother and toddler groups, and youth groups where girls are meeting, and take sport to them packaged up in the way in which they want it and it is attractive to them.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q40 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tracey Crouch:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you think there is enough flexibility within the community for provision of sports at the moment?

The sessions we are talking about are very informal and relaxed, so we do not need grandiose sports centres and sports halls. We need community centres and community halls, and obviously access to them at the right time and the right price, but we just need those spaces in which women feel comfortable. We take sport into those places, and I think our experience shows that that can be done fairly easily with the right attitude and the right skills for the coaches to be able to deliver in those spaces, which are different from your sports halls and football pitches, perhaps.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q41 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tracey Crouch:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you think it would be better for everybody if sport was pitched more as a health issue than a sport issue?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Karen Keohane</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is an interesting one. When we set up the girls’ programme, we very carefully chose our strapline, which was fun, fitness and friends. Fitness is a strong motivation for women, and I think women see fitness contributing to good health. When we talk to young girls, they understand that fit helps being healthy, so I think, sold in that way, health is a lead in, but I think if you sold to young women, “Take part in sport and activity because it is going to stop you having a heart attack when you are 60,” or whatever, that is probably not the motivation. It is very much fitness, but then wrapped round with friends and fun.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rimla Akhtar</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes, I agree with Karen. I think the reasons why women and girls take part in sport are so varied that you cannot just go down one road with this. Health is certainly one issue, and that is one thing that we have started working towards—sort of GP referral work—but ultimately when they are feeling more confident within themselves, they will want to do it for other reasons as well. So we do need a suite of solutions. It cannot just be one reason and one kind of way of marketing it. It needs to be varied, and alongside the attitude being changed.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Karen Keohane</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Sorry, can I just add to that? We find fitness is a good engagement into activity, but then to retain the women week in, week out, you need to tailor your offer so that you introduce more goals and they are seeing improvements, whether that is competition, in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">all different guises. The offer changes as women’s confidence gains, and then we can start moving them into other sport and activities. We find that if you engage young women in the right way, you can almost do anything with them. We had a really nice example of a group of cheerleaders from a project who were so confident as a group and confident in themselves that they went and did a boxing session with Nicola Adams, which was something they would never have done if you had not gone through that progression of building up their confidence.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q42 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Angie Bray:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I wondered if I could explore briefly with you the same question I put to Tim Woodhouse, which was about swimming. It has been brought to my attention by a charity in my constituency that is trying to encourage more swimming and for schools to push swimming a bit harder.  They should be pushing it for the obvious reason that it is a good sport and a very healthy sport, but also because if you can swim, that is quite important because, as I understand it, deaths of young people from drowning, because they are not able to swim, have gone up quite significantly. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:35.45pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">One of the things that was explained to me was that particularly among some of the ethnic communities—the Muslim community would be one—there are cultural problems perhaps with shared facilities and public swimming pools. Do you feel that we should be doing more to find ways of encouraging people to swim and, if necessary, finding ways around the cultural issues? Obviously it is in everybody’s interests to be able to swim.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rimla Akhtar</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes, I would agree with you totally. I think swimming is a really interesting example because it is an individual sport and, as the research has shown, a lot of women and girls do prefer to do individual sports rather than team sports.  I can talk from my own experience in a swimming pool in Finchley. You have women-only sessions taking place and this goes on all across the country, but when you call them up, they will say, “We cannot guarantee that the lifeguard won’t be male.” Now that, in a sense, is a simple example. The Amateur Swimming Association could say, “Well, let’s qualify more female lifeguards, then”, but it does not happen at the moment. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Women generally—I know it is in the Muslim community, the Jewish community and others—would prefer to be in a female environment. It is not particularly to do with just a cultural attitude; it is a personal thing. With that, you can get a simple solution to women being able to swim, taking lessons and having fun in a pool. With these things, there are very simple solutions, as I said. They are very organisation-based, and they are just not being done at the moment. That is the key problem.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Claire Wheeler</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We have an example of a project in Newham where they did a piece of work around training up some more female lifeguards to be able to offer exactly that: female-only swimming sessions involving only female lifeguards. That was through our project. I guess one of the things that we learned very early on in our programme was that there was a very big demand for females wanting to swim, and a lot of that was around accessing swimming lessons as well. Lots of the women and girls who we work with maybe did not have their education in this country, so missed the opportunity to learn to swim at school, which is a really important place to learn to swim, so they are going into adulthood not being able to swim. Again, quite a few of the initiatives that we had were around female-only swimming lessons as well, but access to affordable female-only swimming lessons led by a female instructor in a female environment. In terms of swimming, I think there is a huge demand for it, but we have to do more around it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q43 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Angie Bray:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you think the schools are doing enough to push it?

We had an outdoor pool, so it was going out in the freezing cold in a swimming costume. The memories of that are not so positive.  That did not put me off, but other women and girls will be put off when they are younger. A lot of women and girls who have come over from abroad where swimming is not part of the curriculum, as Claire was saying, will never have even considered doing it. They will actually be scared of the water. I think my mum was in that situation. Like Karen said, I cannot comment on particular curriculum stuff because our work is not specifically with schools. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What I would say in terms of the projects that are going on to bring—and this is across all sports—coaches through or lifeguards through, they need to support and to build confidence, because if someone has just qualified as a lifeguard or coach, they need a support system to push them through, and mentors to push them through, so that they have confidence to carry on within that role. I think one of the key issues that we have is a lack of role models and a lack of mentors to help women progress through the ranks and gain confidence.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q45 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Leech:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Rimla, you just mentioned a lack of role models. How important is media coverage of women in sport to encouraging more participation, and is there any evidence that seeing the likes of Jessica Ennis, Laura Trott or Victoria Pendleton as massively successful at the top of their sport has encouraged more women to go into sports?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rimla Akhtar</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I cannot say anything about the evidence because we have not looked into that directly ourselves, but certainly from the women and girls that we work with, we know that role models are a key thing. In May last year, we held an awards ceremony at Wembley stadium with the FA about highlighting role models, particularly from the Muslim community. One of our key issues is that there is a real lack of diversity in role models. We have often fantastic women who have been at the top of their game or are coming through—the likes of Jessica Ennis, Laura Trott and others—and they will have a positive impact in terms of the image of sport for women.  I think media coverage is really important for that, but we need to recognise is that BME is not one group. There is diversity within BME so, from our perspective, we need fresher faces. We need new faces with real stories and strong stories to tell, and diversity within that. We can create that only by helping and supporting those who are coming through the process, whether that is as a coach or a referee or a player, and even within the administration of various sports. We need to be highlighting those role models and getting more and more diverse faces out there. They might not be elite athletes. They might be people who are really strong in what they do and really dedicated to what they do. I can think of fantastic grassroots coaches, for example, who would be massive role </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">models for women and girls across the country, but their stories do not get out there because they are not interesting enough as someone who is earning lots of money—not so much, actually—winning medals and doing things at the top of their game. There needs to be a balance between the stories that are being put out there and the people who are being put out there.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Karen Keohane</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We also think it is about not so much the Jessica Ennis story, but it being normal to see women playing sport on TV. It should not be, “Gosh, there are women playing football on telly,  but something that is just normal, so it is a normal part of women’s and girls’ lives to look up and see sport being played by women on telly. That is ideally where we would like to get to.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q46 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Leech:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you know anything about the viewing figures for women’s football, for instance? I do not know whether this is true, but I was talking to someone about this only last week and they were saying that the viewing figures are fairly stark that the vast majority of people watching women’s football on TV are men. How do we encourage more women to watch it in the first place and get the bug for playing?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Karen Keohane</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We have done some work with the FA with the National Women’s League, and they run a great festival programme around the league fixtures. They run a great festival in the community to get girls coming to feel part of the football league programme. The FA is doing a lot of work behind the scenes to make women’s football attractive by getting out into the community and getting girls to be part of the matches. That is a journey and it is going to take time to build up the real swell of interest, but I do see movement happening in them getting more engagement around interest in women’s football.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q47 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Leech:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> How important do you think targets are in encouraging participation?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Karen Keohane</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Is that targets set by funding bodies?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Leech:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Government targets for governing bodies to reach participation levels.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Karen Keohane</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I do think they are important. What I think we are saying is that attracting women into sport is not hard; they are not a hard-to-reach group. There is demand from women to take part in sport, so we need to get that quite clear. Women want to play sport, but what is not there is the provision. If there were targets to help to encourage organisations to target those groups, the demand would be there, and then the two things might come together. I think there is a perception in some of the sporting bodies that perhaps women are a hard-to-reach group and you have to do lots of extra stuff to get women. It is just shaping your offer in a different way. They are not a hard-to-reach group; the demand is there, but we need to put the two together.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q48 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Leech:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Is there a danger, though, that if you have targets, governing bodies will try to target the easy-to-reach groups, and perhaps some groups within women will be left to one side? I would be interested to hear Rimla’s view on that—whether or not there is a danger that these targets then just target the people who most likely can be persuaded, and leave other people aside.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rimla Akhtar</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think we often have targets for women in general, and then we have targets for BME, for example. I can think of one example of a leading governing body—I will not </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">name it—that, when I was working with it on increasing participation among BME, it just thought it was easiest to go and pick the men from the BME community. When I asked what it was going to do about the women’s side, it was, “Oh, well, we need to work with those that are already there and engage them within our work, and then we will think about the women.” Often, governing bodies are making the mistakes with the women’s game that they made with the men’s game. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Targets can therefore be quite dangerous, but they are important because governing bodies need to be held to account.  I think targets can be qualitative as well as quantitative, and it is about how you engage with them and with the community, and not necessarily the numbers coming through the door. Often what we have found, certainly in terms of even funding for organisations like ours, is that governing bodies will turn around and go, “Well, if we gave you £1,000, you are telling me you are only going to set up one or two teams, and if I gave £1,000 to someone else, they would set up 20 teams or 30 teams for me”. Often that is the difficulty with governing bodies.  Because they have been set a certain number as a standard they need to hit, they will go for the easier groups. I would agree with you there is that danger there.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q49 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Leech:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What is the solution then? If targets are useful in some way but they can cause problems as well, is there any way around that? You talked about qualitative as well as quantitative, but how would you measure that? How would you measure success with getting half a dozen hard-to-reach young women involved, compared with 60 easy-to-reach young women?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rimla Akhtar</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I have seen examples of governing bodies that have their overall targets in terms of teams, individuals and participation across all areas of their sports, but then within that they all have their own targets in terms of how many, for example, BME people they want across their coaching ranges or their refereeing groups. There is a potential to have KPIs across the board. It does not just need to be at top level. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">For me, when it comes to governing bodies, there needs to be an attitudinal change in terms of understanding that quality comes over quantity. If we want to engage with the most inactive women, we have to be flexible in our approach. It is not about numbers coming through the door. Once we get those few through the door and they are hooked, more will come as a result. There is a need to identify that working with particular groups—BME women and girls—will be different to the overall targets, so there almost needs to be a staggered approach to how we set targets for governing bodies and how we intend to engage with these women and girls. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q50 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jim Sheridan:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Can I ask a perhaps somewhat controversial question, in the sense of individual women’s sexuality in sport?

I do not think it has gone. From my experience, in terms of the equality agenda and working within the equality arena, I can think of football. I go to games and you hear some of the chanting that goes on there. There is still a negative perception of people who are homosexual, and that is </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">something that still needs to be overcome, but that is the extent of my experience of working with sexuality in sport.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q51 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jim Sheridan:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Anything else?

If you can, I would like to know where there is good practice, what works, which sports do quite well, and how we are looking in terms of trying to widen the opportunities. Particularly Streetgames, you have experience of upgrading games in terms of offering different types of a particular sport, but which are the good governing bodies? Which ones are doing good outreach work?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Karen Keohane</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I will start with the very obvious one, which is netball. It is a women’s sport, so in some respects it might be not quite what you are getting at, but I think what netball has shown the other sports is that—because they are working with women, per se, but they have segmented that market into different types of women, because all women are not the same—they have developed different offers for different groups. That is good. That is a governing body understanding its market and designing solutions for that. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In terms of other governing bodies, we have done some encouraging work recently with the Football Association, whereby it recognised the work that we have been doing to package sport and make sport attractive to young women, and it wanted to learn from our experience. We have developed a training course, which we have delivered with the FA, to over 200 staff at the FA who wanted to understand how to shape and develop their products for the future. That is a really good example. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q53 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Sutcliffe:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Just on that point, I think Tracey raised the point—it might have been quite a bit earlier—that there are not enough women running women’s football teams or girls’ football teams. Are you doing anything around that? Is the FA doing anything around that to try to encourage more women to run girls’ teams?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Claire Wheeler</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Quite a lot of the work we do is around upskilling our potential future leaders in those sports, whether that is through coaching qualifications or refereeing qualifications or courses, so yes, absolutely. I think a lot of the work we do do is to find those who have embraced the opportunities they have had through some of our programmes and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">decided that they want to support the next generation or their peers by becoming a leader and doing qualifications and courses. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I think something that Rimla mentioned earlier was really important: ensuring that those young women have access to mentors and other young women in their community who they can talk to about things such as running sessions and setting up clubs.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q54 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Sutcliffe:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I am quite surprised you did not mention cycling as a good sport, because it is always put up as a model of—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Claire Wheeler</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think what cycling is doing is great, and I think certainly its Breeze programme and Cycletta events are good. I guess that with the types of women and girls we work with and some of the barriers they have, if you do not have access to a bike, cycling is never going to be accessible for you. I know that, at some of the Cycletta events, you can hire a bike when you get there, but you still need to be able to ride a bike as well, and I guess those are some of the barriers that are faced.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q55 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Sutcliffe:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You are shaking your head, Rimla.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rimla Akhtar</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I was not shaking my head. I know that they have recognised themselves that they need to work and focus on women’s cycling a little bit more, and there is recognition that the Breeze programme is brilliant, as Claire said, but there is a lot more that can be done. I think the women cyclists who are coming through at the top level are the role models that will encourage more girls at a younger age to take up cycling. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">On your general question of how governing bodies are responding, a lot of them are just at different stages. You have the likes of the FA, which is more focused on because that is the nation’s favourite sport, and you have the likes of rugby. You have netball, for example, the good stuff that is coming out there, as well as the LTA, which is doing some good programmes. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Certainly, I can give examples from the FA in addition to Karen’s work. We have worked with it for four years on a programme called Born to Succeed, which is using futsal to engage with BME women and girls in particular. As I said, the holistic view of qualifying referees and coaches, having volunteers and participants across the game, and keeping them involved, from my perspective and from the foundation’s perspective, it is a long-term view. There is no point in qualifying coaches and then them having nowhere to go to. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What they do have at the FA is a women’s pathway, for example, because often one of the problems is that referees feel intimidated refereeing men’s games, so they will have a women’s pathway where they can referee some of the women’s games. Just yesterday, up at </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Manchester</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">City</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> football club, was Kick It Out’s Raise Your Game event, which was focused on women, and I think about 100 women were mentored throughout that day. That is something that I have been involved in with Kick It Out, and there has been fantastic feedback coming from that. You even have some of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> women’s football team players who are being menteed there by female mentors who are already in the game, because they want to develop this other area. There is a lot of good work going on within football, but there are a lot of other governing bodies that are at just different stages, and whenever we approach them and work with them, it is about finding a solution that works for them. They might be at the infancy stage of working with BME groups or women and girls, and recognising that more diversity is needed.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q56 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Sutcliffe:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think that leads me on to my thoughts that Streetgames got funded directly by Sport </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> because of the success that you were having right up and down the country. Do you think that more funding should come that way—directly to organisations such as yourself, rather than through the governing bodies—to try to pick up some of the things that are missing? I take your point about governing bodies being at different levels, and I have always thought that there needs to be some funding for governing bodies to get their management services up to where they need to to be able to provide some of the things that they say they are going to do in the whole sport plans. Do you think there should be direct funding to organisations like yourself, as Sport England has done with Streetgames?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Karen Keohane</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think it needs to be a mixed portfolio. The governing bodies are part of the mainstream sport, so sport needs the governing bodies to be strong, functioning, diverse, dynamic organisations, and hopefully, by funding organisations such as ourselves, we can work with the governing bodies as well to help them on that journey, through the insight we do, through the training programmes we put together. We can support, we can work together, I guess, but obviously we do need—organisations like ourselves; we are charities—funding to help us do the work to help the governing bodies and to help ourselves in delivering in community sport. I guess, in answer to your question, yes, we do need a mixed funding portfolio where organisations are funded to do different jobs.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q57 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Sutcliffe:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you get enough funding?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rimla Akhtar</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: No.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Sutcliffe:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You’re not going to say yes, but do you think that, if you had more funding, you would be able to do more work and you would make more progress?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rimla Akhtar</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think so. I will be honest with you. Our funding has totally come from the Football Foundation. That has been just for the last four years, and in those four years we have achieved more than a lot of governing bodies have been able to in this particular area of work. That is where we get a lot of support, but funding has been hard to come by, and part of the issue is the lottery-funded money, which I can go into as well. Certainly, I agree with Karen, we need a mixed portfolio. The governing bodies have the expertise in their particular sport. We work as a charity that comes in to help governing bodies adapt their work, to make it more flexible, so that they can be empowered and engaged with the local community and make their sport more reflective of the community within which they work. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I think, from our perspective and in my experience, there is a gap between governing bodies and the actual community, and at the moment that is what we are filling. Because we cannot go out there and deliver all the time—it is just not sustainable—we need local people to be empowered and make that sustainable. In order to bring the governing bodies and communities together, organisations like us must be funded, otherwise we cannot run everything. It cannot be volunteer-led, otherwise you just do not get the same quality. That has been a massive issue for us.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q58 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jim Sheridan:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Chairman, I just have a very small question.

I do not think it will put off any woman who is determined to play sport. In fact, it might even make her more determined to do well, to prove a point to people who think negatively of women’s sport. Certainly the comments were not helpful at all, and I think they were partly reflective of some of the comments that are made in society at the moment towards women’s sport.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Claire Wheeler</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think I would agree. It is just not very helpful, and comments like that made it obvious that that was not the norm. Just by making the comments, you are making out like it was an unusual thing—something that was different and new—but it should never have mattered what gender a referee or assistant referee was. I guess it is a very unhelpful way of raising a topic that did not need to be raised.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Thank you very much.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Witnesses:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lottie Birdsall-Strong</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, footballer, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Joanne Herbertson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, football and cricket coach, and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Christine Anne Wellington</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">MBE</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, triathlon world champion, gave evidence.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q59 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Good morning.

Suffice it to say I found it very late and became a professional athlete aged 30. I was a sporty child. As a child I grew up in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Norfolk</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. If you would like me just to touch on the barriers, I think in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Norfolk</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> they were probably twofold. My school focused very heavily on competitive sport, which appealed to me, but did not appeal to many, so the variety of sports on offer was not extensive. In addition, transport is a huge issue in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Norfolk</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. I was fortunate to have parents who acted like taxis, but that was not the case for many children, so I had access to facilities that may not have been available to others in the village. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Like many children, I did play sport, but I did not take it seriously.  I focused very heavily on my studies, went to university and carried that philosophy through. I gave up sport totally at university. I think, like many adolescents, there were battles for my time. Body image was a huge concern. I did develop an eating disorder, but that did not transcend into trying to improve my own health and fitness. I took up running aged 25, when I was doing my Master’s, and I did it because it was easy to fit into my academic schedule. I could do it independently and there were no quantifiable targets for me, which appealed. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Progressing very quickly, someone recommended that I try a triathlon. The limitations at that point were purely financial. I have always been the sort of person to give things a go, but financial limitations were really preventing me from being able to purchase the equipment that I needed. When I decided to become a professional aged 30, those financial limitations were, I think, the main barriers to becoming a professional athlete. I chose to do Ironman triathlon, which is the most masochistic. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q61 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What exactly does it consist of?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Christine Anne Wellington</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is a 2.4 mile swim and a 112-mile bike ride, finished off with a marathon. The shorter distance triathlon, as many will know, is in the Olympics and secures NGB funding. I receive no NGB funding because my sport is a non-Olympic sport. I had to be entirely self-financed, which was incredibly difficult at that point. I was fortunate to achieve success and could then finance myself, but I would suggest that finance is a huge barrier to many athletes becoming professional athletes. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I would also just like to touch on, if I may, the issue of retirement and equipping athletes effectively post-retirement. I feel very blessed that I had a career before triathlon, so I feel I have a vast array of skills and experiences. I was not just a professional athlete growing up. But I recognise that there are many athletes who are not in my position, and I do not feel that there are the resources invested in enabling athletes to make an effective transition and to effectively utilise their skills once they retire from professional sport to move into a variety of careers that really are very attractive and suitable for retired athletes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q62 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Thank you.

About two years ago I quit my 9-to-5 and decided to plunge all my efforts, energies and time into finding a career in sport. I had done lots of volunteering work since I was about 16, so I started through my FA level 1 and things like that, and then I travelled abroad to go and coach sport. Because I could not find the opportunities here, I went to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">America</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">South Africa</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, and did a few months travelling that direction. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Returning to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, I thought, “No, I am going to give this a good go,” and with the help of the Tony Blair Sports Foundation in the north-east—I am from Northumberland—I got a part-time contract with the Northumberland Cricket Board. Working around that part-time 20 hours’ contract that they kindly gave me, I took on rugby tots coaching, football coaching and cricket coaching, and I do a bit of gymnastics as well, so I am a Jill of all sports and a master of none, unfortunately. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q63 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Specifically women or sport.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Joanne Herbertson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The cricket is specifically women. The cricket is women’s and girls’ coach for Northumberland. With football, I have recently just started with girls within our club, but that is more voluntary, but I do boys’ sport as well. To me, sport is important across boys and girls. We know a nine-year-old is just a nine-year-old, whether they are a boy or a girl, but it does change slightly as we get to teenage years, and there are adaptations that I am seeing within the last few years as I am taking part in a career in it. For example, there is the way we play cricket. Unfortunately, women, due to childcare issues and time, do not have the time to do test cricket as often. We cannot do a Saturday afternoon in the park playing 40 </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">overs, but what I do find is that a lot of women love the indoor Twenty20 sector of it. Yes, I am learning. It has been a fantastic six months at the cricket board so far, and I am thoroughly enjoying the voluntary work that coincides with it across the sport world.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q64 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Thank you.

I played when I was a kid with my dad a lot and my brother, and I got spotted playing on Highbury fields in north </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, and got invited to a trial for the first under-10s team that Arsenal Ladies had. I went along to that and it went very well.  I stayed there until I was 16, and then I went out to the States on a soccer scholarship to play in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">North Carolina</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. I similarly found that the opportunities out there were vastly more attractive than they are here, and it also gave me an opportunity, being quite into my studies, to combine the academic with the athletic in a way that I did not feel like I had the opportunity to here. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I came back from </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">America</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and crammed a lot of A-levels in, and went off to uni. I am now at </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Cambridge</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> doing my Master’s—doing research into sport and gender—and over the summer I did some work for the FA and also the Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q65 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Joanne and Lottie, this Committee did an inquiry a few years ago on women’s football specifically, and one of the recommendations we made, which was supported by all our witnesses, with the single exception of the FA, was on the issue of mixed teams and the age limit at which girls were allowed to still compete with boys. Do you think that is a problem still?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Joanne Herbertson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I do not think it is—sorry, Lottie, I am jumping in.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q66 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It was simply a question of girls reaching a certain age and then finding that there was not any team they could play in any longer, because there was not a girls’ team.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Joanne Herbertson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: That is it. I think it is simply because some girls enjoy playing football no matter where it is. They will play in the park, like Lottie with her dad, brother, and everybody else, but some girls maybe need a friend who goes with them, who are not maybe as confident to play with other boys. You might start with that mixed group early on and then divide it at 12 or 13 and suddenly say to the two or three girls who were in the mixed team that they do not have enough for even a five-a-side team as a girls-only squad”. I am a great believer in having the choice of both.  If you have the opportunity to play with boys, play with boys. Within cricket we do that a lot, and you need to encourage a bit of both, but just make sure the numbers and support are there when you separate the teams.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lottie Birdsall-Strong</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think it is important to remember as well that the better you are, the easier time you are probably going to have. I had some problems and I got some stick, as it were, but I was quite good, so that was pretty helpful. I was playing in the top 1% of the country for my age group while I was growing up, so generally, if I was playing with boys, I would be all right because I was good enough to be all right. But you should not have to be in the elite to be able to participate without getting a hard time, and I think it is the other group—is the big majority who are maybe just a regular sort of standard—who need to be looked after in these discussions. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q67 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Lottie, you have also said, “Football in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is immersed in sexism”. Is that changing at all?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lottie Birdsall-Strong</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think there is a distinction to make. There is football as a wider cultural phenomenon—as a sport, as a business, as a market—and then there is football for children in schools. That is important to keep them separate. It is not to say that one does not necessarily permeate the other, because I think it does, but I think, for discussion’s sake and solution’s sake, it is quite important to remember that they are different things. The one that we have most control over progressing is our schools—our education system. If we are looking at realistic, measurable change, we have to start there. We do have a problem, because we have a nation of children who generally consider sport to be gendered. Sport is sport, and women and girls play it, but we seem to have this thing that there are boys’ sports and girls’ sports. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">This is something in the States that is just so refreshing. When I first got off the plane and went straight to a training session, I turned up at the pitches—fields—and they had a board up with who was training on which pitch, and it said, “Soccer (M)”, “Soccer (W)”, and I just thought, “That is it”. That says so much, because it is not football, and then women’s football as a deviation of football; it is women’s soccer and men’s soccer. That does say a lot, I think, so we need to start in schools—in education—because that is realistically where we have the most chance of moving forward generationally and tackling the cause of the problem, and not necessarily the effect once it is out in a complex world of lots of other competing factors and politics.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q68 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tracey Crouch:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I just wanted to explore a bit further the international experiences that all three of you have had, either with international competitors or working and playing in other countries. What is it that they do that we should be doing? Chrissie, I imagine from a triathlon perceptive you have seen that some fellow female competitors have more support than others in terms of sponsorship. Likewise, there is guys’ support in football. What, in your view, could we learn from your international experiences?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Christine Anne Wellington</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I do not know whether there is necessarily as much you can learn from international experiences, but I do think there is a lot that we can learn from triathlon generally. Triathlon, I feel, is a great example of gender equality. While it is not perfect and there are improvements to be made, I definitely think it can be held up as an example, as Lottie said, of something that is not just segregated into men’s triathlon and even women’s triathlon. It is simply triathlon. As an elite triathlete, I feel I had equal access to races. We race the same. We basically can race the same race, over the same distance, at the same time as the men.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q69 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tracey Crouch:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you earn the same amount of money?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Christine Anne Wellington</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The same prize money, the same commercial opportunities and the same media opportunities. I do not feel I was disadvantaged at all in terms of the opportunities to earn a living from the sport vis-à-vis my male counterparts, or for media opportunities, within the triathlon media specifically. I think there are many factors that have influenced that. Triathlon is a new sport historically. It evolved with women at its heart. It was established in the 1970s, so women were a part of triathlon right from the outset. There are women in the highest leadership positions. The president of the International Triathlon Union is a woman. The vice-president is also a woman. I think that is incredibly important. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There is a great club structure, especially here in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, which offers a cocoon of support. There are women-only races. There are online resources for women as much as men. Clothing is tailored to women and a variety of women as much as it is men. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Very importantly, the amateurs and the professionals race at the same time in triathlon, so the amateur athletes can see me race. They see me race, they see me beat the men and they can see how strong we are, and that has an influence, because in their psyche they already see women as strong and successful, rather than as secondary athletes. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The last thing I want to touch on, separately to triathlon, is what has been successful internationally, particularly in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, where I spent most of my time: Title IX. While Title IX has had its critics, I feel, from speaking to people in the US—athletes, those in policy and those who worked for NGOs—that it has been overwhelmingly positive, and I think we can learn a lot here in the UK from that legislation in ensuring gender equality and the provision of resources, events and support in our educational establishments.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q70 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tracey Crouch:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Lottie, you spoke about Title IX quite a lot in your written evidence. I did not play my first competitive football match until I went to university, which was in 1993. We had a Canadian goalkeeper, and by the time she got to university, the amount of grassroots football she had had was completely different to what was available in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. Is that something that emanates—obviously not in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Canada</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, but is that something that you have seen?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lottie Birdsall-Strong</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes. I would like to say that my thesis that I am writing at </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Cambridge</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is all about Title IX. It is a proposal of why and how we can construct a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> equivalent to adapt to our system here. I think it is crucial in a first step, really. If we are not guaranteeing that female students are having equal opportunity to participate and gain funding and resource from the get-go, until we have that in place, it seems very difficult to see how we can move forward meaningfully. Title IX, statistically, has been absolutely brilliant. Since it was passed in 1972, participation rates for female students in the States have gone up by 403%. The stats are there and they do not lie. It is crucial, and I think we need something here that is similar. We currently have no single piece of legislation that guarantees or monitors that female students are getting equal amounts of funding, resource and opportunity in our state system as their male counterparts. If you applied that to any other subject, there would be uproar, and we need to consider that it is just as important that this is occurring in PE in sport.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q71 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tracey Crouch:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Joanne, from your own international experience, what do you see?

Whether it was </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">America</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> or </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">South Africa</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, there was a huge amount of time. They had time and they had the same motivation. I think it comes down to a lot of role models and the teachers they had in the schools, the people in the community, the facilities they had. If they had a half day on a Wednesday, for example, they would dedicate that entire time. I am not just saying it was just girls; it was boys as well. They had the people there who were supporting them to do that. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I sometimes find that male sport, especially, is such a social thing. The lads go down on a Saturday afternoon to play football, or to watch with their brothers and their dads, whereas </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">women are still breaking that barrier—that sport can be a very social and a great way of spending your time. It is not a waste of time. It is not a bad thing to get fit. You do not have to waste hours away at the gym. That was what </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">America</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">South Africa</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> really showed me: just by giving those few extra hours and pushing those role models through, you could achieve it. I was in the very poor part of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">South Africa</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.  They had one netball post, but they played a version of the game whereby it did not matter. It was playing to the same end. It is modifying the game to adapt to needs and the scenario that you have, I think. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Too many people make excuses. What I find in this country is, “Oh, I don’t have the time,” or, “I don’t have the beautiful grass facility”. Actually, the game can still be played. It might just have to be modified in the way that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">America</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> does. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">America</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> goes in a very open-hearted, enthusiastic way, and in enthusing others to bring a friend along, and if that girl then enjoys it, she brings her best friend along and then her mum comes down to watch.

How important do you think female coaches and managers are as acting as role models? I declare an interest in that I am a female coach and a manager in an all-girls club, but I am the only female manager in that club. How do we get more mums to participate, or get women who have perhaps seen the end of their career in football because of age back involved in the game? How do we find them?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Joanne Herbertson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I am in a similar situation up in Northumberland, as I am the only female coach in our club.  It is not a huge club; only 300 juniors take part. We now have 30 girls coming on a weekly basis. It is about breaking down the barrier of fear of failure for those women. The fact is that mums do not need to have played football. As Lottie was saying, football in this country is still growing and developing. Break down the barrier that you have to be a top athlete to coach. I am sitting between these wonderful sportswomen here.  Sometimes I barely put one foot in front of another on a good day, but I sell my sport through enthusiasm.  We can get those women to come along and take just a few girls, and attend those courses that are adapted—in my experience, the NGBs are making it easier. For example, cricket has a one-day coaching assistants’ course now, rather than the traditional three days, so it does not take as much time out of their calendar. The FA is doing all its work to encourage ladies and women as well. As role models within a club, it is huge.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q73 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tracey Crouch:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Chrissie, you do a lot to promote women’s sport. Are you getting back involved in coaching? Would you do that in the future, either in triathlon or in the individual parts that make up triathlon?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Christine Anne Wellington</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: That is really not where I see my career trajectory going. I want to get more involved in policy, lobbying, advocacy and influencing work, but I truly believe in the power of role models. I think it is absolutely important, not just as female coaches and managers, but also athletes. We need to recognise that role models vary over a life cycle, so the role model for a very young person is much more likely to be in their everyday life—their parents, their teachers—whereas when they get to adolescence, the role models start to be a bit wider, and then perhaps as you get older they become role models within your social circle. Again, I think we need to recognise that role models come in a wide variety of forms. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There is definitely a lack of women in positions of leadership—coaches, managers, those working in NGBs—and we need to look at what the barriers are. I read that the Women’s </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Sport and Fitness Foundation is calling for a target, and I support that, but I also think we need to look at the barriers. Why are women not getting involved in coaching, as Jo says? Are there the leadership programs? Is there mentoring and buddying? Is it a time issue? Is it a crèche facility issue? What are the barriers? Why are women not getting involved in coaching? There do not have to be former athletes who become coaches. I think we do need to look at the practical barriers that are preventing women from getting involved in the leadership positions within sport. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We also need to look at the perception of sport and how we market sport. I do not think we are doing a particularly good job of marketing our sports effectively. As Lottie said, it is not about men’s sport and women’s sport. Sport is sport, regardless. Women’s sport is exciting and thrilling because that is what it is, not because it is women’s sport. I think we need to market it effectively. We need to effectively market our role models and particularly our athletes. We need to look carefully at what is going to appeal to our audiences, and market our athletes, our sports, our coaches and our managers—those involved in sport—in a way that is going to appeal to those audiences. I do think there is a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the branding and perception of women’s sport and employment in women’s sport.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q74 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tracey Crouch:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> In a more gender-neutral kind of way, or do you think it should be just equal marketing?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Christine Anne Wellington</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We need to look at our sport’s strengths and our sport’s weaknesses and market it on the basis of its strengths, not on the basis of what it is not, vis-à-vis men’s sport, but carefully look at what the sport’s strengths are, but also look at what appeals to the different demographic. What is going to appeal to a six-year-old, a 16-year-old and a 60-year-old is not the same. The images that we use are not going to be the same. Sport is competing with a range of cultural influences for people’s attention and we need to look at that. At the moment, girls would be forgiven for wanting to be Cheryl Cole or a wife of a footballer because that is what they see. That is the role model that they have, but there are other role models, and the Olympics gave us that, but they seem to have faded again into the background. The Vicky Pendletons, Jessica Ennises and Ellie Simmonds were amazing role models, and we promoted the hell out of them last year, but now we hardly see them. I think we really need to look at the way in which we are marketing. I am referring now to female athletes, but I also think of coaches, those who work in sport and the images that we use of people playing sport generally, and it is about ensuring that that appeals to the everyday person. Make sure that we are keeping pace in this fast-moving world with changes in culture and interests and understand that we are competing with not just men’s sport, but a wide variety of interests for other people’s time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q75 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Did each of you have role models?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Christine Anne Wellington</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I did, and mine changed as time progressed. Like I said, my parents were my role models growing up, but also at school I benefited from having really strong positive role models in my teachers, and that was absolutely fundamental for me. They instilled the self-belief and confidence that I think I have had for the rest of my life. That was really, really important. Zola Budd also, growing up as a young girl, was someone who was visible to me, and I do distinctly remember running around the garden in bare feet saying I wanted to be like her.  Then, as I became a professional athlete, obviously I looked to people particularly within the professional triathlon arena as role models. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q76 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you get letters from young girls saying, “I want to be Chrissie Wellington”?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Christine Anne Wellington</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is an honour to receive those messages. I am very grateful for that, but I do not think it happens by accident. I think it happens because of the way in which my wider support team has marketed me, the way in which I carry myself and the manner in which I raced. I am by no means perfect, and I do not want to hold myself up as an ideal, but I do think that professional athletes have a responsibility to behave professionally, and that means on and off the pitch. There is a really important role for the support team behind the athlete and for the NGBs to enable the athlete better to represent themselves, and for providing PR training for the agent to ensure that they secure the commercial opportunities that will best enable the athlete to promote themselves not only as an athlete, but as a brand. Yes, in answer to your question, I do receive such letters, but I do think that that is not simply luck. It has been engineered carefully by the team around me. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Joanne Herbertson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: For me it is family. I have never had one role model; I tend to pick and choose. I love the idea of taking the best bits from everybody I see, whether it be teachers or family. From a grass-roots perspective, my family have been phenomenal, and I think the families of those children out there we are trying to reach, and the women out there, and the sisters and everybody else, are the ones we need to get to encourage the individuals to just come along and give it a try. They are not asking them to be the best. They are not asking them to be a permanent fixture or to pay club membership straight away, but we need that family support to bring them. Chrissie said before that her parents were the greatest taxi drivers when she was starting school and sport. Bring them to training and drop them off. Say that they love watching them train. It is my parents; my dad has been following me all morning, making sure that I am checking and doing everything right, but he is a great advocate of women in sport and of taking this opportunity now, which we are at the best time to do so.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lottie Birdsall-Strong</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I was similarly very lucky in that my parents were really supportive of me. My dad took me to women’s football matches and men’s football matches from the age of five, and both of my parents were very much just, “If you want to do it, you can do it,” which is great. I think it is important to remember that with children, and particularly with girls, the buyer of the sport is not necessarily going to be them in terms of a true autonomy there. Parents do have a role here. It is dads getting their daughters involved as well as their sons, and mums asserting that it is okay for their daughters to go and get muddy playing sport and to enjoy it. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In terms of role models, I was always very lucky, because from a young age I was at the Arsenal Centre of Excellence, and the likes of Rachel Yankey and Faye White were in and around. They came and took training sessions with us, and I was in awe of them. They were heroes for me. I had a ladder in front of me to say, “If you do this and you work hard,” or whatever, “that could be at the end of it.” As I say, if you are lucky enough to be involved at a strong club or at a high level, you have so much more of an easier access, because that was first hand; that was direct. I was not picking up newspapers and turning to the back page and thinking, “Oh”. I was a fan of male football players and knew about them. That was the indirect.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q77 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Leech:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You have all said that your parents were very influential and were role models when you were younger.

But I do not think that is to say that if my dad was not there to do that and I had asked, my mum would not have taken me. Yes, I think mums are just as important. It is not necessarily about mums and dads. It is just about the roles that they play in a family, and I think mums and dads both really need to be giving off the idea that sport is for girls and boys, and if you want to do it, you can. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I guess this is why I am slightly obsessed with the education system, because realistically we do not have that much control over mums and dads having that attitude. We can work to help that, but I do not think in terms of measurable change that a realistic target is a sweeping change of culture and a mindset of parenting. So, can we set something up that ensures that girls who do not have parents who think that a playing a certain sport is a good idea can access that at school?  That is a bit more realistic.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Joanne Herbertson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Sorry. Can I just jump in and say I think Lottie is exactly right, but we are actually coaching now the mums of tomorrow? I know for a fact that my mum is a very traditional mum. She left work so my dad could go out and be the main breadwinner. She took care of the children, and I loved her for that. That was her supportive role. But we are now at that change, and I think that is why we are having this inquiry now—these things are changing. The perception is changing, and I am going to be that mum who drags that lovely child of mine down to the park and says, “Come on, let’s go and play with a cricket bat, the rounders bat. Let’s go and play football.” I think that is why it is so important that when we go out and coach, we are saying it is all right to do that. This is change. This is now, where it is all right not to be that traditional role. You can be both. You can go out and be that coach, as well as your dad.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q79 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Leech:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you think that we have broken down that barrier and that we will reap the rewards?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Joanne Herbertson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think we are slowly heading to it. I am an eternal optimistic, as all of my friends and family will tell you. I think we are getting there. With the likes of Chrissie and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Lottie becoming advocates and policy advocates, you can see that change. The children I coach tell me that they will coach their kids, and there are the young adults and mums who go away and play cricket with a glass of wine in their hand. I am not expecting them to play cricket in the same way men do, but they play cricket in their way and their time, and, yes, with their families. I think time ahead is good. It is bright.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Christine Anne Wellington</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I would agree, and I would also like to add that it is important that attention is paid to the needs specifically of mothers in enabling access to a range of different sports. Mothers, especially young mothers, have quite specific needs, and we do need to look at access to facilities, the type of facilities that are offered and the times at which those opportunities for physical activity are offered so that, at such a time when women become mothers, they do not suddenly stop doing exercise or physical activity, and the opportunities are still open for them to participate so that they can then impart that to their children, both in terms of being visible role models, and also actually maybe engaging in sport with their children in family-based activities, or having activities that can take place synonymously so that mothers can participate at the same time as their children. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There are a range of different options, but I do think, yes, if mothers are to continue to be active, positive, healthy role models, attention does need to be paid specifically to addressing some of the barriers that they may face in continuing activity once they have children.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q80 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Leech:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Chrissie, the story that you gave us at the beginning sounded pretty similar to a lot of my female friends at university who had done some sport, but dropped out when it came to university. While they dropped out and stayed dropped out, you went on and won four world championships, which is somewhat different. It sounded as though that was a bit by chance—you just suddenly took up running. I do not know whether it was that you just one day decided to take up running, but it sounded as though there was an element of good fortune or that made you take up running at a certain time in your life, and then obviously you were really good at it. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:35.45pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What is it that most people need, that you clearly did not need, either to keep themselves involved at that age or get back into it? Clearly you had the drive and determination to do it—running 25 miles, swimming three miles and cycling 100 miles, or whatever it is—but perhaps the vast majority of young women at that age do not have quite that drive and determination, so what is it that they need extra, that you did not need, to succeed?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Christine Anne Wellington</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I would suggest that there are a variety of motivations and triggers, and a variety of barriers to participation, and they are going to vary widely. We cannot see women as a homogenous group. We cannot target them as if all women are the same. Age, background, culture, experience, parental support, education—all those types of things are going to influence what motivates women to take up sport or what prevents them from doing physical activity, and I think we need really to understand our target audience and that demographic, and the various barriers and motivations, to be able effectively to design the solutions. A variety of offerings is incredibly important. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What is going to appeal to me is definitely not going to appeal to Jo or Lottie.

We need a wide variety of offerings. There is no one right sport. There is no wrong sport for people to do. There needs to be a variety of different sports played in a variety of different ways, in a variety of different locations, and marketed in a way, as I said, that appeals to a range of different people. The marketing that you need to attract a 25-year-old back into physical activity is very different from attracting a 60-year-old back into physical activity, and we really need to look at both aspects. It is the sports that are offered and the variety within those sports, as Jo mentioned. It does not just have to be cricket, as there is a wide variety of types of cricket, and it is the same for football. Then there is also how we market those sports. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q82 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jim Sheridan:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Can I ask just a couple of questions about the structures in the sporting world? They are mostly made up of men, and everyone agrees—some of the people we have spoken to in these various Committee meetings—that we need more women involved in the senior levels. The FA is a classic example. But nothing ever seems to happen. Everyone agrees, and then it goes into the long grass. Parallels are somewhat the same in the political world. They have been introduced as positive discrimination, and in this place we changed the working hours to accommodate families and so on. At that stage everybody thought we need more women MPs, but nothing ever happened, so we brought in positive discrimination and things changed. Is that something that you have been thinking about—positive discrimination in sporting bodies?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Christine Anne Wellington</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think we need an array of carrots and sticks to attract more women into positions of leadership in sporting bodies. In order to do that, we also need to understand, like I said, the barriers. Is it because there is a lack of role models? Is there a lack of mentoring or buddying programmes? Is there a lack of developmental opportunities? At the club level, are clubs not transitioning promising individuals up through the ranks and training them effectively so that they then can transition into the NGBs? What are the barriers that are facing women? The only way we can answer that is to go out there and ask, and go out there and see what is preventing women from getting involved in NGBs and the governance of our sport more generally. Only then can we develop effective solutions. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q83 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jim Sheridan:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Will the leadership change without positive discrimination?

My opinion of what it is is that, at the minute, male sports dominates, so some form of discrimination has happened already, in a hassle-free way. Why don’t we have slightly positive discrimination now, just as a short-term boost for women in sport?  For example, my job title is “women and girls’ cricket coach”, but I could coach a boy or a girl or a man—anybody; I do not mind—but the title is slightly discriminative, so that focuses that group.  We could get to a point where, in the long term, we will not need those gender roles. I think, for now, that perhaps a little bit of discrimination would just give us a bit of push and a bit of awareness of what we need in society.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lottie Birdsall-Strong</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Positive discrimination is complex and quite controversial at times, and there are a lot of arguments for and against, but I think that saying that everybody agrees that we need or want more women involved, when that is not happening, is a slight paradox, really, because if everybody really wanted that, it would happen.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Looking at why it is not happening, there are different things going on. Perhaps the women involved in an organisation are not necessarily climbing, or perhaps women are just not there in the first place. If there are fewer women in a whole organisation, it would follow that there would be fewer women in the more senior ranks of an organisation. You have to take each one differently in terms of what the problem is. It is a problem, but I am not really sure, looking at stats and stuff, whether positive discrimination has been beneficial, but I think that in terms of corporate quotas, particularly—away from sport in the more corporate world—there are stats to show that the more diverse the mix of a given board, the more successful it is. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q84 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jim Sheridan:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I do not want to pursue the point, but certainly there is déjà vu for me.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Moving on to the press and media coverage for women’s sport, just recently in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> we had a very popular columnist who wrote a very derogatory article about women’s football, and the paper was inundated with complaints and he almost lost his job. As a result, he had to make a grovelling apology. If we look at the sports pages of the papers,  there are not very many sports writers who are women. Why is that? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lottie Birdsall-Strong</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think that there are plenty of women students doing sports journalism at uni. There are probably fewer than there are males, but there will be enough to show that it is a problem that there are not many female sports journalists in mainstream papers. I do not know what is going on there. I think it would be plausible to say that they are not getting those jobs—not being selected—because women are perhaps considered to be less knowledgeable about sport, and therefore less capable to report on it well. That might be a bit reductionist and simplistic but, when it comes down to it, I do not see what else it could be, really, because I think they are around. I know a few women who would like to be sports journalists. I would say it is a fair claim that the pathway to get into that industry will be harder for young women than young men. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Joanne Herbertson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think the way the media are presented now has changed as well. Your traditional back page of the newspaper is still a big part of the media, but you have social media now. I rely heavily on social media because it is instant and quick.  It fits into my timetable.  I can report back to my boss and send a quick e-mail. I might not have time to write a match-day article like we used to, but a quick tweet can say what the scores were and who played well—things like that. I think that perception of where media changes—I know I am surrounded by a lot of women who use that a lot more. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">At the Women Play Sport conference last week in Loughborough, there was Shelley, a lady from the BBC who does all the productions of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">The Football League Show</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and things like that, and she has put a huge effort in. I think that team is slowly growing, but it is just a change of how we read sport all over.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Christine Anne Wellington</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Again, as with the positions in the NGBs, we need to look at the barriers. Are sufficient women being trained? Are there sufficient women who are qualified to take those positions? If there are, there is a problem, but is there a problem earlier on in enabling women to transition from university to get the jobs perhaps lower down within newspapers that will enable them to transition up? Is there a lack of role models, and a lack of mentoring and peer support? All those questions need to be asked, but I do not think it is necessarily the fact that there is a lack of women in sports journalism that means that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">there is a lack of coverage of sports involving women. Men can cover women’s sports, so I do not necessarily think the two have to be seen as related. It is not necessarily that a woman has to come in to improve the quantity of media coverage, as the quality of media coverage has to be there. It is not a case that any TV coverage is good coverage. The quality of the coverage of women’s sport has to improve as much as the quantity, and that does not mean that it is only women who can make that happen. I think men can make it happen just as much.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q85 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jim Sheridan:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Just finally, Chrissie, you talk about employers bringing more fitness equipment into the workplace, which seems a bit ambitious in these difficult times. Having said that, the Committee visited Google in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">America</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, where there were tennis courts and running machines, and that was a very contented work force.

We need to offer a wider variety of activities at a wide variety of locations. There are a lot of things that are competing for people’s time, men and women, and work takes up a lot of that time. If there is the possibility of combining work with physical activity, which would include potentially employers providing some kind of provision for their employees to do physical activity either before work, in their lunch hour or after work, I think that would be really helpful. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It does not necessarily have to be hardware provision. It is not that I expect every office to have a running machine, but I think employers need to see the link between health and fitness, and the increased productivity of their work force. That link has been proven, regarding not just workers’ productivity, but educational attainment, but perhaps people are not aware of it. Perhaps it has not been effectively articulated to the employer that the more physically or mentally healthy their employees are, the more productive they are.  I think if employers understood that, they might be more willing to invest in ensuring the health of their work force. I definitely see a place for employers in enabling their employees to be more healthy, and more generally I would like to see increased opportunities to combine sports with leisure activities. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I had a great experience as very, very novice runner with the Nike store on </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Oxford Street</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. They offered night runs out of their store every Wednesday. They were divided into novice, intermediate and advanced. It was just open to all. It cost Nike nothing, but obviously I think Nike is such a strong, powerful brand that people were attracted to that and it enabled them better to market that offering to a wider demographic than simply runners. I had a good experience of combining the retail with running.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jim Sheridan:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Probably buying Nike trainers. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Christine Anne Wellington</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Obviously there is a commercial interest, but the two do not need to be mutually exclusive. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Joanne Herbertson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We did a workplace challenge—this runs perfectly with what you were saying—in Northumberland, and we had different work forces from places such as hotels and offices.  Everybody came along and had an entire day, with a little championship programme, and what came of that was fantastic.
