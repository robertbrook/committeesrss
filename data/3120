font-size:12pt">physio</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> Derek Wright pleaded guilty to an offence of driving without due care and attention when he had failed to observe the warning lights, which were said to have been operational for 25 seconds.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial;

font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> Only upon receipt of this information did the police and, one assumes, Nexus undertake a more comprehensive investigation and discovered that, whilst the lights were working correctly, they were not correctly aligned, which meant that they were not visible to drivers until they were effectively at the level crossing.</span><span style="font-family:Arial;

font-size:12pt">It appears to my client that, perhaps more often than anyone currently appreciates, collisions and near misses at level crossing are not necessarily the result of driver error or impatience, but a failure of rail operators (and the police) to ensure the warning lights are not only working, but correctly aligned, so that they can be clearly seen by drivers as they approach such a level crossing.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial;
