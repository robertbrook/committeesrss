All Waitrose fresh beef, pork, chicken, eggs and milk are British, being procured through a short supply chain built on the producer group principle that we pioneered. We work closely with our farmers helping them drive efficiencies at farm level which in turn helps ensure that waste is reduced at farm gate and so wastage overall is reduced.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">In Waitrose we believe that waste is not just food that is thrown away, but can be categorised as missed production opportunities whether caused by weather anomalies or bad planning and forecasting. </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We have produced a Waitrose Farm Assessment Report which we will send to the Committee under separate cover. We believe that this will shed further light onto our approach.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We also believe we need to find new ways of investing in the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">agri</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">-economy to give the best possible chance of success to farming enterprises of all sizes and types. When we write about efficiency, we are not suggesting that bigger is better, simply that better is better. We believe that there is a place in UK farming for enterprises of all sizes, just as there is a place for businesses of all sizes in the wider economy.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">It seems likely that small scale farmers, as they plan to deliver the efficiencies necessary to make small farms viable, will be key drivers of wider innovation in the future.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We think it also important that the issue of investment for smaller tenanted farms is addressed. Long term investment for tenants is difficult without the ‘blue ribbon’ security offered by freehold land ownership. Tenanted holdings offer the best opportunity to attract new entrants into agriculture. </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">2.2 The relationship between the price of food and the cost of producing it.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">On farm efficiency is a key cost deflator at farm level and anything that can be done to drive such efficiencies must be welcomed as it ultimately impacts on the price of food. In Waitrose we help our farmers find investment through banker briefings (where we bring farmers and bankers together) to allow them to drive efficiencies and reduce their costs. We also work with businesses such as Anglia Farmers, a large buying cooperative, to help them source inputs at a much reduced cost.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Precision farming is another key way of improving efficiency. By precision farming we are not simply talking about the application of technology, but the importance of farmers working with customers so they supply the right produce at the right time. Again, this is an area in which our close relationship with our farmers is invaluable.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Retailers should be encouraged to take whole farm output to ensure the maximum amount of crop is utilised. For example, in Waitrose we buy the whole carcass, ensuring that farm waste is limited and costs are kept under control at farm level allowing higher reinvestment. We also flex specifications to allow the utilisation of cosmetically imperfect produce, helping our growers mitigate volatile weather patterns.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We suggest that there needs to be more support for R&amp;D in UK agriculture but acknowledge that the Government’s </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Agri</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> Tech Strategy is beginning to address this. At Waitrose we are working with a number of partners including Aberystwyth University and the Soil Association to apply research and apply new science at field level.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold"> 2.3 The implications of volatility in global food supply and demand for UK food security.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Market volatility is another key driver in price instability, which in turn makes it hard for farmers to make accurate investment decisions. In a free market it is difficult to know what can practically be done about this issue.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Another aspect of a volatile market is that it drives producers to seek out other markets. This means that the UK market could be overlooked for south/south trade. This not only impacts on the ability of UK retailers to provide year round choice but also limits their ability to develop offers from new origins</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">2.4 The potential value and contribution of science and GM technology to UK food security.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">As we have stated, science and technology has a role to play in UK food security. However, whatever form that may take, it must be applied sensitively and the public must be convinced of its safety and benefits.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">During the original green revolution, technology was applied on an open commons basis to ensure that good science was used for the benefit of all. Perhaps a similar approach could be trialled with key </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">agri</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> tech developments in the future. This would demonstrate the benefits of a technological approach in the best possible light.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">2.5 How food and farming supply chains, and the current systems for traceability,</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold"> can contribute to increased resilience.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Waitrose has operated short supply chains in most of its produce areas for many years and pioneered the producer group system that sits at their core.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Close working relationships between farmers and their customers develops trust which gives confidence to invest in long term business improvements (new infrastructure, land improvements etc) which in turn builds resilience. </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Our work with dedicated processors such as Dovecote Park (beef) ensures we have much improved traceability. Something we could not guarantee if we bought produce on the open market.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Also, our close work with producers has enabled us to produce the Waitrose Farm Assessment (which will be sent under separate cover to the Committee). This has seen the Waitrose Agronomy Group working hand in hand with scientists and farmers to develop soil and water action plans to built resilience and efficiency. We have done this with farms based in many different countries. This would have been impossible without the trust built up over many years working as partners in a win/win endeavour.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Furthermore, our work in Africa through the Waitrose Foundation, where we divert a portion of our profits to fund on-farm social projects has built resilience. It has helped ensure that Foundation farms are well run with mutual respect between owners and employees and the resultant desire for the business to do well. This results in efficiency and quality benefits along the supply chain.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">2.6 Whether climate change risks are adequately incorporated in UK food security strategies and planning.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We believe that climate change is not being adequately planned for in the UK. However, climate change planning is a key part of the Waitrose Farm Assessment which we will attach separately and which discusses producer soil and water plans and their importance in driving efficiencies.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">2.7 The obstacles facing food producers, including small farmers, seeking to increase production and access new markets.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">As we said earlier, we need to address issues of investment for smaller, family farms and land tenure and longer term security of holding for tenant farmers. </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">2.8 Ways of increasing self sufficiency in products for which the UK has a comparative advantage.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We need to look at ways to make it attractive to grow this kind of food.
