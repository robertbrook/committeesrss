Its inclusivity is reflected in its board members and networks – Several Local Authorities, Social Enterprise West Midlands, Sustainable Housing, Action Partnership, Improvement and Efficiency West Midlands, and Birmingham Social Housing Partnership amongst others and will expand in time to include contracting authorities from Education, Health and the Emergency Services. </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="color:#1f497d; font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Public bodies and third sector organisations, that have sometimes been resistant to working with BCC, are now combining their procurement needs with the local authority via BFG which makes all members equal partners. BFG also aims to address another major challenge facing public purchasing: how to balance the need to use large scale national frameworks to drive down prices with the need to support SMEs to deliver local jobs and skills as well as reducing environmental impact.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="color:#1f497d; font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">We believe the answer is a social value-focused shared services model for back office support, which is stand-alone, can trade freely, has minimal overheads and is easily replicable. Contracts are open to public and third sector organisations; they are locality-based and focus heavily on boosting local supply markets. Each framework also aims to minimise any adverse environmental impacts associated with the provision of good and services.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="color:#1f497d; font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">The BFG model is based on rebates which provide a sustainable model. BCC provided a procurement resource to BFG when it was first established and now the council earns an income from this initial investment, whilst also reducing its cost base and that of other public bodies in the area. With pressure mounting on public services to find more efficient ways of delivering shared services, it makes sense for bodies from across the public and third sectors to combine demand and put their trust in community interest companies that can reduce costs and enhance policy outcomes.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="color:#1f497d; font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">The Council is in year 4 of the Highways Maintenance and Management PFI contract.  Those advising on this contract were involved in its negotiation.  The Council is also making changes to the contract to deliver substantial savings and efficiencies from it.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="color:#1f497d; font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Long term contracts such as this require an extensive partnership working approach, which can be challenging to implement.  The Council does work well in partnership with its Service Provider on this contract and there is a good mutual understanding of the need for a partnership approach, particularly to requirements for savings.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="color:#1f497d; font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">However, from the Council’s experience with this contract, making changes to a PFI contract such as achieving savings is a very complicated process that involves not only the Service Provider but also its lenders.  In particular, due to the long-term nature of the contract and the significant financial commitments involved the lenders are particularly resistant to change.  This approach from lenders is not always congruent with the required partnership approach and has caused some difficulty in adapting a long term contract to the emerging requirements of the Council with regards to savings.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">3. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">   </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">a) How can local authorities access the skills, expertise and capabilities to implement effective procurement strategies, including value for money and social and economic objectives? </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="color:#1f497d; font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">The Council recruit from both the public and private sector to gain the skills needed as there is a general shortage of high calibre individuals </span><span style="color:#1f497d; font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">in both sectors </span><span style="color:#1f497d; font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">with the skills and expertise required.  BCC implemented a Category Management approach in 2008 which has resulted in Contract Managers gaining expertise in their market areas.  The Managers work with directorates across the council to understand their purchasing requirements and expenditure and support them in producing quality procurement strategies for each market area.  </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="color:#1f497d; font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">The Council’s professional staff regularly works with external professionals on major projects.  This will be with either external consultants it commissions or external </span><span style="color:#1f497d; font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">consultants who are representing bidders.  This facilitates a two way learning process of how procurement processes can be improved.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="color:#1f497d; font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">The Council’s legal department staff regularly has two lawyers who assist Local Partnerships to undertake a gateway review of the projects of other public authorities.  It also provides legal advice on procurement advice to other public bodies.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="color:#1f497d; font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Value can be added in financial terms such as savings on prices, improving processes to reduce cost and procuring against a specification that costs less.
