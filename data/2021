All of these are unintended consequences, and it is unclear whether these impacts have been calculated and factored in to the proposals as they stand.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Anne </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Longfield</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Chief Executive, 4Children</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">13 September 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:14pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="color:#792a8a; font-family:Arial; font-size:14pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
