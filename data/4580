The De</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">partment appears to take a decision to pre-approve the proposals on the basis of the evidence garnered by these campaigns alone and without any attempt to conduct genuine assessments of their likely equality or wider community impact. This preapproval is t</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">hen used by sponsor organisations to effectively prejudice the statutory consultation, a consultation which is itself deeply flawed in being targeted and shaped around constituencies determined by the sponsors, on a timescale that suits them and on such a </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">narrow question that there is virtually no possibility of conscientiously reflecting on or amending the proposals.</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">26.
