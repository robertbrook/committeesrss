These include clause 2 which affects Employment Tribunal's power to make recommendations and clause 35 which relates to the Government's intention to remove the duty on the Senior President of Tribunals to report on the standards of decision making by the DWP. We have also commented on c</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">lause 58 which gives a new duty for regulators to have regard for promoting economic growth. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">We believe none of these clauses will achieve the primary purpose of the draft Bill: to reduce the burden of regulation on business, civil society, other organisations (including public sector bodies) and individuals.  Rather, we believe these amendments may be more costly and burdensome in the long term. They will also diminish transparency and reduce the mechanisms in place to hold organisations to account and protect vulnerable groups in society, including people living with HIV. The evidence for this is set out below. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Clause 2- Employment Tribunal's power to make recommendations</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">NAT strongly disagrees with the proposals to remove Employment Tribunal's power to make recommendations to an employer in a case where unlawful discrimination occurred. As we stated in our previous consultation on this change to the Equality Act 2010</span><a name="_ftnref1"></a><a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> we believe this power is extremely important to ensure discrimination towards people living with HIV in the workplace does not occur again.  For example, our own experience shows once a case is taken to Tribunal, the employee very rarely wants to return to work for this employer. The Employment Tribunal's power to make an appropriate recommendation when it has made a finding of unlawful discrimination is one crucial mechanism to incentivise employers to change their current practice to ensure HIV discrimination is eradicated. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The proposed change is also not evidence-based as there is no research to show this Tribunal power is an unnecessary burden to employers.</span><a name="_ftnref2"></a><a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">  We believe the current provision is actually beneficial and cost effective as it avoids future cases being taken to Tribunal.

People living with HIV who are from a black, Asian or minority ethnic background and/or who are LGBT may also face associated or double discrimination which again could be caused by wider issues at an organisation on which the Tribunal may wish to comment. Removing this power will therefore disproportionately impact on people living with HIV.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; text-decoration:underline">We recommend that the current powers are retained as they have the potential to save vital resources in the current economic climate, assisting employers to</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; text-decoration:underline">take</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; text-decoration:underline"> appropriate steps to avoid future tribunal cases and delivering an overall benefit for the business as a whole.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Clause 35 - Removal of the duty on the senior President of tribunals to report on the standards of decision making by the DWP</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Clause 35 relates specifically to the Government's intention to remove the duty on the Senior President of Tribunals to prepare and publish an annual report on the standards of decision making by the DWP.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">We oppose the change as we believe the annual report on DWP decision-making is an important means to ensure transparency and accountability in the assessment of decision-making in relation to key benefits.

While the annual report is not the sole solution to the wider problem of poor initial decision-making (and the Independent Review made a range of specific suggestions to improve feedback mechanisms) it does provide the only </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">statutory </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">mechanism currently in place by which to identify serious and systemic problems with DWP decision-making.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">In July this year the new benefit Personal Independence Payment (PIP) was introduced to replace the Disability Living Allowance (DLA) for new claimants.
