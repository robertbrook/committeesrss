These states also have weak child protection systems and limited social </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">protection mechanisms which can help to prevent child abuse.

We have found that children’s involvement in mining</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> can take two forms; firstly some children work individually or with their families in small scale unregulated artisanal mining sites where they use basic techniques to dig for and extract precious metals. These metals are then sold through a series of mid</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">dle men and some of these metals will end up with the big gold or diamond trading houses where they are either sold domestically or exported.  Some children combine mining with attending school, or use the income from mining towards school costs, but many </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">others work for up to 15 hours a day, and do not earn enough for an evening meal at the end of the working day. Secondly, children also work illegally on larger and more regulated mining sites which are owned by big mining companies.
