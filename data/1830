NASS is unconvinced that a new set of Framework Agreements will result in an improvement system for local authorities or children and young people. While many local authorities are positive about framework agreements there is little formal evidence to suggest that they contribute to making efficiency saving, improve relationships with providers or ultimately improve outcomes for children and young people. NASS would be keen for the committee to explore a number of factors around Framework Agreements including the cost to local authorities of running them and the estimated cost to providers of completing tender paperwork. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="12" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Fostering frameworks now proliferate across local government and run alongside significant levels of spot purchase.
