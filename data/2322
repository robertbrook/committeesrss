font-size:12pt">specific </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">accommodation needs of the Gypsy and Traveller communities living in their areas.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Section 8 of the Housing Act 1985</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial;

font-size:12pt">Section 8 (1) actually says:-</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Every local housing authority shall consider housing conditions in their district and the needs of the district with respect to the provision of further housing accommodation.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Given that the duty to </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">consider the "needs of the district" will still apply </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">in the future, it would only be sensible to continue the requirement to produce housing strategies and statements for reasons of public accountability at the very least. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">The key issue in respect of unauthorised Gypsy &amp; Traveller encampments is the lack of accommodation for the Travelling community. The shortage of suitable sites for Gypsy and Traveller families to live on and access as they move around the country leads to groups setting up unauthorised encampments (and increasingly unauthorised developments), thus creating the biggest single source of conflict between the Travelling and settled communities. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Local Authorities were previously under a formal legal duty to provide sites for Gypsies and Travellers. This was established by the Caravan Sites Act 1968 which was a private members bill. The duty upon local authorities to provide sites was repealed by the then Government as a result of measures contained within the Criminal Justice &amp; Public Order Act 1994. By that time less than half of all local </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">authorities had in fact complied with the previous duty. Virtually no action was taken against any authority in respect of that failing. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Over the subsequent years since 1994 - coupled with continued migration and household formation - this has meant that the numbers of Gypsies and Travellers requiring authorised places to live or stop on far outweigh the number of authorised pitches available. In addition to the lack of available authorised pitches, Gypsies and Travellers have also historically found gaining planning permission a major obstacle to providing a site for themselves and their families. Those Gypsies and Travellers who can afford to buy land are frequently in breach of planning laws when they attempt to develop that land for residential use. Subsequently, they find themselves subject to enforcement action and often evicted, frequently resorting to the use of further unauthorised land or accommodation.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Since Section 225 of the Housing Act 2004 was enacted along with other measures, </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">there has been</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> at least </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">some positive progress in site provision</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">, but the effect of Clause 21 of the Deregulation Bill would threaten such progress. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">According to the current most reliable figures, </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">some 20% of the Gypsy and Traveller population in England who live in caravans reside on unauthorised encampments and unauthorised developments.  The simple reason why this occurs is that there is </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">still </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">inadequate provision of sites.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">It has been widely reported that </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">the UN Special Rapporteur on Housing, following her recent visit to the UK, stated:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">In closing, let me also mention that during my visit I have also received multiple testimonies on the shortage of sufficient, adequate and safe sites for Gypsy and Traveller communities across the United Kingdom, many of whom feel this is part of the stigma and discrimination they regularly face from Gover</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">nments and society as a whole. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Despite multiple efforts and policies put in place to address this situation, it is fair to say that leaving local authorities to make their own decision with no accountability and national process to reconcile the Gypsy and Traveller settled communities remains a source of concern.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">The Government’s current planning policy, </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Planning policy for traveller sites</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">, states that every local authority should already have in place a five year deliverable supply of sites.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> As I understand it, </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">virtually no local authorities have such a </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">supply </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">in place within their Local Plan.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">I suggest that this means that </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">not only should there </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">continue to </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">be proper local housing strategies </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">in place </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">but </span><span style="font-family:Arial;

font-size:12pt">the last five decades </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">that local authorities will</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> not </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">provide the necessary sites.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">In summary </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">I foresee considerable issues </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">with Clause 21 </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt;
