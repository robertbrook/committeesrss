A number of pieces of written evidence handed in have suggested that there needs to be a system approach to tackling heat. In your opening remarks, could you say what you think a systems approach would look like?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Donald Daw</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I am happy to go first. The change that we are going to undergo in heating, particularly the change in the whole system approach, recognises that, even though we are a manufacturer of heat pumps, there is no one solution for everything. Particularly the thermal improvement of properties will have as big an impact on the reduction of energy and therefore carbon emissions of heat, as would the change in the technologies; those two things need to go hand in hand. Probably, the organisation and systems required for the early change in off-gas grid is something that will happen before we see a change in the on-gas grid.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Marcus Stewart</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: From National Grid’s perspective, we look at the wider energy system, the electricity networks and the gas networks, and in order to meet the heat decarbonisation targets, we need to consider the energy </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">trilemma</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: security, affordability and sustainability. From a systems point of view, we need to look at not only where we are trying to get to, but where we are starting from as well. It is making the best use of the existing assets in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. We have the most extensive gas network in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. We have a significant electricity system as well. It is looking at when is the right time to move heat demand from the gas system to the electricity system, when power is decarbonised, what are the full system costs in terms of generation, network costs and also the impact on consumers. From our perspective, that is a system. You need to look at all those points, try to understand and go down an optimal pathway.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Kelly Butler</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Similar to Marcus really. We look at systems in two different ways. Firstly, within the dwelling or the building, you can’t disaggregate a heat system and look at an individual component and think that you have done a job. Replacing a boiler, for example, will obviously increase your heat generator efficiency, but if you don’t treat the radiator system then you are probably losing about 15% of efficiency there over time. We have some very new research and information that shows that, if you do not have controls, you are losing about 40% efficiency in your heat system. These are the kind of things that we should be doing within the building, looking at the system in the round.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The extended system or the macro-system, of course, is the relationship with the grid. From our perspective, there is a critical path here that I can’t quite see at the moment. We talk a lot about smart grids and the interaction with electric storage and heat pumps and demand response management, but that is all predicated on time-of-use tariffs and the actual operability and being able to switch loads further back into the system. What we are interested in now is the timescale over which that is going to happen and what the plan is to get there.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Chris Davidson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: From our point of view in the Ground Source Heat Pump Association, while we represent primarily that technology, it cannot be taken in isolation. It is critically important that it interacts with the grid. If we deploy heat pumps incorrectly in the UK then we will suck up an awful lot of electrical generation capacity in a non-thinking way, whereas if we apply the technology properly—and, as Kelly said earlier, controls are the absolute heart of that—so when we as a company, not so much the Ground Source Heat Pump Association now, look at a system, we do look at it in the round. We look at integrating with other technologies and making sure that that whole system works in the lowest possible energy way.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q76 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> On the controls, are there a lot of dwellings where there are no controls as at the moment?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Kelly Butler</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There are 8 million homes without a room thermostat and 9 million homes without a thermostatic radiator in the house. We did some work and looked at the cost of a home without controls per year and it would reduce the cost of heating by 40% if you were to put in a room thermostat and TRVs. The barrier to this is consumer education and knowledge of what the benefits of controls are—supply education as well and installers having not so much the competency but the faith to be able to sell these to customers.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Chris Davidson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think the situation is even more difficult in commercial buildings, where there has been a legacy of poorly installed and installed in isolation systems. These now need to be integrated. We are seeing huge benefits in integrating the control systems, understanding that commercial buildings need to be heated and cooled. For that to be done in the most energy efficient way possible, it is necessary to have controls at the heart of it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q77 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Albert Owen:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Can I move on to the domestic energy policies themselves? As you know, the Government has three main policies to reduce the environmental and economic impacts of domestic heating: ECO, the Renewal Heat Incentive and the Green Deal. How well do you think these are meeting the challenge of heating from both a cost and emissions perspective?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Chris Davidson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: At the moment, in the marketplace commercially, we are finding that certainly in our core technology of ground source heat pumps there have been some serious implementation issues with the commercial RHI. That has meant that the technology that I </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">represent particularly has been disadvantaged from both a tariff point of view and a complexity point of view. There are complexities in ground source heat pumps that do not exist in other technologies, particularly around heating and cooling. We have had to spend an awful lot of time with DECC, and I have to say the people at DECC have been incredibly supportive. It has been frustrating and it has taken a long time, but we now see the policy documents, which should come out very soon, leveraging the technology.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">As far as ECO and Green Deal are concerned, it is early days. I think there is a lot of confusion in the marketplace. There is poor understanding out there. It is improving, but it needs to improve more quickly.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Kelly Butler</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: As Chris has said, it is very early days, but ECO is built on a very successful model of energy supplier obligations going back about 20 years, right the way back to the previous Conservative administration. It is a programme methodology, and I think energy suppliers are right to have that obligation. What we are seeing at the moment is most of the activity appears to be in loft insulation, cavity wall insulation and boilers, which is probably right—insulate before you heat.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The issue for the supply chain is that the way ECO runs out, it is very difficult to predict at what point energy suppliers are going to tackle different elements of the obligation that has been laid down. It is quite hard to gear up for something like that because you do not know when they are going to step in, move away from affordable warmth and into other areas, and it a complex programme. I know that some of the administration on the CSCO, the CERO and the Green Deal are causing some issues.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I would say the Green Deal is having very little impact on our bit of the supply chain. There are not many controls going in. I don’t know why there are Green Deal packages being approved with no controls. It would seem daft to insulate a dwelling and then not control the heat, and I think that is down to the methodology for calculating the Green Deal, which is SAP. We can have a three-hour conversation about that one day, but that is a flawed model.

It is very early to say for domestic RHI because the policy has only just been announced. We are running a series of seminars now with our approved installer network and the latest feedback we had in the past few weeks is that inquiry level is up substantially since the RHI has been announced. Whether they convert to orders is yet to be seen, but the initial response from the people working in the industry already is that there is a greater level of interest from individuals, particularly off-gas grid.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q79 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Albert Owen:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> My crude analysis of what you have said is that ECO is early days—a successful model, but very complicated—and the Green Deal package is flawed.

I am not entirely sure. Putting the obligation on the energy suppliers and the power on the energy suppliers has to be cost-effective because of the economies of scale and their purchasing power. I think if you try to do this in any other way, in any other procurement model, it is quite difficult, unless you go direct taxation and make it a Government agency funded activity, a bit like HEES or Warm Front, as we have had in the past. Then you may be able to get bulk discounts, but the energy supply model seems to work, an initial way of changing.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Chris Davidson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes.

They have been quite effective in reducing emissions on new build, but we are nervous about what appears to be a rollback in our approach to the zero carbon agenda in building regulations. We would have been expecting a far greater increase in reduced emissions and reduced energy consumption in new buildings in this round of regulations. What we have ended up with is 6% and I do not think that is going to do anything to grow much in the way of fabric efficiency and certainly much in the way of renewable heat.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Donald Daw</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think the new build regulations coming in are a lot of softer than they need to be at this point in time, which fully echoes Kelly’s comment. I also think the regulations play an important part in the journey linked with RHI. RHI’s main purpose is to span the gap for regulation and fuel costs, make the use of these alternative technologies the norm.

The RHI is supposed to be taking us to a mass-market approach. This A+ labelling and the building regulations should be delivered under an RHI pathway. In new build, we have building regulations now at 6% and we have the Housing Standards Review, which is suggesting getting rid of the Code for Sustainable Homes. We would have said that would probably be a sensible thing to do if the building regulations were going far enough, but now they are not going far enough I am worried about getting rid of at least the ENE1 element of the Code for Sustainable Homes, which is the energy bit. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The review also suggests repealing the Planning and Energy Act, which in effect pushes through the planning process—and I agree with Chris that planning is key here—to have an element of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">renewables</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> on new build development. If that is repealed, I do not see where the push is going to come from for renewable heat.

I think one of the key areas that is perhaps being missed at the moment is that SAP, because it is so fundamental to building regulations, must be sophisticated enough to understand systems, as we were talking about earlier. It is not at the moment. It is not sophisticated enough, and in many ways it can be a barrier.

The reality was none of our actual heat pumps were part of the main trial, and I will explain shortly.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dan </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Byles</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We will get that on record.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Donald Daw</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes. I will explain why. We started our own monitoring programme prior to the EST programme starting. We have been selling in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> for about six years and we started a programme with the first heat pump we installed. We have had our own monitoring programme running for the same period, which is audited by the EST, and a report was published in parallel to that trial. We recognised from the early days that, however good the heat pump was, if it was not installed properly and, more importantly, it was not designed </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">correctly for houses—that is for low-flow temperatures—then it would be impossible to achieve a coefficient performance that was classed as renewable. The EST trials were a little disappointing to the industry, but I think they were based on installation practices that were not fixed within the industry. We now have the MCS programme for both equipment and installers and that is a mandatory part of claiming RHI. You must use MCS-qualified installers. If they design according to the current criteria, I believe personally that the results will be significantly better than the EST trial.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q90 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dan</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Byles</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Have there been any trials subsequently?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Donald Daw</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Sorry, just let me finish. I can evidence myself from my own trial that, as I say, has been audited by EST, where our average seasonal performance was 3.04, so above the target of 3, and the highest site we had was 3.45. These are all for air source heat pumps. In the research we have done, we have been running an air source, a ground source slinky and a ground source borehole all in parallel on the same heat emitter system in the same property doing different parts of the building and found the ground source with the slinky around 5% better than the air source and the borehole around 10% better, assuming equal technology. I think achieving above 3 is very realistic. You are absolutely right to point out that the design of the installation is the crucial element, but I believe MCS regulations now make the necessary design criteria available to all installers.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q91 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dan </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Byles</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Mr Butler, do you want to come in?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Kelly Butler</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Not especially. The trial did continue, as you may be aware, and there was some very good news in the second part of the trial. For those who do not know, EST went back and did some remedial work on a number of the systems and the good news is that an 80% user satisfaction rating came out of that, so that is good, and the performances went in the right direction as well. The average performance increased as well. As a trial and as a learning activity it was very good, but I think Donald is right. A lot of these were pre-MCS systems. I think they very much helped us to define exactly what needed to be done, industry stepped up to the plate and, in fact, we see MCS as a progressive scheme. We are ramping it up all the time. We have just consulted on improvements to the design and installation standards ready for the RHI—that has all gone through—and we have increased the minimum performance of heat pumps to get certified on to MCS as well for air source and ground source. As an industry, I think we are going in the right direction, because everybody knows that if you want to build a sustainable market you can’t have bad news. You have to be practical and realistic.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q92 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dan </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Byles</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I take it you would disagree with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Calor</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Gas who in their evidence to us said, “</span><span style="font-family:MinionPro-Regular; font-size:12pt">Many heat pumps, when installed, do not do what they say on the tin, and no </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">amount of taxpayer</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">s subsidy can dra</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">w a veil over that.

If I may add to that, the heat pumps that have been installed in the past five years are far less sophisticated from a control perspective than the current heat pumps. A heat pump that you could buy now would be much more intelligent and would modify its performance characteristics to optimise itself for the property, thus keeping the flow temperature as low as possible all the time to deliver the target space temperature, with the same theory applying for the sanitary hot water target.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q98 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dan </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Byles</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What is the typical installation cost for a three-bedroom semi, and how long would you expect the system to last before it needed to be replaced?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Kelly Butler</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We did some analysis for RHI. It is very much dependent on what you are doing to the dwelling, obviously. The performance of a heat pump system is driven by something called the heat emitter guide in the MCS sense. As you go through the star ratings the cost of the installation increases because you are doing more to the distribution to get the temperatures to an optimal level. For an air source heat pump—and Donald may know better than me—we look at around £900 per KW of installed load.

So there is a theoretical advantage to ground source, and that brings me on to a very </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">important point about ground source.

Performance does drop as the temperature goes down at the point when the system is most stressed. What we see and what we put in our long-term projections is, as more and more heat moves on to the electricity system, you will have to build more infrastructure, particularly generation, for a short period of time to meet that energy demand. One of the solutions to that is having hybrid or bivalent devices in the home—that is using gas for a period of time, the very cold parts of winter and possibly hot water, and the performance of the heat pump at warmer temperatures where it is providing a more base-load heat—and when you look at that across the whole energy system, it is quite a cost-effective way of doing it, compared to just building electric heat pumps and having no winter—effectively, a peak shaving type approach.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q100 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dan </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Byles</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Does that require properties to have both systems?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Marcus Stewart</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It would do, yes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q101 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dan </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Byles</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> There is quite a large capital cost there.

There is a trade-off there. The heat pump manufacturers can talk more about this, but a lot of the heat pumps are designed to work in tandem with a boiler and certainly some of the newer boilers are designed to work in tandem with heat pumps as well. The two technologies are able to come together and that would also enable you to offer, in the longer term, balancing-type services to the wider network because you have that ability to move your energy from one system to another. Heat is potentially the largest energy that is going into a property unless, of course, you have an electric vehicle, longer as well. Those are the two main technologies that would be able to offer services into the system in the longer term.

We are cooling the building in the summer. We are then storing that energy and we are putting it back into the shopping centre in winter. We are also now innovating in storing other sources of energy—for example, solar thermal. Putting in a ground source heat pump is an excellent way of capturing some free solar energy in the summer and then vastly increasing the efficiency, the COP, of heating in the winter. It does not work with all geologies. In some cases—for example, down in Kent—there is quite a lot of moving ground water that would just wash that energy away, but most of the geologies in the UK are perfectly suitable for energy storage in one way or another.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q107 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Graham Stringer:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You are in the business, so I am not surprised at that.

There have been some issues, I understand, with systems where they are trying to store energy in aquifers.

We see a longer period, and there are a number of elements to look at as well. There is a short period, a 20 to 30-day period, potentially feeding into building heat. We see base-load heat still feeding into industry and also the gas networks are required to feed into power generation, which is generating electricity, but also thermal heat that can feed into heat networks. When you look </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">at it as a balanced system, it comes out as more economic than removing that gas network and relying on electricity on its own. We have modelled this. We have worked with the Department of Energy and Climate Change and they have agreed with our modelling, and that is included in the heat strategy that came out in March this year. Their analysis is very similar to ours in that respect in saying that there is that longer-term role. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Not only that, there is a large amount of uncertainty between now and 2050.

There is the logistical challenge of removing people from that and forcing people to move to potentially higher-cost systems when there are options that will allow them to remain on the gas network. We should be looking at this in that broader piece and trying to do that balance between affordability, sustainability and security, which I mentioned earlier.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Christopher Pincher:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Maybe we should ask for Mr </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Sansom’s</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> model, so he can show us how he has come to his conclusions.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Donald Daw</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: May I add one quick comment?

I am not an expert, but I would think practically in the future there is no challenge to having a fully electrified heating system.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Marcus Stewart</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: You can get there. You would need to build an additional 50 GW of generation to supply that heat, if you think our peak demand today is around 65 GW. It comes down to the affordability and the economics of whether that is the right thing to do when you have a secure long-life asset that can supply that heat and provide that balance. Yes, you can get there. It becomes more expensive, and we are trying to look at sustainability and affordability.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Chris Davidson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I would like to make the point that that is largely dependent on the mix of ground and air source, because air source heat pumps, as we have already discussed, have that extra efficiency penalty just when you need it that ground source does not have.

That evidence suggests that heat pumps and heat networks both require ongoing Government interventions to encourage people to use those right out to 2050, compared to using a gas boiler. Even with increasing gas prices and even with a carbon price, there was still the requirement for some sort of intervention because of the costs of the new technologies. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In our future energy scenarios that we produce on an annual basis—there is a document here where we take the views across the industry, the electricity industry, the gas industry, consumer groups, technology providers—and with that analysis, we see roles for all types of technologies to get you to 2050, but it is a balance. Heat networks work well in commercial and some industrial situations. Heat pumps work well in some situations, particularly when you have a well insulated, low heat demand, and hybrids work better in other situations. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It is a balanced approach and that is what we are advocating, and it allows you then to move in a more cohesive way from where we are today to where we want to get to in 2050, rather than removing the gas network and building heat networks and effectively replacing an asset that is a long-life asset—by the time we get to 2050, it will be largely depreciated, so </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">its</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> running costs will be reduced—and rather than building a brand new asset.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Donald Daw</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: If I may add just one very small comment.

If you think of the investment that is required just to maintain the level of generation that we have today and replace the existing power stations, if you were to increase that by a factor of 50% or 100% additional amount that is a significant amount of generation. If we don’t go for a balance solution then you end up building generation to run for short periods of time and that becomes expensive in itself.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q115 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Albert Owen:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Successive Governments have talked about the future as electrification of surface transport and heating, so we are going to need that kind of investment and the customer is going to have to pay for it at the end of the day.

They are in the process of going through their price control. I think in the next eight years we are not seeing a significant amount of increased costs in that area because the view is that we are not going to have the impact of large amounts of electricity demand in the next eight years. In fact, our projections have shown electricity demand is reducing in the short term, but when you move out to beyond 2020 to 2030 or 2035 that is when you start to see an increase, when you have more electric heat pumps and potentially more electrification of transport. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There is a timing issue to this as well. At the moment, we do not foresee a huge amount of investment in meeting demand. The investment that is driven around the electricity network </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">from our perspective is connecting new sources of generation. That is what is largely driving our investment.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Chris Davidson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I would like to make the point that, within the timescales that Marcus is talking about there, improvements in control of the heat pumps, as we talked about earlier on, and more ground source rather than air source, as I have talked about earlier, mitigates a large amount of that extra generation capacity, certainly in my opinion and in our industry’s opinion.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Donald Daw</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: May I make one simple, practical comment? An air source or ground source heat pump, because we are supporters and manufacturers of both, would have a peak demand in a typical home with moderately good insulation of somewhere between 3 KW and 4 KW, not dissimilar to turning your kettle on. While I can’t comment on the mass infrastructure of the grid, if we allow people to boil their kettle when </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Coronation Street</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> or the football match ends then things do not collapse in the short term. If we had more intelligent control of consumption in the home, it would be possible, when we do our cooking or we turn the kettle on, to turn the heat pump down to a lower level. In a reasonably well insulated house, you could turn your heating off for an hour and not even notice. I think demand site control in the home and on the grid will play an equally important role as investment in more generating infrastructure, but that is from a one-off, simple, individual home application.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q116 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Just on the back of that, are the smart meters an important part of delivering that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Donald Daw</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Smart meters are a key first step, and once we understand what the communication protocol is going to be around the grid then we, as manufacturers, can develop our systems so that they can operate to facilitate that. I think it is a key part of it, but we still need further clarity.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Kelly Butler</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Can I make a point on the smart metering? We have talked about quite a lot of separate policies here that are all integrated, but there is no strategic method of bringing them together. In our submission to the inquiry we advocated the development of renewable heat zones and we put that forward for a reason, the reason being that we have a smart metering rollout that lends itself to the smart operation of heat pumps. The DNOs are just about to enter a new price control period in 2015 but not knowing where heat pumps are going to be, necessarily. It would help if they could identify clustering of heat pumps, so they could spend in their business plans exactly where the growth is coming. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We have antipathy in installer networks in the short term, “Should I get into renewable heat? I could put in an old boiler. I could put in a gas boiler,” and so on. There are quite a lot of different things that need to be brought together. Our view is that we need something a bit like we had for HECA Action back in the 1990s with the Home Energy Conservation Act where you have a local or a regional zone that has a three to five-year plan to say, “I’m going to have 50,000 heat pumps in this area,” for example. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">If I know that is going to happen, as an installer I am interested in paying money for the training and the MCS to get involved in that. If I am a DNO, I know that I am going to have to spend money on upgrading the network and then we do not get bill shocks from customers where they find that they are being charged £11,000 to connect to a heat pump, which is a substantial amount of money. The DNO picks that up in the price period. Manufacturers and local authorities can target their marketing.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We see ECO and the RHI and the Green Deal being targeted into these areas and also it helps the energy supply where they may be able to target time-of-use tariffs and the smart metering rollout emphasis as well. We are quite big advocates of that clustering approach and we think that can be achieved without that much Government support. We think industry can probably put that together through an independent trust and we have been in discussions with DECC and with one or two major energy suppliers about how we might be able to create that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Thank you very much for your evidence.

We had some issues with this right from the very start. The strategy seemed to be, and was, decarbonise electricity and then put everything on to electricity—that is heat, vehicles, the lot—and that carried with it a very big price tag. It did not at the time seem to take account of some of the issues that Marcus from National Grid was talking about, where you have a very concentrated amount of heat demand happening in a very short period of time: 20% of heat demand occurs in only 31 days of the year, and those 31 days of the year do not come neatly on 1 to 31 December. They all dot about and the thoughts of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">having sufficient electricity generation to meet that peak demand, particularly when you think back to December 2010—that was very cold and we saw our demand in our business leap by 50%.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That is 20% in a normal year. You go to a very bad winter, and as was being commented on earlier, it is only 11 days, but if that is 11 days or 20 days where your system does not work and you have no heating then there will be a big reaction. We have always argued that there needed to be a portfolio approach, and we are pleased to see that is what DECC have now started to talk</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> about in their latest iteration of</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, the heat strategy. They have gone away from pure electric play to one where you have scenarios where, even by 2050, and keeping within the carbon budgets, gas absorption heat pumps, for example, are the main technology, along with the hybrids and the heat pumps—a whole raft of stuff.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q119 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Are there any other views?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jim Lambeth</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes, I would totally agree. I think it would be foolish to have all your eggs in one basket, as the old saying goes. You have to have a spread of different energy sources because we have all seen the occasions when we have shortages in one direction or another. Perhaps we will come on to this later, but there is no question that many members of the public are concerned about the long-term strategies, about the security of supply, and certainly from our point of view—though I imagine my colleague to my right here would agree—people are demanding some sort of security whereby there has been a massive increase in demand for standalone space heating appliances in domestic residences because they are concerned on two counts, cost of fuel, thinking of gas and electricity, and security of supply.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Leese</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think a system approach probably means different things to different people.

The manufacturing sector already looks at a systems approach. Each manufacturing process is an internal system, and we recover and use a lot of waste heat from the process. We need to design buildings for long life.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We need to take a long-term view and a whole-life approach to buildings, but what we see is a regulatory and incentive system that is targeted towards the domestic sector and somewhat leaves the industrial sector behind.

We see the RHI targeting technologies and activities that my sector does not have access to and perhaps I could expand on that further later.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mike Mason</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think if we are going to look at a system approach, there are three big legs on this stool. The first is politics and we have the Climate Change Act that mandates an 80% cut by </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">2050. In</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> that context, the Climate Change Committee say, “Well, because there are unavoidable emissions that we can’t reduce—old coal mines and the like and some in agriculture—we are going to have to make 90% among the things we can do.” Then if you follow the Climate Change Committee’s recommendations on aviation and the Government’s policy of 2050 emissions the same as they were in 2005, what you have left for the domestic sector is 5% of what it currently is. That is the politics. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Let us look at the grid. In 2010, we consumed 440,000 GW—that is 440 </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">TWh</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—of heat. If you divide that by let us call it 2,000 hours a year, a quarter of the year heating—that is 12 hours a day six months of the year, in reality it is less—that is still, wait for it, 200 GW. The current generating capacity in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, with everything going full blast, is only 90.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Then you have to look at the house. Within the house what we have is an Anglo-Saxon hut with attitude. It has mud walls; it has sticks on the roof; and it was designed, by and large, to ventilate. The roof of a house is designed like an aerofoil. What we know, and what I know from personal experience of doing houses, is that houses suck air out. If you were to look at the correlation between wind speed and heat demand, I think you would find—and I have never been able to find the data—that it is huge. The great resource we have in this country is correlated with our greatest demand. It is heat.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The systems approach has to look at these three things. We are not talking about fiddling with a little bit here and a little bit there. We do not have the solution to the conundrum posed by the Climate Change Act. That is not to say we could not have the solution but, frankly, gentlemen, we do not have that solution at the moment and we have to stand back and say, “What do we want to achieve? What resources do we have? How do we integrate supply, demand and politics and take the holistic view?” Unfortunately, we do not do that very well.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q120 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> That is a good challenge to the inquiry.

None of these are my own costs. These are all derived from </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">quangos</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> or Government. The Energy Savings Trust reckon that to insulate a house properly to 2010-2020 standards, not to 2050 standards, costs between, at the low end, £9,000 and, at the high end, £20,000 per home. We have heard from the gentleman who is now behind about the cost of heat pumps, but let us set the cost of heat pumps aside. Heat pumps are going to be crucial in this story. By 2050, we will have about 33 million households. Let us not forget population growth, so 33 million households. We have 400 months. We have to do 30,000-odd homes a month. We will spend 1% of GDP insulating our homes, using the EST’s numbers, not mine. I think they are light, but that is a measure of the scale of money. The detailed numbers are in the evidence that I have submitted.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q121 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Albert Owen:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Most of what we have been discussing in this inquiry and with previous witnesses has been about the grid and the challenges for those that are on the grid, but even bigger challenges for those that are off-grid and in rural areas of the country. They are often paying more and they are often using more polluting fuels, so there is a great challenge there. What relative advantages of different heating solutions are there for the off-grid in terms of reducing carbon and economic costs?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jim Lambeth</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think if you approached the last part of that question about reducing carbon, undoubtedly the most useful methodology currently is burning wood—logs and the like. There is modern technology using wood pellets, for example, but the fuel itself is quite expensive and the appliances are very expensive. So the cost savings are minimal in the short term. Although this technology is out there in the marketplace and is all terribly attractive, in reality what most people do is resort to the good old-fashioned way of having a fire, whether it be an open fire or, more popular these days, a closed appliance—a stove with glass doors on the front—burning logs.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">This is a strange phenomenon, which most people can’t seem to get their heads around. We have been hearing so much about technology moving forward and ground source and air source and high efficiency condensing boilers, but the fact remains that the most popular appliance currently in our sphere is the wood-burning appliance. There is extraordinary demand from the public, and this flies in the face of all Government thinking about climate change and everything else. The fact is that Mr and Mrs Joe Public want, as I said earlier, security of supply. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It is a fact that during all the period of the economic crisis we have been going through—companies going to the wall and people suffering left, right and centre—there has been a boom in the sale and installation of these very appliances to the tune of, it is estimated, between 175,000 and 200,000 appliances a year. Pretty small beer compared to the size of the gas market but, nevertheless, a significant market and this has been growing year on year and it does not seem to be slowing down. We believe that the reason for this is one of cost. People perceive that it is—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Albert Owen:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Sorry, Mr Lambeth. They are moving from what fuel to—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jim Lambeth</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Not moving from; they are adding to. They have a house that is already centrally heated. The majority of houses in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> have central heating of some sort, with a few exceptions. They have central heating, whether it be gas, LPG or oil, in rural areas we are talking about now. Obviously, a number of those people, thankfully, use solid fuel—that is why I am here—but it is a fact that people are liking the notion of having a freestanding appliance in the sitting room that allows them to reduce their normal heating running costs, because if you light a fire in your living room the central heating—I will not say it shuts down, but it reduces the demand for heating in the property and invariably the running costs are considerably less. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Many of these modern appliances are now touching 80% or more efficiency, so they are pretty good by comparison. There are running costs. If you have access to cheap wood, so much the better. That reduces your costs still further. Overriding this, what I sense is that people are running scared of rising bills and concerns about security. We hear a lot of concerns about potential power cuts and so forth that may happen because the coal-fired power station is shutting in a couple of years’ time, and where the hell are they going to get to their electricity from? These are planned closures for which there is no solution. What is happening is that people are buying these appliances as a form of security, and they like them as well. It is a very attractive appliance that is nice to have in the house.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What seems to have happened is that people are having these to supplement what they already have for both causes, that is for security and to reduce their running costs. It is working. People are buying these things like there is no tomorrow. The </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> market has opened up to manufacturers from all over </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and installers and dealers are cropping up in every high street. The proof is in the pudding here. This is not speculation.

If they have access to the grid then all well and good, they can have a high-efficiency gas condensing boiler, but they obviously still like the additional. Of course, in rural areas they do not have that luxury, necessarily.

Let us just deal with wood, first of all. The UK’s total wood harvest in 2011 was 10 million green tonnes, 25 </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">TWh</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, 5% of our heat load, even if we took it all out of the uses it is currently put to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">to</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> put into houses. It is pretty. It is nice. I have them in my house, but it is not going to do anything to the nation’s heat problem. What you do not have in the rural areas is population density and so the cost of a gas grid per house is generally higher.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We know that we have to decarbonise heating, so it does not make sense to me to be investing massively in a more than averagely expensive distribution system for a heating system we know we are going to phase out. On the other hand, in the rural areas you do have a couple of things going for you. There is certainly some amount of wood. You have space. While ground source heat pumps are space consuming if you go for the slinky type thing—they are much less space consuming, clearly, if you go for vertical boreholes—you have space. You have options available. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">All of these people are on the grid. They face the greatest cost of heating at the moment and they are the place where we could do that most important thing in our heat planning, which is develop a market. I have built a few houses at near zero cover. I promise you that the architects do not know what they are doing, the M&amp;E people do not know what they are doing and the builders do not know what they are doing.

If we had a tonne of biomass here, it is incentivised via the Renewable Heat Incentive to put in a biomass boiler, whether that be a commercial boiler, an industrial boiler or a domestic boiler. The same tonne of biomass is incentivised to using power generation through renewable obligation certificates. The same tonne of biomass is not incentivised at all to be used in something like cement manufacture or lime manufacture or manufacturing industries that use direct heat. We have a disconnect in the policy system that is incentivising less efficient, potentially, uses of what is a scarce biomass resource.

They are already paying more for their fuel in the upfront costs. There is a problem there. That is why I suggest that Government should maybe be doing more, whether it is gas mains or whatever, in the interim, so they can move towards that as a transitional thing.

I can remember somebody telling me at the time that its investment strategy was that they were investing for their grandchildren. There was no economic analysis. It was a social expansion </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">grid. Of course, as soon as you separated those two out, you had a situation where you disconnected that ongoing revenue stream in terms of selling energy from establishing the grid in the first place. That is the first hurdle you would have to overcome, but that is an economic decision. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">You asked what the best thing is in terms of improving energy efficiency in off-grid </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Britain</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> now and, given that the vast majority of people use a boiler central heating system with radiators, you have to look at boiler replacement. Still 60% to 70% of boilers out there are F and G rated and probably the most successful carbon reduction and bill reduction programme in the past five years was the boiler </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">scrappage</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> scheme because that took 125,000 boilers out of the market early in the space of about three or four months.

There is a knock-on to the manufacturers.

The default position has been, “You need a renewable system, whether that is biomass or heat pumps,” and that inevitably carries with it a large capital cost. While I have been in the industry for almost 30 years, I have to acknowledge that heating is one of the most boring things on the planet and the general public do not think about heating every waking moment of their life. You only change a heating system either when it is costing you too much or usually when it is broken: 80% to 85% of heating system are distress purchases. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In terms of deploying newer technologies, you need to try to work much more in that model where they do not break down in the middle of June on a sunny day. It is in November and it is minus 5ºC and granny has come at the weekend or whatever. You need a quick solution. The problem where you set consumers this high bar is that then necessitates a whole raft of incentives that have to come behind it to try to support and make it economically viable, but you still can’t escape the fact that the sort of people that Mr Owen and all the members of the Committee are concerned about—people in fuel poverty—are not the people sat there with capital. These solutions are not available to them, and you can see that with the rollout of solar PV and the type of houses of the people that installed those.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jim Lambeth</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I would concur. The technology is there. Whether it be a pellet boiler, match-fired, wood-fired, whatever it is, they are very expensive pieces of kit and you rightly say, if you are talking about people in fuel poverty in rural areas, sorry, it is just beyond their reach. Despite the fact that this technology was heralded several years ago, the actual take-up of the biomass boilers, for example, has been extraordinarily low. I remember on occasions people quoting figures to me that were just pie in the sky and the reality is that they have not sold as many units as they would have liked to have done. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The factories are jolly expensive, plus you have to have a great deal of infrastructure in the house to be able to install these things. They are pretty big boilers in the main. They are fine for nursing homes and hotels, but in an average three-bedroom semi, I am sorry, it is not a feasible proposition. Yes, the technology is there, but it is almost too sophisticated and very expensive. It is an answer to the maiden’s prayer, but it is not achievable, as my colleague here says.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:21.8pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Leese</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I have mentioned why I think RHI is missing an opportunity in industry. There is considerable opportunity there to switch to biomass fuels. The Green Deal is focusing on energy efficient products and it fails to benefit systems that are for both a structural and thermal benefit.

The RHI is kind of there</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> but it is not because, going back to your opening question about systems, it encourages you</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in some respects, to have an inefficient house for which you are paid quite a lot of money. We have a house in the country, I hasten to add, and we get paid quite a lot of money for burning things inefficiently. I do not think it is pitched right, and it does not recognise the value of efficiency.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The Green Deal purports to do that</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> but it has two fundamental problems, in my book. The first is that everything you do under the Green Deal will be inadequate to meet the 2050 world that we have to be aiming at. That is born of practical experience</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> trying to do this in homes. Therefore</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> it is likely that everything you do will have to be—with the exception of cavity wall insulation—taken out and done again. This seems to me, were it to be successful, which </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">fortunately it is not, a great misallocation of public resources. The second thing about the Green Deal is that I do not think it will work because it imposes liabilities instead of giving people assets. If I take on a house with the Green Deal attached</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I do not know that it does not have the problems that a building I was recently involved with had, which is when I went in</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">to</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> the loft I found the insulation was there, it was all beautifully rolled up and had not been unrolled even. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There is nothing about the Green Deal that says the performance potential is being achieved. It is your point earlier about heat pumps. The missed opportunity here is around something which says, “Let’s create an asset</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">” and I will take for example mortgage interest relief for houses that achieve an objective standard of energy consumption. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I do not mind carbon; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I do not know how you balance that between electricity and efficiency.
