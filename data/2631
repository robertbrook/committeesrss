font-size:12pt">Whilst this proposal is consistent with the Government’s desire to promote localism and reduce bureaucracy, we believe that it fails to recognise both the particular and urgent need for the provision of additional accommodation for Gypsy / Roma / Traveller communities and the current slow progress of local authorities towards meeting that need.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Clause 21 as proposed states:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">(1) Section 87 of the Local Government Act 2003 (which confers powers on the Secretary of State, in relation to England and the Welsh Ministers, in relation to Wales, to require local housing authorities to have housing strategies and to prepare housing statements) ceases to have effect in relation to England.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Section 8 of the Housing Act 1985 </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">requires local authorities to consider the various accommodation needs of all local populations and to carry out periodic reviews in order to provide relevant and appropriate provision to meet these needs. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Section 8 (1) actually says:-</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';

font-size:12pt">that this is the case and that the duty to consider the "needs of the district" will still apply in the future, if local authorities are still carrying out such assessment work then we suggest it does not seem logical to discontinue the requirement to produce housing strategies and statements for reasons of public accountability at the very least. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Local Authorities were previously under a formal legal duty to provide sites for Gypsies and Travellers. This was established by the Caravan Sites Act 1968 which was a private members bill proposed by Eric Lubbock MP, now Lord Avebury. This piece of legislation was successful in causing a significant number of sites to be provided prior to the Act’s effective repeal as a result of measures contained within the Criminal Justice &amp; Public Order Act 1994. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Since 1994 the numbers of Gypsies and Travellers requiring authorised places to live or stop on far outweigh the number of authorised pitches available. Since Section 225 of the Housing Act 2004 was enacted along with other measures, there has been at least some positive progress in site provision, but the effect of Clause 21 of the Deregulation Bill would threaten such progress. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">According to the current most reliable figures, some 20% of the Gypsy and Traveller population in England who live in caravans reside on unauthorised encampments and unauthorised developments.  The simple reason why this occurs is that there is still inadequate provision of sites.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">It has been widely reported that the UN Special Rapporteur on Housing, following her recent visit to the UK, stated:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">In closing, let me also mention that during my visit I have also received multiple testimonies on the shortage of sufficient, adequate and safe sites for Gypsy and Traveller communities across the United Kingdom, many of whom feel this is part of the stigma and discrimination they regularly face from Governments and society as a whole. Despite multiple efforts and policies put in place to address this situation, it is fair to say that leaving local authorities to make their own decision with no accountability and national process to reconcile the Gypsy and Traveller settled communities remains a source of concern.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The Government’s current planning policy, </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Planning policy for traveller sites</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">, states that every local authority should already have in place a five year deliverable supply of sites. We would suggest that virtually no local authorities have such a supply in place within their Local Plan.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">We also suggest that this means that not only should there continue to be proper local housing strategies in place but also there should be on-going Government involvement to ensure that sites are provided, otherwise history has shown that local authorities will not provide the necessary sites.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">In summary then, we </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">foresee considerable issues with Clause 21 and ask that it be removed from the Bill.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">September 2012</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
