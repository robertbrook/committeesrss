Executives at Channel 4 were heard to remark that if the launch of BBC3 was designed to attract more young adults to television, it would make mor</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">e sense to hand the new channel’s budget</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> to Channel 4, </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">which had an establish</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">ed track record in appealing to those viewers.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Likewise, a proposal to launch local TV stations was vetoed by the BBC Trust, which has also imposed limits on the extent of the BBC’s online activities.

In truth, with BBC 3 and BBC 4 only available in the evenings, and with BBC2 </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">confined to repeats in daytime – other than when it is offering live broadcasts – the scale of the BBC’s television offerings is more show than substance. Indeed, when Lord Hall launches a +1 service for BBC1, he will further enlarge the nominal number of </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">hours of transmission, without delivering a single additional programme. Yet the appearance of growing scope and scale can in itself be dangerous, especially when there is a real and serious issue in a key area.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">That area is news consumption. I have raised</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> this point with the parallel committee in another place, so I will not re-run all the numbers. The fact is that the BBC is re</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">sponsible for over 60% of all news consumption by UK adults, a figure that edges higher year by year, as newspaper readership decl</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">ines and TV news consumption shifts steadily away from ITV and towards the BBC.
