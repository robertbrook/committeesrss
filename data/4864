He claims the UK was unlawfully involved in this. As this matter is the subject of ongoing civil litigation I cannot comment on the issue at this stage beyond saying that the Government has denied any wrongdoing or unlawful acts. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt; font-weight:bold">TPIM breaches and prosecutions </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">4. Ms Scarnell asked for details of TPIM breaches and prosecutions. Six people have been charged with breaching their TPIM notices, some more than once: </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">Mohamed himself was charged on two separate occasions – in December 2012 with six counts of failing to report to the police station or reporting late (awaiting trial at time of abscond) and in July 2013 with one count of tampering with his tag (case discontinued after CPS concluded there was no realistic prospect of conviction). As noted in Annex A, he was also charged with 14 counts of breaching his Control Order. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">One person pleaded guilty to three counts of breaching - broadcasting without permission, attending a meeting or gathering without permission and entering an internet cafe without permission. He was sentenced to nine months imprisonment on 21 June 2013. Charges in relation to a further three counts were allowed to lie on file following his guilty plea. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">One person was charged with five counts of entering an excluded area without permission.

You asked whether any of the control order absconds were connected with a mosque. One control order subject, who absconded in 2007, was last seen at a mosque. There is no evidence to indicate that any of the other six individuals subject to Control Orders absconded from mosques. One person is believed to have escaped from a window of West Middlesex Hospital; three who were not tagged, disappeared sometime after making a routine report to a police station; one who was tagged disconnected an electronic monitoring unit and cut off his tag at his home before disappearing; and one disappeared during the short window between one control order being quashed and a new control order being served against him on the same day. Control Order subjects did not have GPS tags. One of the purposes of the new tag is to provide reassurance of an individual’s location and monitor his compliance with measures which restrict his movement. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt; font-weight:bold">Passports belonging to TPIM subjects </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">6. All the TPIM subjects are prohibited by their measures from possessing or taking any steps to obtain a passport. All passports of TPIM subjects, other than that of Mohamed, are accounted for and are in the possession of the police. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">7. Mohamed was issued with a British passport on 28 April 2005. When he was deported to the UK he did not have this passport with him, so there was no passport for the police to seize. The whereabouts of this passport are unknown. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt; font-weight:bold">Mohamed’s citizenship </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">8. Mohamed entered the UK, aged three, with his mother on 12 June 1989. His mother claimed asylum on her and her children’s behalf on 29 July 1989. The family were recognised as refugees on 30 October 1989 and granted four years leave to remain. They applied for indefinite leave to remain on 20 September 1993, which was granted on 28 April 1994. Mohamed and his family were naturalised as British citizens on 23 November 1999, when he was aged 13. Under Somalia nationality law Mohamed automatically lost his Somali citizenship when he became British. He is therefore a UK mono-national. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt; font-weight:bold">Mohamed’s deportation from Somaliland </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">9. As this matter is currently the subject of ongoing civil litigation I cannot provide any details further to what I told the Committee. However, I can confirm that documents relating to Mohamed's deportation from Somaliland were disclosed during open session in the TPIMs proceedings by both the Government and Mohamed's lawyers. These documents are not in the public domain. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">10. You asked why Mohamed was allowed to return to the UK. Section 1(1) of the Immigration Act 1971 exempts from immigration control persons who have the right of abode. This means that there is no legal basis for preventing British citizens, like Mohamed, from returning to the UK, whatever the circumstances of their return and whatever their activities abroad. Where someone is a British citizen, it is not therefore necessary for a foreign government to request that we take them back. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt; font-weight:bold">Deportation of suspected terrorists to the UK </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">11. You asked about the number of people who have been detained overseas for terrorism offences, who were not prosecuted, and were then deported back to the UK. I cannot yet give you a definitive answer to this question. I have asked officials to work with the police and their network of Counter Terrorism and Extremism Liaison Officers (CTELOs) to collate the information which we expect to send you in early December. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt; font-weight:bold">The possible prosecution of TPIM subjects for terrorist offences </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">12. You asked whether Mohamed or other TPIM subjects could have been prosecuted were it not for sensitivities around evidence being produced in open court. For each TPIM case, under section 10 of the TPIM Act 2011, the CPS review all material held by the relevant agencies in order to determine whether there is evidence available that could realistically be used for the purposes of prosecuting the individual for an offence relating to terrorism. This review is, of course, conducted according to existing evidential rules and does not address a hypothetical situation where secret intelligence material could be used as evidence. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">13. The CPS have told me that it is not possible to say, on a case-by-case basis, how such a hypothetical situation would affect the prospects of prosecution because the evidential rules that would apply in such a situation are, by definition, unknown. However, to help the Committee, I have asked the CPS to give their overall opinion of what difference the use of secret evidence might make to their ability to prosecute TPIM subjects. The CPS are considering this and I will write to you soon with the results. I would note in the meantime para 7.15 of David Anderson’s 2012 TPIM report (published March 2013) which states: “I asked the CPS to tell me whether their decisions not to charge any of the 10 TPIM subjects would have been different had intercept evidence been admissible in criminal proceedings. Having consulted the relevant case lawyers, they advised me, without confirming whether or not such material existed in any case, that their charging decision would have remained the same in each of the 10 cases”. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt; font-weight:bold">Communications data </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">14. You asked me to provide further data on the breakdown of requests for communications data, particularly with reference to GCHQ. This data is collected and collated by the Interception of Communications Commissioner. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">15. The Commissioner’s 2012 Annual Report stated that there had been 570,135 requests for data that year. It is not possible to identify accurately the number of people to which these requests relate. The reason for this is that at the time of an application for data and subsequently it is often not clear to law enforcement agencies how many people are using a single phone or indeed who the „owner‟ of it might be. Members of criminal gangs and terrorist groups do not own a single phone like the rest of us. Phones are frequently shared and then disposed of very quickly. As I said in the Committee session, the requests will therefore relate to a significantly lower number of investigations and people – some investigations involve many hundreds of requests, many relating to the same person. The Joint Committee on the Draft Communications Data Bill, which reported in December 2012 described (in appendix 4 to the report) a case where 500 applications were made for different types of data relating to just five people. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">16. The Commissioner’s report outlines that 99% of total requests come from law enforcement and the security agencies. This includes police forces across the UK, the Serious and Organised Crime Agency (now part of the National Crime Agency), HM Revenue and Customs, the former UK Border Agency and the intelligence agencies </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">(MI5, SIS and GCHQ). The remaining 1% relate to requests from other public authorities; the vast majority are from the Financial Services Authority (now the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority) and local authorities. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">17. The Joint Committee on the Draft Communications Data Bill recommended that more detailed information should be collated about communications data requests. The Home Office is keen to improve the public information on how communications data is used to support law enforcement investigations. We have consulted the Interception of Communications Commissioner on what additional statistics could be collected that would add value to his annual report to the Prime Minister. We are looking at a number of data categories such as the types of crime being investigated and the number of applications which are rejected (or where further work is required) at each stage of the process. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">18.
