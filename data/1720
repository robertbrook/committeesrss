Because it has been poorly done the take up has been limited.

It’s the number plus the explanation of where it comes from, how it’s generated, how that has changed over time, the caveats, definitions and what it can and can’t be compared to. Openness about all this context is a big part of what makes official statistics trustworthy. The Committee illustrated that powerfully in a recent report: what’s the use of knowing the net migration figure without knowing that it’s only accurate to +/- 34,000? Or having an opinion survey without knowing the sample size? Or a headline measure of crime without knowing it doesn’t include murder?
