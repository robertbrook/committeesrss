Can I begin with you, Mr Fisher? We have seen a lot of volatility in response to the tapering announcement by the Fed. Is that a harbinger of what we might see when the MPC decides to unwind QE?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Fisher</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think it has been quite an instructive episode, although not exactly the same as would happen in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> case. Among the things that it demonstrates is, first of all, the pre-eminence of US dollar markets in financial markets generally, so when there is a risk off scenario like this, you see assets being sold off across the board, so it was not just interest rates but equities, emerging market assets and so on. So, those </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">spillovers</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> from the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> to the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> mean that I suspect we will continue to get volatility as the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> exits from its QE. I do not think we would get the same </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">spillovers</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> to international markets from the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. It demonstrates some other things: first of all, the importance of communication. I think the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> markets had got very much one way round of what the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> would do, so it demonstrates that you do need to be clear and transparent about what your policies are going to be.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In fact, volatility has not been particularly high over the last couple of months. It has come up from what was a very low compressed level to something that across markets, across those couple of months, has been about average, and so we could easily see more volatile periods than this in the months to come. It also illustrates the way that the financial markets are forward-looking, so small bits of news about policy can cause quite sharp reactions. So, I think all of those points are very instructive about what exit might be like, but I shouldn’t think we would get the same international </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">spillovers</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q280 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Could you speak up, Mr Fisher?

I was in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">New York</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in early April, and I was quite struck how everybody was one way round. They all thought the exit from QE would be very smooth and that the Fed would tell them everything that was going to happen well in advance. Nobody was hedging the possibility of upward movements in rates because they had all lost money trying to do that over the previous couple of years. So, I was quite struck. It occurred to me then that the market was ripe for some volatility to occur when news came in. Of course you cannot predict what or when that news will be, so it was quite interesting how much it moved just on the back of Bernanke’s comments.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q281 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Just to be clear, your reply is the markets incorrectly priced the yield curve, prior the announcement, by suggesting that yields were lower than they should have been?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Fisher</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Lower for longer, yes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q282 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair: </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">They were right to adjust, which has been an adjustment of what, about 100 basis points?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Fisher</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes. I wouldn’t say I am sure the current level is in the right place. I think it will take a while. What happened was we saw a big unwind of positions from leveraged money, hedge funds and the like, who had taken these lower for longer positions. That caused a general risk-off scenario. We are now seeing the market starting to try to find new levels for financial market prices. I am not sure that adjustment has fully worked through yet, but they were right to re-price and we will have to wait and see whether or not they get to a more sensible level. My contacts are saying this is a sensible correction, to put some two-way risk back into the market.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Mr </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Stheeman</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, do you have anything you want to add or disagree with, if you want?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Stheeman</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I agree very much with a lot of points that Paul made, but I would also say that I do not believe that the markets are necessarily right or wrong. I think it is always unwise to ascribe to markets any particular wisdom or lack of wisdom. They react purely to news that they have out there in the open, which is why Paul’s comments about communication is so key for the future. It could easily be that the markets are not doing what one would expect them to do, but I am always a little bit cautious about saying, “The market is wrong and therefore we have it right, but we are being misunderstood”. I always think that that is slightly sort of dangerous.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q283 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You gave the impression that you agree with most of what Mr Fisher says.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Stheeman</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Absolutely.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So, there must have been something you disagree with.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Stheeman</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The markets had indeed brought yields across the globe down quite a bit, certainly here in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, in particular in the major liquid Government bond markets. For that to have happened, there was a consensus of view that also the economic conditions, the reaction functions of central banks were such that it necessitated very low yields. I think that that was arguably at the time perfectly justified, but where I completely agree with Paul is that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">the recent move—although it was a very sharp move, and I would say quite an unpleasant move for many market participants—is one that seems to reflect the current conditions much more appropriately.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q284 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Newmark</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> This is to Robert. Are you worried that when the Bank starts to unwind QE, the market might be flooded with gilts and you will struggle to issue?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Stheeman</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is extremely hard for me to envisage exactly the situation we are going to find ourselves in when the Bank decides to unwind. That worry would be greater if I knew now that the Bank would do so in a very forceful, potentially even uncontrolled fashion in a non-programmatic way. Then I would be seriously worried. I have always felt that the market is deep and liquid enough, or should be deep and liquid enough, to be able accommodate sales certainly by the Government, but also potentially by the Bank, if necessary, at the same time. Having said that, we can’t offer any guarantees that that price adjustment process would be smooth. I think that the events in markets over the last few weeks underline the point that just the merest hint in the US—not even the UK, but the US—what they refer to as “tapering” can mean that price movements are going to be exceptionally sharp and they can cause volatile markets.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q285 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Newmark</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you think the US has perhaps taken the sting out of the tail by seeing the reaction, and has that adjusted the way you are going about your scenario planning and messaging then, given what you have said?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Stheeman</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: As far as taking the sting out of the tail for markets, quite possibly, yes, it may well have done. Again, it is worth noting that the market movements over the last few weeks have been driven by the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. The </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> remains the leading Government bond market and it is instructive just how correlated our individual bond markets really are. In terms of our own behaviour as a result of that, nothing changes. It is in the nature of debt management, and it is in the nature of our strategy and operations, that we stick to the plans that were in existence at the time of the Budget when we received our remit. So, we are not changing anything.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q286 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Newmark</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You might have to change something if yields become unsustainable, and I guess is there a yield at which selling does become unsustainable?

The </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Autumn Statement</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is the obvious one. In general, we try to have long-term plans to which we stick, and, when you say that yields might become unsustainable, if yields have to rise, if yields rise as a result of even expectations around QE sales, let alone the sales themselves, that could be a positive for us in terms of being able to sell what we have to sell, because it will draw in buyers at higher yields. Effectively, that is the market efficiently pricing in our issuance as well to take that down in an orderly fashion.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q287 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Newmark</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Paul, you are going to have to speak up because I have a bad head cold, so I cannot hear anything. The MPC has said it will raise the Bank Rate before it </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">unwinds QE. Once it begins raising interest rates, how will it decide at what point to unwind QE?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Fisher</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I should say this is not a commitment that is what we will do. This is our presumptive plan at the moment. We think it is most likely that we would increase interest rates first and then we would look to return our system to reserves averaging, although that is a decision under review. Then we would start to sell assets but, first of all, it would have to be consistent with what monetary policy we wanted to achieve. For example, we wanted to tighten conditions. We would only start when we thought we could maintain a programme of sales for a good long period. What we do not want to do is sell one month, stop, buy some more, sell another month, so we would want a good long programme of gilt sales. We have suggested perhaps six months’ worth at a time—although it would take us a lot longer than six months to unwind—but that is really the conditions where we could set out a programme of sales to give the market some certainty to try to maintain orderly conditions.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q288 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Newmark</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> But markets are smart and, when they see that happening and they see the signal come, they will respond accordingly, and you could get a movement in the market that doesn’t necessarily mean you end up effectively getting a reasonable market price, because it will have anticipated that move.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Fisher</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: This is why it is a presumptive plan. First of all, we would give the signal that policy was going to be tightened through changing interest rates. You would then see what the market reaction was. That may give you quite a tightening in monetary policy, and so you may then want to delay asset sales for some time. If you thought you needed to do more tightening, then you would have two instruments you could play with, in terms of interest rates and sales. Our presumption is that the active instrument of policy would be interest rates, and we would try to get asset sales on to a sustained platform over a period of time to give some certainty to the market about how much would be sold back into the market over that period.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q289 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Newmark</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Robert, what are your thoughts on that, particularly what effect will the decision to raise the Bank Rate have on your ability to issue those gilts?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Stheeman</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I wholeheartedly endorse the notion of a programmatic, rules-based approach to any sales. It is the same thing that we do in our own sales when we are selling gilts and it is the one that the market finds the easiest to prepare for, to adjust accordingly in order to avoid unnecessary volatility as much as possible. So, I wholeheartedly endorse that. Exactly what is going to happen when rates do rise is incredibly hard to predict, but I would also agree with Paul’s premise, namely the chances are that, even before the Bank Rate itself is raised, you will have seen a movement in yields. If you look at what has happened in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> markets again over the last few weeks, that is a classic example of the market discounting well in advance of an event that has not yet happened. They are trying to assume what is going to be the case when it happens, and I think the same applies here. My guess is that before the Bank raises rates, you will have seen yields move up.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q290 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Newmark</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> But didn’t you see it as slightly ironic that Bernanke was effectively saying, “Hey, things are going fairly well economically.

To be clear, I would not want to leave the Committee with the impression that I don’t think that there is a risk there. There is a real risk, but I would also say that rising rates are not necessarily only a bad thing. As you have implied, they are a sign of potential growth in the economy, that the market expects that. Also, that growth environment is normally associated—this is not a prediction; it is just looking at the past—with better public finances, which themselves could potentially hint at a smaller borrowing requirement by Government, so all of those things work together. But is there a risk? Absolutely, and I want to acknowledge one point: the events of the last few weeks suggest that the withdrawal of the stimulus by monetary policy authorities globally, that process, the associated market movements are going to be uncertain. The consequences of that are very uncertain, and I don’t think we should pretend otherwise.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q291 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Newmark</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> If I just finish on my last question, I like to make sure that whatever we do on the Committee relates to our constituents, so that ordinary people understand that, a lot of times we do a lot of technical talk and jargon.

As interest rates become more normalised—and as I said, there could be a sudden move up in yields—do you share my concern that those of our constituents that have been sucked into buying houses with relatively low mortgages, who have ended up borrowing at fairly low rates to keep their businesses going, could be hurt by this?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Stheeman</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Absolutely.

If you observe the banks, it takes about a year or so for a bank to fully pass through changes in its funding rates to lending for businesses and households. That is one of the reasons why the Funding for Lending Scheme is taking so long to have its full effect work through. So, if there is just a spike, I don’t think that will </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">affect businesses and households very quickly.

Those are the conditions under which we would want to tighten policy. We would want to slow credit growth down in those conditions, and so hopefully the conditions under which we would be doing this are ones where those effects will be desirable.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q295 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Newmark</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So, the implication of your answer, then, is it looks like this unwinding is unlikely to happen at least for a couple of years.

The scandal of the LIBOR rigging is still very fresh in people’s minds. So, Mr Fisher, I would like to ask you whether you consider that—along with now an investigation into potential oil price-fixing—there has potentially been rigging of gilt auctions. Specifically on 10 October 2011, an auction of gilts was cancelled because of fears that the price was moving in some manipulated way. Do you consider that there has been manipulation of gilt-edged auctions?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Fisher</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: No. In all our operations, we think very hard about how the market participants might behave and we try to design operations to account for that. We spend a lot of time looking at what happens and talking to market participants afterwards, and we always reserve the right to not complete an operation if we think something untoward has happened. On that particular occasion, the auction wasn’t cancelled, the auction went ahead, but we did not allocate any purchases to one particular bond that was being offered to us, whose price had gone up very substantially in the market that morning against the run of the market trend. On that occasion, our methods demonstrated that there was something to be concerned about and we took the appropriate action and the market generally welcomed that. But we do pay a lot of attention to those sorts of market moves. That was taken as a shot across the bows.

Part of the design of the operation was that rather than buy one gilt at a time, we bought from a selection of gilts. So, on that particular one there were 10 gilts, and we know it is possible to squeeze one gilt in the market in that fashion—if that is what happened—but it is not possible to squeeze 10. So, it was very obvious to us here what was happening. One gilt was moving not just inconsistent with the market, it was moving in the opposite direction to all of the other gilts in the market. So, there was a clear signal. The design of the operations was done intentionally to show up that sort of adverse movement.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">So, we have looked at it.

So, we have a lot of discussions going on in the background, but this was the first case where we had seen something where I was sufficiently concerned not to proceed with allocating against that particular bond.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q306 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrea </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Leadsom</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So, your belief was that the market was being deliberately manipulated?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Fisher</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There was that risk.

I suppose we regard reverse auctions as carried out by the Bank as similar to our own operations, which by their very nature are competitive. I think Paul made an interesting point when he said that their reverse auctions, as opposed to our direct auctions, are fundamentally different in that a whole array of stocks can potentially be offered. I would also point out though that the ability exists to reject some of those offers, if that was felt correct, and that is exactly what happened. But to go back to the point, the auction process by definition is a competitive one. I am talking now about our own auctions and it is a relatively transparent one, where effectively we—and the Bank does the mirror thing—put into the market a block of paper to be sold to primary dealer gilt-edged market makers all at one time at 10.30am, and there is a competitive process whereby no bidder knows what another bidder is doing.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q313 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrea </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Leadsom</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You think; you assume?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Stheeman</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We think, we assume; you are right.

I can’t. What I am saying is that we have absolutely no evidence that our gilt auctions are in any way subject to any sort of—what I call—bad or even illegal market practice at all.

That was clearly something where I believe at the time the Bank identified a certain specific behaviour around a single stock, among many, that they felt that they could reject. There is one thing—again, a parallel that we have—which is important. That is that when we sell gilts in our auctions, we also have an element of discretion. That discretion is, if necessary, if we felt that we were receiving bids that were somehow in any way of not good quality but were somehow tainted—for want of a better word—we would look at that very carefully, in the same way as the Bank did with their reverse auctions. But again, nobody can offer cast-iron guarantees. I don’t know what the outcome of this particular situation with the Bank was, but it was not the entirely same process as our own auctions.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Fisher</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Can I just add one point, which is that the difference with LIBOR is that the LIBOR rates were not observable. Essentially the Banks were making the rates up to put them into the LIBOR submissions. In the gilt market prices are continuously available, so the advantage we have is we can observe how the pricing is changing. If we think the pricing going into our operations isn’t fair, we can then take action about that, so it is much more transparent than the interbank lending market.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q317 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrea </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Leadsom</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I would have to disagree with that.

We operate at arm’s length, but we are just a fundamental part of the Treasury and we receive, as you are aware, every year a gilt sales remit. We can give comments to colleagues in the Treasury and we can, when we meet with—I do quite regularly, often on an informal basis—colleagues in the Bank of England. We can offer views on a number of things, but of course where those views cut across, for instance, issues of monetary policy, they are—and that is the institutional governance framework that we have—quite rightly the preserve of the Bank of England and the Monetary Policy Committee.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Nothing has changed there.

We will meet. However, it is important to understand that the institutional setup has been created in such a way as deliberately to keep debt management and debt management policy implementation separate from monetary policy. So, to a certain extent, there is a conscious and deliberate decision in the setup under which we have to operate to keep those two areas apart. That does not mean that we will not talk at times about operational issues, which we have any number of them, but there is no formal process.

I understand what you are saying. If I may make one point about the institutional setup, about the separation and about the fact, arguably indeed, that we do not have any influence ourselves on how monetary policy might be implemented, is that that separation is part of the credibility of the overall framework. That credibility is incredibly important to the markets. Because if the markets felt that—and I think this is key in relation to the size of the task that we do indeed have—actually to be nice to us, the Bank of England, the Monetary Policy Committee, would make decisions, for instance around QE, which might be beneficial for Government finances, then all sorts of wider questions around the credibility, around perhaps some kind of underhand monetary financing of Government, could in theory arise. That is why I think, in order to avoid that, the current institution setup is actually rather a good one. It does not allow that to happen. We derive benefit from the market as a result, because the market believes that there is no collusion between ourselves and the Bank around monetary policy implementation.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q340 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mudie</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> If that expert was right, he then projected it further forward and thought the markets would turn and we would have terrible trouble raising cash, and very expensive trouble.

One of the things I did try to make clear at the beginning is a lot of this is hugely uncertain. I think I may have said this to the Committee previously but I repeat it. We cannot force people to buy gilts. For that reason, all the debt management strategies that we employ are designed to facilitate the sale of gilts as much as possible. The gilt market is a very open one, it is a very deep one, it is a very liquid one, therefore all our strategies have to be aligned to that market structure; they have to be designed to support market liquidity as much as possible, which we believe is the strongest guarantee that we will be able to fulfil our remit of raising the cash that we need to raise to fund Government.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q342 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">John </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Thurso</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Can I come to you, Paul? During the course of discussing QE on various occasions, a number of colleagues have asked various representatives of the Bank what the impact is on the ordinary citizen. Broadly speaking, there have been a bit of winners, a bit of losers. The Governor explained on one occasion that those who had financial assets were doing better than those that needed them and so on. Has the Bank undertaken any formal assessment of the impact of QE on citizens generally, or does it confine itself to looking at the impact on the market?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Fisher</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We focus on the impact of QE on economic aggregates as a whole, so output, inflation, unemployment, and that is our main focus in terms of setting out monetary policy. Of course we did produce for this Committee a review of the effect on pensions, as that was a particular issue. It is always the case that monetary policy changes have distributional impacts. You are moving income and incentives between savers and borrowers. That is what monetary policy does when we change interest rates.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I think what you are seeing here is that sometimes there are things, which are second or third order effects of the operations, that become important when the operations are just so big.

There is nothing in our remit that means we should go and look at distributional effects. We can do that if somebody particularly asks us to, subject to resources. Where we do dig down a bit is we do look at what happens regionally, through our regional agents’ network. We do look at what happens to different sectors of the economy, because that can have a big impact. So, those things where we think it may affect the overall macro economic impact, we are digging down into the details. For example, you have to look at what happens to household debt, to assess what happens to household income and expenditure. We know different groups within that will be in different positions. So, there is a certain amount of digging down you have to do, but it is all funnelled into getting that overall assessment of what is going to happen to inflation and output and unemployment.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q345 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">John </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Thurso</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> When he came before us, Andy Haldane used the phrase that the Bank has “intentionally blown the biggest government bond bubble in history”, which I am sure you all enjoyed as much as we did.

It would seem to me, that could </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">move the decision-making from being a purely independent Monetary Policy Committee decision into being something of a political decision. So, the two-edged question is: is it right that the MPC should be involved in taking what are quasi political decisions? It may be, it may not be.

Of course, we have the remit from the Government that sets out what they expect us to do and how they expect us to do it, and that has recently been revisited and expanded somewhat. So, I think that is something we just have to get on and do. Making monetary policy is always political, with a small “p”. What it isn’t anymore is party-political, and so we should not be put under pressure to change interest rates for party-political reasons.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">But of course it affects people’s lives. That is the whole point about monetary policy, you are trying to improve the economic outcomes for the country in terms of keeping inflation low, employment up and unemployment down. That has to be political. But the decision has been taken to delegate the technical decision of setting monetary policy to the committee, subject to the remit from Government. We think that is the right way to do it. The remit from the Government is very important for us to give us that political legitimacy, and the accountability before this Committee is very important, so we have to come and explain ourselves and what we are doing and the various measures of transparency we have.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q347 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">John </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Thurso</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> If you refer back to the answers you gave to Brooks </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Newmark</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and the questions that he was putting, it is very much about: what is going to happen to the small business? What is going to happen to the individual mortgage holder? It seems to me that there is a potential risk that, when we start unwinding QE, the market reactions are a bit more complex than we perhaps envisage and the effect on the economy is not quite what it might have been. The net result is it puts people who have a lot of debt, in those circumstances, under a degree of pressure that might not have been foreseen. In that circumstance, it seems to me that there is an open invitation to the Chancellor of the day, and the Government of the day, to reassess that. Has any thinking has been going on in that regard?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Fisher</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think the important thing is they have to set the remit annually and they have to set it publicly. If the Government want us to change tack on policy, they can tell us but they have to do so publicly, and there would be consequences for that if they diverged from a remit that had inflation as its primary goal.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q348 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">John </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Thurso</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> If we look at the pre-crash days where you had your remit, which was an inflation target, and you had interest rates as the basic weapon and the interest rate moved to achieve the target. That entire process, once the target for inflation had been made, had been totally outsourced and was independent and the best academics came to the view. So, we got where we wanted without—as you rightly said—the party politics taking place. If we are now in a position where what you are saying is it is no longer that simple, and there are sufficient impacts that you may need to change your remit on an annual basis, has not the independence of monetary policy been, at least in part, repatriated to the Treasury?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Fisher</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think the remit we have—it was fit for purpose before, and it has been improved—gives us the flexibility to do what we need to on the exit strategy. It can’t be in the interests of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> economy to suddenly put a shock into the system, which means that people with large debts all go bust and their firms or households suddenly become completely broke, because you would kill the economy in your tracks. So, you do want to have a relatively </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">smooth path for policy. However, we can’t predict what the reactions in the markets might be, so some of this will be to do it and feeling it as we go along. We can put interest rates up. If there is too big a reaction, we can take interest rates down again. Unwinding asset sales is a bit more problematic than that. We would want to do it on a smooth basis, but we will have to suck it and see a bit on the exit strategy for monetary policy, depending on what the reaction is. Our focus will be on maintaining steady growth and low inflation, and if we saw the economy start to slow down disproportionately, we would have to take action to prevent that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q349 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Ruffley</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Mr Fisher, I would like to have some questions, to have another go around the block on the subject of: might there be a loss when we get to unwinding? McLaren and Smith in the Q1 </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Quarterly Bulletin</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> this year paint a picture that is eminently plausible. I am going to read out for the record, to explain why there could well be a loss, and I am quoting from them, “Because the price of all the gilts held is assumed to fall when gilt sales are announced”, i.e. the unwinding, “the gilts are sold for a lower price (over and above the extent to which this would occur anyway as a result of the gilts being purchased ‘above par’). HMT makes transfers to the APF to cover this shortfall. Again, where possible, cash in the APF is used to make up this shortfall, with the remainder being transferred from HMT. But because the portfolio gets smaller as sales continue, the amount of coupons received also starts to fall, and therefore so does the amount of cash available to make up the shortfall: that is why the size of the transfers from HMT increases over time. This continues until the entire portfolio is sold”. That is the end of the quote. They come to the conclusion on their major scenario that the cash transfer from HMT to the Asset Purchase Facility could amount to £8 billion. Now, isn’t that a loss to the public sector?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Fisher</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: No, I don’t think so.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q350 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Ruffley</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Why not?

What happens with asset purchases is we have built up a very substantial portfolio and a very substantial mark to market positive position. Some of that is in the form of cash, which has been given to the Treasury to manage. But that cash will be due back in the APF as the thing unwinds.

But you have used the words “openness” and “transparency”, which is why I want to get back to this concept of whether or not there could be a loss.

Most of those paths—even taking quite extreme assumptions—give you a positive position at the end of the thing. But it is a scenario, there are probabilities attached, and you can certainly take possibilities in the tail that would give you a negative position.

But why I don’t call it a loss—let me just explain. Robert does a very, very good job at the DMO and makes decisions with the Government all the time about how to fund the Government’s debt. Those decisions have different cost implications and they result in different cash flows to and from the public sector. We don’t think of changes in those decisions as generating a profit and loss. It is just the different cost of funding the Government debt. It happens all the time in a regular way. Effectively, what we are doing is something similar to that. Potentially there will be a cost involved but you would not think of it as a profit and loss. The question is: does it benefit the public finances? I would say it will be a huge benefit because we will have generated more tax revenue and cut unemployment spending by boosting the economy.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Ruffley</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal"> Understood.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q358 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It is really a case of debt management?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Fisher</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There is an aspect of this which is close to debt management.

I am arguing that the profit and loss concept does not really fit in this discussion.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Well, at that point I will bring in Mark </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Garnier</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> who is struggling to keep quiet.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q364 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mark </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Garnier</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I am struggling to get my head around what you are saying. You have two very, very simple elements to this asset purchase scheme. You have the capital side of it and the interest side of it. The interest side of it washes itself through because, of course, the Government is currently paying out 229 basis points gross redemption yield, which is then coming into you. You are then paying it, so that cancels itself out effectively.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Fisher</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: No, it is coming to us instead of going to the market.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q365 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mark </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Garnier</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes, okay, so it is coming to you but it is an income to you. The Government has got it out. But effectively the big picture thing washes itself through. The capital side of it, though, so the purchase of the capital—so ignore the gross redemption yield, just take the capital side of it—you buy gilt when you are trying to reduce interest rates, so you </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">are buying a gilt at, say, 300 basis points yield. Sorry, you are buying gilt to push up the prices, so you are buying it at the lower yields and when you are unwinding it you are selling it at the higher yields, therefore it is lower capital prices.

With gilt sales we really need to be programmatic, so it is just a question of which can you change with the most frequency? It seems to us that it would be better to give the signal with interest rates first.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I come back to the point I made earlier. This isn’t a commitment. This is a presumptive plan that the committee have had. In future there will be different committee members. We have a new Governor now. That plan could change, but the expectation is still that we would change interest rates first to give the signal, and then we would sell gilts when we could do so in an orderly fashion.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q381 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mark </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Garnier</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> This also comes back to Brooks </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Newmark’s</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> point about forward guidance and trying to warn people what is going to go on. It is quite interesting when it comes to unwinding the QE process, because you are obviously managing the increase in the debt for </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">the Government. Then, of course, at some point you are going to be competing against the Bank of England who will be pushing gilts into the marketplace.

You would see a significant move upwards in that part of the yield curve. I am trying to imagine the scenario of why they would want to target a very specific part of the yield curve. I would imagine—and I have to be careful because I am not trying to give the Bank advice here on monetary policy, but this is purely as an observer—that the Bank would be looking, when it comes to any programmatic sales to be doing something quite similar to what they did on the way in. In other words, they would look across the entire yield curve and probably not want necessarily to target any one particular part.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That is a personal opinion.

Robert has the responsibility of ensuring an orderly gilt market. Although we do not have that responsibility officially the Government’s debt market is part of the transmission mechanism for interest rates, and it is not in our interests, either from a financial or monetary stability point of view, to have a disorderly Government debt market. So, our interests are very much aligned.

We have injected something like £280 billion extra reserves into the system. There were £36 billion of reserves at the start of doing QE, so there is an awful lot of cash we need to unwind. I suspect, going forward, the banks will be required to hold much bigger reserves portfolios than they did before as part of their reserve buffers. So, there will be a certain amount of cash we will absolutely have to take out of the market, and we will then have to back those reserves with something. That could be gilts or it could just be our lending operations. We haven’t decided that yet.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">So, I could imagine a situation in which a certain proportion of gilts remained on our balance sheet to back a high level of reserves, and we could do that as part of the unwind, but that is very speculative at the moment. The starting point would be that we should expect to unwind the monetary impulse that we have put in, and that will certainly involve selling off at least a substantial proportion of the gilts, probably most of them.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q384 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr McFadden:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I won’t detain you long; I think we have reached the end of this. I want to take you back to where we started. Mr Fisher, I am a bit confused about the replies you gave earlier about your response to the Ben Bernanke tapering signal. If I remember rightly, when we started this session you were saying something along the lines of injecting that kind of uncertainty into the market is not a bad thing. Yet after the recent meeting, the MPC appeared to not like that reaction by saying that expectations of interest rates going up any time in the near future were not warranted. Can I ask you, within the Bank was the reaction to Ben Bernanke’s tapering announcement that it was welcome news or that it was not warranted? It can’t be both of these things.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Fisher</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: What I was saying about the US is very much a personal view rather than a Bank view, but the US economy is much further advanced than we are in terms of the rate of growth and its general levels of activity. So, what is right for the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is not necessarily right for the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, and that is what we were saying in the MPC statement. We did not think there had been enough changes in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> data or the outlook to warrant the change in gilt rates that we had seen as a result of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> announcement. That does not mean to say that what happened in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> wasn’t appropriate, given where </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> policy is.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q385 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr McFadden:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Since we have had a dry run—if you want to call it that, a little bit—through this Ben Bernanke experience, what other discussions in the Bank on how to communicate the beginning of the exit to QE, how confident are you that you can signal the exit without shouting “Fire!” in the theatre?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Fisher</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It will be a great challenge. I should say that all of the discussions we are having at the moment are more about whether we should be giving forward guidance and using thresholds; whether we should be giving more stimulus rather than discussing what the exit strategy will be. We will no doubt get to that when we get a bit closer to the exit. I think people have looked very hard at what has happened in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and will be absorbing that, in terms of what our reactions in future might be. One of the messages I personally take is that it is dangerous if you let the market get so one way round in their expectations that things have become a one-way bet in the market. That is essentially what had happened.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">By being transparent, you should be in a position where there are risks on both sides all the time.

We can’t control the degree of volatility in the markets. As I said at the start, the markets will be forward-looking. They will get a little bit of news and they will move quite a long way. That </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">will happen as we get up towards the exit point.

I completely agree, and I think that is true. I would just say that the nature of the independence that we have is, for instance, a different one to the nature of the Bank’s independence, which is statutory. As I said at the beginning, we do not have any legal existence of our own. So, arguably, I would say that independence is not quite as hard, for instance, as it is in the case of the Bank of England. That does not mean that we would not defend it robustly if, for any reason, we felt that it was unnecessarily being threatened.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q397 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> If you were official, your port of call to protect yourself would be first of all to a senior official and then to a Minister, if you could get any change, and then finally if you wanted you could take it to the Cabinet Secretary to force a discussion with the Prime Minister.

I can’t think of one occasion, in the 15 years that the DMO have existed, where we have felt the need to engage in a public discussion to emphasise our independence in the face of something that might undermine that.

When that goes into reverse, your job might get quite tough. I am sure it is not easy now—I am very pleased you sleep at night. But there may be quite wide implications for the economy as a whole, and I want to be clear on what you are going to do about it if you feel you are being unreasonably leaned on, for any purpose whatever that may be.
