During our conversation afterwards, you suggested I might write to share my experience of looking for work and becoming an apprentice. I hope this letter is helpful to you. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">After my GCSEs, I spent a few months at a sixth form college before deciding that an academic setting was not right for me. While my friends wanted to go to university, I was keen to start work as soon as possible. I applied constantly for posts online (6-7 per day), cold-called companies, knocked on doors and went to see Job Centre Plus many times. Even though I had 16 GCSEs and had previously had a Saturday job, I did not hear back from the jobs I applied for or was told that I had not got enough experience. I ended up signing on for nine months and felt like giving up. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The Work Programme mentioned the Barclays apprenticeship scheme. I never thought I would work in a bank and didn’t think my background would be appropriate for it. I was worried that I wouldn’t fit in but decided to try. Elmfield recruitment gave me lots of training about how to apply (e.g. practice interviews) and how to act in the workplace. They then arranged for me to meet the Branch Manager. I was nervous beforehand, but felt prepared for my interview. I was offered a post as an apprentice the same day - 25 September 2012. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">I was worried about my first day but the Branch Manager invited me in beforehand to meet everyone. All of my colleagues were very friendly and focussed on training me to serve customers. I spent a year as an ‘Operational Specialist’ which means working behind the counter, helping with customer queries, and balancing my till at the end of the day. The best moment was preventing a fraud from taking place. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">After just over a year in the role, I have just been promoted. I have extra responsibility for health and safety, handling higher value payments, and balancing ATMs. I have started to take qualifications in financial services, and would like to work towards a degree in Corporate and Investment Banking so that I can have a long career at Barclays. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Many of my friends have been unable to get jobs, and others have student loan debt with jobs paying the minimum wage. I feel very lucky to have become an apprentice and found a permanent job that I enjoy. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">28 January 2014 </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
