Politicians are currently no more popular in Wales than in other parts of the United Kingdom.  There is always a risk that a referendum will be treated as a general plebiscite on the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">performance of the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">government rather than a vote on the issue at hand.  Moreover any measure which can be represented as increasing the prospect of tax rises will inevitably incur some opposition.  A referendum is therefore far from certain to succeed, with risks to the political career of those promoting it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">If the costs are evident, the benefits are not. The principal, and correct, argument for </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">significant </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">devolution </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">of taxation </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">is accountability.  Th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">at</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> is of clear benefit to the electorate but its attraction to the politicians is less obvious. Who would be accountable if he or she could avoid it? The measure has to have other attractions to appeal to the political class. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Yet t</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">he form of income tax devolution set out in the Bill is most unlikely ever to be used.  It would be going too far to say it is entirely unusable but the Commission I chaired analysed the case carefully before concluding that the single rate form of tax devolution was unsuitable for Wales.  The Silk commission concurred.  The Welsh border is too open for it to be safe to raise higher tax rates; revenue would be more likely to fall over time than rise.  A cut in all tax rates would, however, be prohibitively expensive in the short to medium term, particularly so in current conditions of budget reductions.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';

font-size:12pt"> that it replaces</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">.  That is a risk that I believe it is fair to ask the Welsh government to run.  It is a necessary concomitant of accountability.  However it is combined with another risk, that when public expenditure begins to grow again in nominal terms the Welsh block grant will grow more slowly than public expenditure in England owing to the operation of  the unreformed Barnett formula.  The British government has given assurances that it will consider th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">at</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> issue when it arises but has given no categorical promise that it will do anything substantive about it and the Bill is mute on the block grant and its interaction with tax devolution.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

It would also make a referendum easier to win since the package would include stabilisation of the block grant and an end to the Barnett squeeze.  It would not be a </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">mere </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">sop to recalcitrant public opinion, however, because it would also have the advantage of being fair.

One can argue indefinitely over needs measures and the point estimate is less significant than the trend.  If Wales gets </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">a Barnett floor, in my opinion, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">that would enormously strengthen the attractions of the referendum.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Of course, the foregoing argument assumes the Bill is serious and the government actua</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">lly wants the</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> referendum to occur.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">  If the Bill is </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">just </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">a piece of political theatre or legerdemain</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> to give the impression of meeting Welsh aspirations or concerns but not embodying the intention of doing anything substantial, it may already be adequate for its purpose.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">6 January 2014</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
