font-size:12pt"> Good afternoon and welcome to you, Mr Sells.  Just a little bit of housekeeping if I may: we are expecting a vote in literally a few minutes’ time.  I will temporarily suspend and then we will come back as quickly as we can, but we are very grateful to you for joining us today for a pre</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">appointment hearing.  Just looking at your CV and the number of positions that you have held, it was interesting to see what made you particularly apply for this position in what was obviously a very strong field of candidates.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Andrew Sells</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I applied for this position because I strongly believe—and I have always been a country boy—that I could make a useful contribution to it.  If I could just put that in context, when I got to the age of about 50 or 55, I decided that I wanted to devote at least half my life to putting back and being a useful public servant, if I could.  I am passionate about the countryside.  I live in the countryside; I was born in the countryside.  I only ever came to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> to earn a living.  I feel that I can understand and empathise with those people who want to improve our countryside, and that is why I applied for the job.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt;

font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It is quite different from the work that you have done before, which I could possibly describe as high finance.  What makes you feel that you are well qualified or suitable for the position of Chairman of Natural England?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">time at the Department for Work and Pensions that was very different from anything else that I had done before.  I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed working in a topic I knew nothing about at that stage—very detailed, very technical, not a party</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">political issue at all.  I felt I was making a useful contribution, and I think the people concerned there had been good enough to say so.  I feel passionately about preserving our countryside, so I felt I could make a contribution here too.  Just going forward a little bit, part of the contribution clearly is hard work, sharing, being </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">driven by the statute, understanding science and technology, working hard and being able to work with people, and I felt I could do that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Andrew Sells</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I most relate to farming and the countryside.  I realise that I am a chartered accountant and I have spent years in investment and what-have-you but, actually, I used to work as a boy on a farm in East Anglia.  A lot of what I was doing was working on a tractor, increasing every size of every field wherever you could, without any concern for the wildlife, biodiversity and whatever.  Actually, I think we have come a long, long way in those years but, in that time, we have lost two thirds of our bird population in a lot of rural England.  I think I understand rural life.  I live in the country; I breathe in the country.  If I admit to a blank in my knowledge, it is much more likely to be around the marine area, where I have been briefed a little bit, but I know very little about it and I would like to learn more.  I think I understand the countryside.  I do not farm commercially but I roughly understand how the grants and incentives work, and can work around that.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt;

font-size:12pt">you declared that, were you conscious that there might be some political criticism from sections of the media that somebody with such a profile and association with the Conservative party was being nominated for the position that you sought?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Andrew Sells</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes, I was.  There are a few things I would like to say about my donations, if I might.  The first is that by far the largest donation I gave, and you will find it on the Electoral Commission website, is a single donation of £75,000.  In fact, it says “gift in kind” by that.  I actually gave the Conservative party a picture that cost me less than £15,000.  It was a portrait of David Cameron.  It had a bit of publicity at the time, because I was asked to fund the artist while he did it.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I would like also to say in my own defence—I have never said this before publicly and I did not think I would ever need to—but I have just done my tax return for 2012</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">13 and my donations to registered charities were a multiple of the sum of money, £15,000, that I have just quoted as a political donation.  I invite you to see it in that context.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I would also say that I will not give any more money to any political party, and that I have found, despite some press reports suggesting that I might have got this job because of donations, funnily enough, it feels quite the opposite from my perspective; it feels that I have got it despite them.  I am going to go back to the position which you referred to in respect of the no</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Neil Parish:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Good afternoon, Mr Sells.  You have talked a little bit about your previous experience and the fact that it did not particularly lead into the natural environment, so I just want to press you just a little bit on your role to conserve and enhance the natural environment.  You said a bit to the Chairman earlier, but where would you like to take Natural England?  What is your vision for the future, so to speak?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Andrew Sells</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Thank you, Mr Parish.  That is quite a big question.  If I could start, I think that Natural England has been through a period of considerable uncertainty.  I think its future was uncertain.  We have had the triennial review.  There was talk of Natural England losing its independent status.  The first thing I need to do is to make it clear to all the people who work for Natural England that we have an independent future.  We have a set of statutory duties and we intend to fulfil them.  We intend to carry on as an independent body doing that.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In an era of budget cuts, if possible we have to do more with less.  I am concerned that, for example, some of the biodiversity schemes are at risk if less money is made available for them.  That is an ongoing concern.  I am fairly briefed on what the issues that we are going to face are, so I certainly know the questions, even if I do not know the answers.  There are some things that need to be done within Natural England’s structure down the line and to implement the triennial review.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It is worth stating that, although Natural England has had a slightly uncertain future for a little bit, and has had some less than favourable press in certain quarters, people down the line are very passionate, very hardworking and need to be supported.  Actually, they are doing a very good job.  We need, at the top, to get the message out about what is actually going on.  We have the opportunity to restructure the board in the next year, with seven out of the eight directors coming up for renewal.  We have the opportunity to put in place a stronger area management team and a management team above that as well.  There will be quite a considerable effort and I see it as very hard work, for the next 18 months, to put in place and send those messages out.  Arising from that, we will fulfil our functions.  We will be really keen on biodiversity.  We will fulfil our marine functions, and I can go through the list of other responsibilities if you want, but I think you probably know them better than I do.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt;

font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jim Fitzpatrick:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> On the point that Mr Sells made about the eight directors and some coming up for renewal, in any organisation, there will be some people who will be renewed and some who will move on.  Are there any gaps among the directors that you spot, Mr Sells, which you would like to reinforce in terms of Natural England’s remit?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Andrew Sells</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I am quite reluctant to get into individual gaps for the very obvious reason that it suggests who might stay and who might not.  What I have always believed, in any management team, is you identify the strengths and weaknesses you have and then you look </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">to put pit props around where you do not have what you need.  We will be going through that exercise, working out, for example, whether we need individual expertise in certain areas or whether we buy it in, as and when we need it.  These are serious questions we will be looking at but, with great respect, I am not yet ready to answer.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt;

font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Neil Parish:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> My next question probably has a little bit of a sting in its tail.  You formerly, as you say, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">chaired</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> a house</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">building company, so what lessons did you learn from that about the balance between environmental improvements and rural growth?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Andrew Sells</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Quite a lot is the short answer.  Let me just say a few things.  Firstly, this company was an absolute specialist in developing brownfield sites, so we were the pioneer in developing exclusively brownfield sites, although in parenthesis I must say one or two greenfield</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">ish types were let through.  We transformed Caterham Barracks, where my father signed up in the war, into a modern urban village with a small Tesco, doctor’s surgery and whatever.  Actually, I was always the one fighting for conservation there and preservation of trees and what-have-you.  I think I learned that you can do huge amounts of development and enhance the landscape and the environment.  I also understand how impatient developers are to get on with it.  You can see the impatience from the other end of the telescope in the offices of Natural England struggling to deal with the requests they have to deal with.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I do not really want to get into a conversation—I do not think that is where you were leading me—into biodiversity offsetting, but one of the complaints of the developers, for example, is that it is very expensive.  Actually, quite a lot of compensation for the environment is not being enforced currently, so there is a case for looking at some of these things and holding the developers to greater account.  I do not want anybody to think that I am a friend of the developers.  I think I know exactly what they want and they will have to comply with the statutes that we operate under.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q22 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Neil Parish:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You talk about biodiversity offsetting.  In many ways, it is a good idea provided that the biodiversity offsetting is practical and actually delivers something for the environment.  I do not know whether you have any ideas on that.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Andrew Sells</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I have a number of ideas.  The first one is that, if offsetting becomes the norm, we will overlook the need to conserve what is actually there to be conserved.  The first stop must be to try not to damage what we otherwise might damage.  If ultimately it is decided to offset somewhere, it is then for discussion what type of offsetting we have.  It is out for consultation now.  It might be compulsory; it might be voluntary.  I ask the rhetorical question: how do you offset some ancient woodlands that HS2 is going to remove?  It cannot be done.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify;

font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Neil Parish:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Can I have just one final question, Madam Chair?  In the national parks, there is always a balance between making sure you maintain the national parks, but also where a little village or a hamlet may need a few houses, affordable homes or whatever.  It is always an interesting one to make sure that we can actually have that as well.  Have you ever given that any thought?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Actually, I do not think Natural England needs to go through quite the unprecedented level of change that is almost implied in the question.  It is doing very well on the ground.  It certainly has to make some changes.  It has to work closer with the Environment Agency but, actually, as I have looked at this job, it is working quite closely and very effectively with the Environment Agency on a whole host of things.  It understands down the line what it has to do.  I do not think it is a problem we are facing is what I am saying.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt;

font-size:12pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is very helpful to the farming community.  The Scottish equivalent is called Scottish Natural Heritage; their staff are allowed to give advice as well and inspect and cost</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;
