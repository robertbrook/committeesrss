For example, in Nottingham the councils have decided to extend the tram network by building two more lines. These lines go through some of the busiest cyc</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">ling paths and routes, making them essentially </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">unusable</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">. No alternative is being </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">offered or even considered.  Each urban redevelopment should enhance cycling, rather than degrade it, and this should be a legal requirement (Note I’m not against the tram or </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">even the route, just that no account was taken of the destruction of cycling routes nor was any replacement offered.) Concomitant with this should be a means of assessing how good any cycling provision is – some cycling lanes around here are awful and actu</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">ally make cycling harder and more dangerous. This assessment should ideally be done before any development and not be done by the council.</span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Car drivers, in general, are ignorant about cyclists. They often go on about Road Tax, even though it was abolished o</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">ver 70 years ago. They complain about cyclists not using cycling lanes (not a ;legal requirement) or cycling three feet out from the kerb (which is the recommended cycling position as Transport for London and (government approved) Bikeability have pointed </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">out.) These should be corrected. Ideally, every car driver should have to pass a Bikeability test before passing a driving test. At the very least, they should have to go on a course.</span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Strict Liability means that if there is no other evidence to the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">contrar</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">y</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> then the larger vehicle is at fault. So a HGV hitting a car would be at fault unless it was shown that the car pulled out without looking or ran a red light or otherwise was at fault. Likewise with cars and bikes or bikes and pedestrians. This would mean</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> that the concept of larger vehicles having a duty of care to smaller ones would become enshrined in British Law and hopefully would affect driving practice.</span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Traffic regulations are not enforced.

If this results in an a</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">ccident, it should always lead to a prosecution and some sort of penalty. It should not be seen as just one of those things. All accidents are caused by someone’s carelessness.

The maximum gaol sentences for such crimes </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">are appropriate, (5 and 14 years) but should be used more often – perhaps there </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">should be a minimum?</span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 32pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The penalties for careless driving seem appropriate (£2,500 max fine and 3 to 9 points – though 6 to 9 might be better), but they should be used more often.
