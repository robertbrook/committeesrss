Effective Parliamentary scrutiny is an essential component of good government, but too often constructive proposals are allowed to wither on the vine because of the unresponsiveness of Governments.  It is encouraging that the Liaison Committee wants to see that its proposals are followed through.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="3" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">We are not in a position to monitor all Select Committees, but our impression is that they have become more effective in carrying out their scrutiny role in recent years. We think there is still scope, however, for each Select Committee to look more closely at the inputs, outputs and value for money achieved across the whole of a relevant Department as well as at specific policy and delivery matters. For this purpose they should be able to call Permanent Secretaries to give evidence.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="4" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Since the Liaison Committee reported on Select Committee Effectiveness our main focus has been on the work of the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee (PCRC) on standards for legislation. We see this as a top priority issue for both the Executive and Parliament given the poor quality of some Bills presented to Parliament in recent years under successive Governments. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The Lobbying Bill is just the latest example of Bills drawn up hastily, without proper consultation and not properly thought through before they reach Parliament.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="5" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">We therefore strongly support the PCRC Report on Legislative Standards - in particular its recommendations for a Code of Legislative Standards, agreed between Government and Parliament, and a House Legislative Standards Committee to monitor their application – and were very disappointed when the Government summarily rejected both proposals: </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">“It is the responsibility of government to bring forward legislation of a high standard” (Andrew Lansley). </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="6" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The Government argued that improvements to Explanatory Notes would be sufficient to achieve improved standards of legislation, that a Code was not required, and that therefore a Legislative Standards</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Committee was not necessary. We reject these arguments. While improvements to Explanatory Notes would be welcome they are not a substitute for a clear and agreed statement of standards for all legislation. And Parliament, not just the Government, has an obvious interest in monitoring standards of legislation. The work of the House of Lords </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee demonstrates that such matters can be dealt with successfully on a non-partisan basis</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="7" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">We hope that the Liaison Committee and the PCRC will continue to press the Government hard both on agreeing a Code of Legislative Standards on the lines recommended by the PCRC and on the establishment of a Legislative Standards Committee. We see this as vital both for good government and for Parliament’s constitutional duty to hold the Executive to account. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">14 </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">November 2013</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt; text-align:justify"><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
