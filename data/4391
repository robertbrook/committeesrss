font-size:12pt"> Welcome to all the Ministers to this second evidence session on the performance of the Department for Communities and Local Government.  We met the officials about a month ago, and we welcome the Ministers this afternoon.  It is our understanding that the Secretary of State is indisposed this afternoon and not able to be with us.  I have known the Secretary of State for many years.  We have had frequent political discussions.  We have not always agreed with each other, but I certainly know this about the Secretary of State: he would never miss an opportunity to come and put forward his views if he was at all able.  I am sure we all wish him well for a speedy recovery.  It has been indicated that he will come to the Committee at a later date to be agreed when we will do the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">“</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Ask Pickles</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">”</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> session.  We would not ask Ministers to do that in his stead this afternoon.  Welcome to Baroness Stowell, who has come to help us with any questions we may have about the overall running of the Department.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">At the beginning, perhaps I could welcome Kris Hopkins and Stephen Williams.  I think it is their first time before the Committee.  Other Ministers have been here before and have survived, so that is a fairly good recommendation.  I would also like to put on record my thanks and those of the Committee to Ministers who are not with us.  Mark Prisk was always extremely helpful, extremely well briefed and courteous in all his dealings with the Committee, and I want to put on record our thanks to him.  Baroness Hanham, who was in place from the beginning of this Parliament, made many visits.  On the last occasion, when we did an inquiry into public health, she was robust in her defence of a policy, which the Committee certainly welcomed, and was extremely open and disarming about the challenges to be faced by local authorities and government in implementing it.  We thank her as well for her work.  Don Foster is in a slightly </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">different category.  I do not know whether we can describe his appointment to the office of Chief Whip as a move to higher things, but we certainly thank him as well, particularly for his work on the electrical industry, which we are going to be continuing, and we look forward to hearing from Stephen Williams on that particular issue in due course.  Thank you all for coming this afternoon.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I suppose the obvious question to begin with is: when the Secretary of State is away, who is in charge?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Brandon Lewis</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I know the Secretary of State would want me to thank you for your very kind opening remarks.  If he could possibly have been here, he would have been.  He is very much looking forward to dealing with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">“</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Ask Pickles</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">”</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.  I do not think any of us at this table would venture to put words into his mouth and try to answer them ourselves, so he will be looking forward to that opportunity.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q145 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So who is in charge?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Brandon Lewis</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Baroness Stowell will deal with some of the corporate issues, but I will be able to answer, hopefully, any questions that you would have liked to put to the Secretary of State.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q146 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The question I begin with might be one Kris Hopkins can help us with.  On 15 July the Committee had before it Julian Ashby, the social housing regulator.  Very unusually, the Committee immediately wrote to the Secretary of State and said, “We have not done our report yet, but you ought to have a look at the evidence session because we have such great concerns about it”, which were then reflected in our report.  We have had a reply from the regulator himself.  Although we wrote to the Secretary of State and he said he would look at it and get back to us, we have not yet had a reply.  One may be in the pipeline somewhere, but is it possible to tell us when we are likely to receive the reply?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Kris Hopkins</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I believe a response has been sent to you.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q147 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> In that case, you will probably be able to answer the next question.  Minister, do you and the Department now have full confidence in Mr Ashby?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Kris Hopkins</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes, absolutely.  Your letter and the opportunity for the Secretary of State to respond to it has given us the opportunity to have a conversation with Mr Ashby and his team, and we are absolutely confident that he can undertake the challenge that he has.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q148 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you think that financial viability is sufficiently distinct as something which the regulator monitors and comments on publicly and is a proper use of categories and is not now simply seen as something that can hide behind concerns about governance; in other words, that governance ratings will be used as a surrogate for financial ratings?  Have we got that problem well and truly sorted out?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Kris Hopkins</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes.  The Secretary of State has had that conversation with Mr Ashby and he is content about that.  Rather than looking to use one of the three indicators out there, the work of the regulator is to regulate and monitor what is going on and intervene, where there is a need to take action, before there are any dramas.  That is the important part of it</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: that we are </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">confident that they are monitoring what is going on in that fi</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">eld, and holding them to account.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> On consumer issues, it seemed to us the regulator was almost saying to us that he had hardly any meaningful role any more.  One complaint has been upheld all year.  It did not seem like any regulation that was meaningful and was an awful lot of effort for very little return.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Kris Hopkins</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: To build on what I have just said about that constant engagement, just because there has been one response does not mean there has been one engagement with one authority or one organisation.  The dialogue that has gone on </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">between </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">the Secretary of State and Mr</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Ashby is about reinforcing that, making sure they have the full range of powers open to them and they use that power at their discretion.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q151 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> If we found that after another year nothing much more had happened on the consumer side in terms of any negative findings by the regulator of things going wrong, would the Government have another look at whether the whole issue of consumer regulation was really fit for purpose?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Kris Hopkins</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: If there had been clear failures in associations or organisations out there which had not been identified, you could say that the regulator had been unsuccessful because it had not put its finger on that particular one, but I reiterate that the fact </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">the regulator may not find a problem with an organisation does not mean it is not working with them, understanding what challenges they have got, intervening and holding them to account.  We will look in 12 months’ time.  I hear what you have said about what could happen, but I am not going to say at this moment that we are going to instigate an inquiry into something that may or may not happen.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Maybe we will have another look at it in 12 months’ time and come back to you.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">James Morris:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I want to ask about the Homes and Communities Agency, which is probably in your remit again, Kris.  When Grant Shapps was the Minister he said that the chief executive, Andy Rose, should be paid less than the Prime Minister.  Would you agree with that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Kris Hopkins</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I do not disagree with that.  Some of the salaries that public individuals have are disproportionate.  I will not disagree with what Grant said.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q153 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">James Morris:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The Homes and Communities Agency is paying Andy Rose annually an £18,000 London location allowance on top of his £142,000 basic salary.  Why is that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Kris Hopkins</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is for the Homes and Communities Agency to answer for why they are doing that.  At the end of the day, we need to make sure that they are delivering the work required of them, but it is a valid question and we can ask them.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">James Morris:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Is there anything particular about his role which means there is justification for an allowance on top of what is quite a substantial salary?  I know that salaries are very much in the news today, but is there a justification for that?  Is not £142,000 enough to tide you over in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Kris Hopkins</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think it is a bit mean to ask me at this moment in time about his accommodation.  The issue of salaries is very current, and the question of expenses associated with that follows many routes.  I am not quite sure </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">whether it </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">is helpful for MPs to challenge and publicly respond to that at this moment in time.  The finger could quickly be pointed back at us.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">James Morris:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The main reason I am concentrating on it is to do with transparency.  I think there was a commitment to publish senior salaries on the Homes and Communities Agency website.  I do not think that has been updated for a while.  Following the session on 14 October, the Chair wrote to Mr Rose to ask whether the HCA had conducted and published the results of its staff survey.  In reply, Mr Rose confirmed that the HCA did conduct a staff survey and enclosed a copy of the results, but he said those results were published internally for staff and do not appear on the HCA website.  With the really good focus on transparency, why does the HCA not publish this kind of information and put it in the public domain?  Is there any particular reason for that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Kris Hopkins</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: On publishing salaries, if they have said that and made a commitment I will challenge them as to why that has not happened.  On the issue of an internal survey, if you want members of staff to be honest and frank in their responses, I am not quite sure how that was conducted, whether there were names against them or whether they wanted to protect individuals.  It is right that they are transparent about that process, but, if there are actions coming out of that which might be embarrassing to an individual employee, would we want to compromise that? That is not to say they could not put it into a format that protected the individual.  I am quite happy to ask the chief executive about that staff survey.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify;

font-size:12pt"> to take years, sometimes stretching into a decade.  Therefore, the review of the national infrastructure regime that we have announced is based on the idea that nobody is asking for it to be torn up and started all over again, but that there are other areas where people think that some improvement and clarification could be brought in, and that relates particularly to pre-application consultation and when you have consulted enough to be able safely to submit your planning application.  That is with regards to national infrastructure.  Is that what you were focusing on, or were you talking more about the major infrastructure categories?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

and that, given the urgency and particularly the linkages between growth and planning decisions, it was appropriate to have a specialist court with specialist judges and in a sense its own queue, which would, by definition, be shorter.  The hope is that that will speed up decision</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

I am not sure I can remember whether Crossrail went through that procedure.  It is something to do with the combination of public and private interests, but, Mr Chairman, I am sure you are more knowledgeable about this than I am.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I am learning from you all the time on these things.  We move on to other planning issues.  The national planning practice guidance suggests that signals, such as house prices, should be taken into account when assessing housing need.  Is it a change of emphasis or a change of policy?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Nick Boles</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is very much a change in emphasis.  It has always been the case that, in assessing need, local authorities have been encouraged to take evidence from any possible source.  Of course, the Office for National Statistics population projects are a critical component, but it has never been suggested that that is the only way in which you might want to form a view about how to project your need over a period of time.  That art of projection is itself a rather complex one, to which many factors could contribute.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">All we have wanted to do—as you are very well aware, this is only draft guidance at the moment, and we have not yet finalised it—is respond to reports commissioned by the last Labour Government and others, which have suggested that one indicator, which is an important one, is to look at is the relationship locally between house prices and wages.  Even if you think that you are supplying enough housing against ONS projections, if house price rises over a period of time are out of proportion to increases in local wages, that is probably telling you that demand and supply are not managing to settle at the right level, and should at least raise the question as to whether you should be planning to build more houses.  There is no suggestion that this is an absolute factor or the absolute determinant; it is simply a case of saying that you have to be able to explain why your plans are consistent with the desire on the part of Government, which Mr Hopkins’ predecessor, Grant Shapps, made explicit, not to have real house price inflation as a constant theme, as it has been for the last 30 years.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Let us move on to something we have discussed before, both in a meeting and across the Chamber: taking price into account both ways.  Where prices are a bit depressed it might also reflect a fall-off in demand.  When you look at paragraph 47 of the NPPF and the test that sites included in the five-year supply have to be deliverable and therefore viable, very often developers say that brownfield sites are now not viable and they cannot make them stack up, but that is also a reflection of falling house prices in those areas.  That is probably a reflection of demand being lower than it was a few years ago.  We have developers saying, “Throw out the brownfield sites; we want more </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">greenfield</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> sites,” when demand has fallen off as well, so you do not need as many sites in total maybe over five years.  How do you marry together those various conflicts?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Nick Boles</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: In a sense, it can be done only locally because the combination of factors is likely to be different in each locality.  You are certainly right to suggest that, if there has been a trend of falling house prices in an area, that implies that demand is weaker than supply by definition.  Therefore, in a sense it would work in the opposite direction against your population projections.  If your population projections suggest that you need to build thousands and thousands of houses, but you have had consistent house-price deflation, you could equally use that as an argument </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">for </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">why you should plan differently.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The viability of sites is a slightly different point, though I see the linkage.  That relates to the value at which the land was acquired for development and the cost of getting it to a point where it can be developed, which is the relevant point for some brownfield.  Much brownfield does not cost a lot to get ready for development, but some does.  In the context of falling house prices, the question then is whether you can make any money building a house.  Ultimately, we do not have a nationalised house-building industry; we rely on the private sector to find the money and invest it, and they will do it only if they are going to make a decent return on their capital.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">One of the reasons for the new permitted development rights, about which I know you have some concern, is that we want to make the most use of the property that is already developed so </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

it is as fundamental as having a plan for local social services or the like; it is an absolutely core responsibility.  I am not going to suggest that somehow lots of people will merrily go off to do local plans, but are not doing it now, just because we pass a law saying it is a requirement, but it sends a strange signal that it is not a statutory duty for a local authority to produce a local plan.  I have never heard a good argument as to why a local authority does not need to do a local plan.  Therefore, it seems to me reasonable to consult on making it a statutory duty, which is our proposal.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It is about two years to the day since the Portas review.  It made 28 recommendations, and I think we have acted on 27.  We have 27 Portas pilots.  We also have 333 town teams; we have town centre partnerships and business improvement districts all looking at what is right for them.  One of the strengths is the variety of options out there.  I described it a little while ago.  Instead of saying, “This is the model you must follow”, there is a menu.  An area can look at that menu and choose what is right for it to try to develop its area.  Part of the strength of the Portas pilots and the town teams is that a variety of different things is going on.  People are looking at what is right for their areas.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

it can be the heartbeat of a community.  Those out-of-town centres are selling products that tend to be very easily obtained online.  As online shopping grows, that is where the bigger issue might be down the line.  Town centres can benefit by offering something different.  Perhaps Nick wants to touch on the planning side.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Nick Boles</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There is a suggestion that somehow this is a new thing.  It has never been the case that it is impossible to gain planning permission for out-of-town-centre retail development in all circumstances.  What has been clear, and is still clear, is that you have to go through the so-called sequential test to establish whether a proposed development not in a town centre is acceptable and reasonable.  I am not aware of a great number of cases where that seems to have been interpreted by the decision-maker, to use planning jargon, in a way that is different from what we would expect.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">Margate</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.  If you look at it, the argumentation in the decision letter was very clear.  It was a matter of whether that development would bring in more to the town centre, albeit perhaps not right in the centre centre, than it would undermine it, and the general feeling, backed by the MP, was that it was positive.  The test is a rigorous one.  It may sometimes give a green light to something that is not a town-centre development, but it is only after fulfilling all that rigorous test.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt">Beacon</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Park</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.  The view is that it is very beneficial, because when that opens up it will provide road access into Gorleston from part of the Great Yarmouth constituency, even south </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Norfolk</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, that at the moment simply would not take place because of the way the access works.  Therefore, it could be quite beneficial in increasing footfall.  Equally, when </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Lakeside</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, a great out-of-town shopping area, opened, arguably it had an impact on some of the surrounding towns.  I was the leader of Brentwood Council; that town had empty shops and a lot of charity shops.  In the four or five years I was there we managed to turn it round.  </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Brentwood</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">Dartford</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> about how to grow and develop.  It can be quite beneficial.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt"> You have explained that town centres can remain vibrant, but would you agree that they really need to shrink? Too many local authorities are attempting to defend a town centre based on boundaries of 20 or 30 years ago, often with pepper-potted vacancies.  It would make more sense for them to retrench and say, “What we have got is full, occupied and vibrant”, rather than finding other things.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Brandon Lewis</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: You make a very good point.  I have spoken about this a few times recently.  We have just finished a consultation about being able to convert retailing to residential with reference to the vibrancy and vitality of the town centre.  That reflects exactly your point.  Whether it is a kind of ribbon town with a high street or a classic square town centre, over a long period we have had what some people describe as octopus legs that go off.  You have exactly the problem you talked about.  Being able to refocus that and bring it back to the town centre has two beneficial impacts.  One is that it is a chance to create the homes we need, but putting people on top of the town centre also increases the footfall in the town centre and hopefully brings those shops back in to fill any gaps that are there.  Therefore, it works on several different levels.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Nick Boles</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We are very keen to encourage this, hence the permitted development right with the prior approval regime.  To be very clear, it is much better if this is done in a planned way.  We hope that the permitted development right will encourage local authorities to be much clearer about the core on which they are trying to focus and where, probably, they will refuse prior approval for conversions to residential on the basis of vitality and vibrancy, and, as to what is beyond the core, where they will take a relaxed view.  An authority being very clear upfront about where it thinks the heart of its future town centre lies is much the best way to go, and it can then underpin that permitted development right and make it work.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

Spencer, which we mourn deeply, particularly at this time of year.  That was a grievous blow to the town.  My message has been consistently that, if we want to hang on to our hospital, get Marks &amp; Spencer back and get the relief road built, we need to build more houses.  That is exactly what the excellent local authority is planning to do.  I think that will pull Marks &amp; Spencer back in, ideally to a rather better shop than it was in before.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Brandon Lewis</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Having those conversions puts people right on top of the town centre, but it also means being very focused on what the business community wants.  I will give you a parochial example, if you will bear with me.  In Great Yarmouth, the growth of the energy industry just down the road from the town centre has had the impact of bringing stores and brand names into that town centre in the last year or so that simply were not there before.  It is because they have been able to react to that change in market and develop that growth, along with housing growth, that there is footfall in the town centre in the first place, all of which does not detract from the fact that you still need car parking that is accessible, easy and cheap.  Stephen has the longest high street in the country and, therefore, has great expertise on this.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

I just do not think it is for Government to dictate that.  One size does not fit all.  I said to Bill that I thought he should find two or three areas that agree with him where he can pilot it and, like anybody else, share that best practice and say, “It works here, and we think this could work for you”.  From the limited amount that I know of Bill, he will probably take it up and charge ahead with it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt">Braintree</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.  I met a range of businesses of all different types, from large retailers through to very small independent market-style retailers.  I found a universal welcome to the changes that came in on Thursday.  Every business wants to have lower taxes.  I ran businesses.  I think you had the opening of your wife’s shop on Saturday.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt;

it is part of it, not the whole of it.  There is obviously a wide geography.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The advice of the VOA at the time the decision had to be made was that there would be about 800,000 losers from a revaluation and 300,000 winners.  Retail would have been one of the losers as a sector, so a decision had to be made.  An awful lot of the bodies have been arguing that we should have more frequent revaluations.  I have to say that, as good as those businesses are, they tend to be surveyors who make their money from doing revaluations, so there is a vested interest, but this was the only review on which the Government had to base it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> office space, the big winners from a revaluation would have been the banks and financial institutions with offices in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.  Retail across the country would have been one of the losers.  Pubs and places like that would have been huge losers, particularly independent places.  We had to make a decision based on the independent advice we were given, and that showed far more losers than gainers.  It seemed to be the right decision to make for the benefit of stability and business across the piece.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

we had a real-terms drop overall.  What I have said to local authorities generally is, bearing in mind there is the 1% offer from central Government if you freeze, what your officers are saying is that they want to put up council tax </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

I think anybody would struggle to say that they’re not coping very well.  There are still a lot of councils who could do a lot more in terms of efficiency, with shared management and shared administration.  The Community Budget programme, which you particularly turn to, is a really important step forward.  We have also now moved that on and we have another nine authorities as part of the transformation network.  We have put money into those, and particularly those that are developing that, breaking down the barrier across the public sector along with local government.  Stephen, did you want to—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">i</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">nquiries in the first four days, so there is a huge appetite to participate in this.  It is part of the offer as far as mortgages are concerned, which are complementing the existing schemes out there.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> about prices, it is very varied across the country.  Schemes like Help to Buy and the equity loan scheme, as far as new build coming out of the ground is concerned, are having a positive impact.  The Treasury and the Bank of England are keeping a clear eye on the consequences of these interventions, but I do believe they are extremely positive.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Nick Boles</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It was a very reasonable question to ask whether the supply side was going to respond to the stimulus that has been given to demand.  It is an area for constant vigilance and it is entirely right that the Bank of England and the Financial Policy Committee are constantly watching that.  That is what the Chancellor asked them to do right from the very start of introducing Help to Buy.  The good news that we have is that the number of housing plots giving planning consent has gone up by 35% year on year, which suggests that a couple of things are happening: firstly, that house-builders are applying for planning permission on more sites, and that local authorities are granting planning permission for more sites.  That is not to say that the level is yet at the level that would match up to the estimates that most people have for the housing need.  We still need to see housing supply respond more, and that, of course, is why we are constantly looking at ways to make the planning process work more efficiently.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

they were absolutely delighted.  It was something I do not think they had ever dreamed about actually doing.  A few days later the transaction had gone through, and I got a picture that is in my office now.  I am really proud that this Government has facilitated that.  In addition to that, as my colleague has said, we want to build more houses as a direct consequence of that intervention.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

the structure works well.  It is good that we practise what we preach.  We are going even further just as we are moving forward into next year because we will be decamping from Eland House and bunking in with our colleagues from the Home Office to show how you can not just share management, but also share assets and property as well to save another £9 million a year for the taxpayer.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;
