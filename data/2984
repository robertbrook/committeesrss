Brian Drysdale calculatedly manoeuvred his car onto the level crossing and positioned it within the closed barriers into a position where he would be hit by a fast moving train, in order to kill himself</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">Nothing could have prevented what occurred at the crossing and sadly there were other fatalities as well as Stan and as human nature shows, these circumstances sometimes bring out the worst in people.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">It is a simple concept of how trains run; they run on a track, with no steering ability for the driver, they are driven to a timetable, there will be no </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">‘traffic’ hold ups, they run as directed by the signalling system, which ensures there are no other trains in their path and therefore they run at the correct running speed for the line they are on. It is frightening that so called cleaver, well educated and professionals in their own right, cannot comprehend this simple concept.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">Myself and our children had to endure hostilities from the first ever contact with the other deceased passengers families, even from some of the Advocates at the Inquest into their deaths. They did not understand the simple concept on how a train runs, they only sought to blame the ‘railway’ for their loss, aided and abetted by their ‘professional’ Advocates, who either did not want to understand how railways operate</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt"> or didn’t care, because they were in the ‘spotlight’ and just appeared to want to score points.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">On any formal occasion, which necessitated the deceased families to come together, we were subjected to ridicule because we were seen as supporting the railway industry, who they so desperately wanted to blame. They had seemed to loose sight of the fact that the train was derailed as a direct result of Brian Drysdale</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">’</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">s selfish act of taking his own life, in the way he did. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">O</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">n one occasion </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">a relative of someone else who died in the crash  </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">telephoned my Family Liaison Officer and abused him and stated he was also working for the railway industry and made derogatory comments about me.

I still to this day find it hard to get over the fact that all concerned had lost someone dear to them and we should all be grieving their loss and not trying to blame an ‘industry’ as opposed to the person responsible.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">From the time of the accident and to the end of the inquest, the British Transport Police were always professional and always gave me facts as they emerged, as I had insisted on from the outset. It is sad to think that as a professional police force responsible for policing the railways, they are not widely recognised for the professionals they are.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">From the beginning of the inquest, I understood what the purpose of it was, that is to determine, who/where/when/how people died. I cannot say the same for the Advocates, who many a time appeared to be out of their comfort zone and saw the Coroners Court as a normal courtroom where it was their job to score points against their adversaries when in actual fact it was their job to listen and represent the families who had engaged them. Other Advocates saw the inquest as a public inquiry into the workings and corrections related to the rail industry and to the detriment of the families attending lost sight of the fact that those who they represented were still grieving for their loved ones.

This became abundantly clear as the inquest progressed and was also seized upon by other families Advocates and were it not for the strong leadership of Peter Bedford, the Coroner, the inquest could have become jus</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">t</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt"> a debate into the safety features the railway industry should adopt.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt"> Sadly for other families, their Advocates did not understand many of the railway experts therefore those experts were questioned about either matters which they did not have expertise in or they were asked to speculate as to a particular set of circumstances, all of which drew the proceedings out for the bereaved families</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">. The family </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">of the person who abused me </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">were also responsible for supplying information to the press during the inquest which resulted in the Coroner having to instruct an Advocate to contact </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">a </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">lawyer </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">and inform her that he did not expect to see any future articles about his conduct of the inquest.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">On a personal level, I was pleased with the outcome of the Inquest as it brought no criticism of Stan or the railway industry, which I strongly believe </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">disheartened other bereaved families who I suggest were looking for a monetary compensation pa</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">ck</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">age from the industry.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">Subsequent to the inquest I believe that the crossing at Ufton Nervet is to be replaced by a bridge. In the interest of safety and even more so for the trauma caused to train drivers and members of the British Transport Police who have to deal with any fatality on the railway system, all levels crossing, where practicable should be closed and if necessary be replaced by bridges. I shall never have any doubt in the railways industry nor their strive to keep the railways safe for all those who travel on trains.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic">October 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-indent:45pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:center"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:center"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
