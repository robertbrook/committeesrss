For example, simply taking someone out of work into employment whilst invaluable needs to be monitored for longer-term persistence in work as well. Was this outcome a result of simple job matching with no input in terms of additional skills or employability training, or was it a result of such training being provided?

I would strongly advise inviting Mike Thompson, who runs this programme for Barclays to give evidence.
