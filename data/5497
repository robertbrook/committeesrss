font-size:11pt">ds and the tangible disease risks they can present, makes them an unsuitable group of animals to be kept by the vast majority of people.  Professional zoological establishments and the few well informed private individuals, who often work in tandem with th</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">e reputable zoo community</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">, are the only groups that have the required skills and resources to manage these animals in an appropriate and humane manner.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The establishment of the Dangerous Wild Animal Act (DWA) did much to control the keeping of primates wit</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">hin the UK, with the exception of the Callitrichids (marmosets and, more recently, tamarins), and I would suggest that from a disease perspective specifically, it would be prudent to include all primates under this existing piece of legislation.  Of course</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> the DWA is a piece of health and safety legislation and often does little to promote good animal welfare.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Most wild animals make very poor pets and due to their biological and behavioural needs they are generally prone to being kept under less than ideal </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">or even adequate conditions by the general public.  Primates probably present the most complex order of animals that are a focus of the pet trade, and so it would be prudent and a significant advancement in national animal welfare legislation if a broad ba</span><span style="font-family:Calibri;
