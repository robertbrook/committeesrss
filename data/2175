We draw on our experience of using government data across our programme of work, and also specifically from researching our recent report </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Whitehall Monitor 2013</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">, which is our first attempt to provide an annual data-driven picture of the size, shape and performance of Whitehall. We analysed information published as open data under the Government’s transparency agenda, as well as other key data on the operations of government such as Budgets and departmental annual reports and accounts.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">In setting out its transparency agenda, the Government has put a challenge to external users to become ’armchair auditors’ and exposed itself to scrutiny. For this to be effective, users interested in understanding government and holding it to account need to be able to use data that is easy to access, interpret, and analyse. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">We believe that clarity, transparency and accessibility of key government data in general, and key financial data, such as budgets, in particular, are crucial to improving the effectiveness of government. Data that is easy to access and interpret externally can also enable better decision making inside government. When data is presented consistently and makes comparisons possible, for instance between departments, this can help decision makers in government.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">In answering the Committee’s questions, we argue that:</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The key issue with respect to data on government and its activities is not that more data should be published, but that it should be made easier to access, use and interpret.</span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Key data, such as budgets, spending reviews, and departmental accounts, should be made available in an open format, where this is currently not the case.</span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">To enable use and interpretation, data should be better documented and should, where possible, provide figures on a consistent basis.

We set these out below in response to the relevant questions about data quality and formats.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">We have set out our recommendations in full in our recent publication </span><a href="http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/whitehall-monitor-2013"><span style="color:#0000ff; font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; text-decoration:underline">Whitehall Monitor 2013</span></a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> (</span><a href="http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/IFG%20-%20Whitehall%20Monitor.pdf#page=78"><span style="color:#0000ff; font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; text-decoration:underline">Annex A</span></a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">), which is available at </span><a href="http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/our-work/whitehall-monitor"><span style="color:#0000ff; font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; text-decoration:underline">www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/our-work/whitehall-monitor</span></a></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Beyond these recommendations, we have also noticed that some information formerly published on departmental websites has been more difficult to locate following the transition to gov.uk. For instance, departmental </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">organograms</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> have become more difficult to find (and the interactive version can be difficult to use) and some data, to which data.gov.uk links, has not been migrated, making the data portal less useful. Even set piece announcement documents such as Budgets are on occasion difficult to find.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">We also believe that government effectiveness could be enhanced by making more data on contracted and commissioned public services available to the public. In particular, choice and competition would be enhanced if data on the performance of public service providers were published in a consistent fashion and made available to service users and external experts. It can also be argued that if more were known publicly about the economic performance of private sector service providers, the government would be better positioned effectively to fulfil its commissioner role in public service markets.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Question </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">6.

Several key data sources are not currently available in an accessible format. This includes budgets and autumn statements, spending review and spending round documents, Estimates, and many departmental annual reports and accounts. These are only available in PDF formats, making the data very difficult to reuse. Some estimates memoranda, which are key for interpreting this financial data, are not publicly available.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">In general, we suggest that the following improvements would make data much more usable for a wider range of users:</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Enable different users to access data in a form that is most useful for their needs</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">. Different users will want to use the data in different ways, and therefore different formats may work better to support their needs (e.g. PDF for those wanting simply to read or print the information, spreadsheet files for those wanting to analyse the data, APIs for those wanting to use the data in a more advanced fashion).</span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Key data should be provided in a machine-readable format</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> – CSV or Excel rather than PDF.
