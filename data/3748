The Committee asked for details about what these benefits might be. This paper seeks to articulate how and where these benefits will arise. The Civil Engineering Contractors Association believes that the following points cover the key benefits associated with pipeline visibility. </span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:120%; margin:0pt 0pt 11.35pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:10pt; font-weight:bold">Better resource allocation </span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:120%; margin:0pt 0pt 11.35pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:10pt">By developing an understanding of likely demand, suppliers can invest intelligently in plant and equipment, allocating often limited resources to those areas that will best position the supplier to respond to these demands. </span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:120%; margin:0pt 0pt 11.35pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:10pt; font-weight:bold">Improved skills /recruitment management </span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:120%; margin:0pt 0pt 11.35pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:10pt">With greater visibility suppliers would be able to invest in the skills that their workforce will need to meet future demand.

This reduces occurrence of the problems of ‘hot markets’ where in demand skills lead to poaching, while also cutting back on the need for large scale and costly redundancies when workload falls back. </span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:120%; margin:0pt 0pt 11.35pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:10pt; font-weight:bold">Ability to enter into long-term purchase agreements </span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:120%; margin:0pt 0pt 11.35pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:10pt">Current short-term visibility of investment programmes mean that both clients and suppliers may not have the confidence to enter into long-term purchase agreements for commodities and services, as it is impossible to predict future demand.

Part of the reason that such innovation currently does not take place is a lack of clarity over whether investment in research and development would pay dividends through sales of the resulting improved products and services. With greater pipeline transparency, suppliers could have more confidence to invest in such research based on the likely future market for the results of this innovation. </span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:120%; margin:0pt 0pt 11.35pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:120%; margin:0pt 0pt 11.35pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:10pt; font-weight:bold">Early identification of feast/famine situations (regional, sector, specialism/procurement or delivery) </span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:120%; margin:0pt 0pt 11.35pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:10pt">Prior to the recent downturn, there was considerable evidence that a major driver of escalating costs was the issue of workload shortages and surpluses. As noted above, shortfalls lead suppliers to lay off staff and shut operations, while work surpluses lead to spiralling costs due to resource shortages. Greater forward visibility of programme would help identify where there are likely to be excesses of demand or supply (whether this be in a region, a sector or specialism either at procurement stage or during delivery) allowing programming to be mod</span><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:10pt">ified to mitigate this effect. </span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:120%; margin:0pt 0pt 11.35pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:10pt; font-weight:bold">More effective response to procurement </span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:120%; margin:0pt 0pt 11.35pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:10pt">Poor procurement practices contribute to significantly reduced efficiency in construction. Often procurement takes place to a timetable that leaves the industry little time to respond. If suppliers had greater notice of when procurement would take place, they would respond by ensuring bid teams were in place and adequately resourced, producing more competent bids that will lead to more effective delivery on site. </span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:120%; margin:0pt 0pt 11.35pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:10pt; font-weight:bold">Create opportunities for collaborative procurement </span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:120%; margin:0pt 0pt 11.35pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:10pt">By creating visibility of the forward construction pipeline, clients can identify (either within their organisation or across the industry) opportunities for bundling of projects to drive greater efficiency. </span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:120%; margin:0pt 0pt 11.35pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:10pt; font-weight:bold">Ability for suppliers to make early business decisions </span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:120%; margin:0pt 0pt 11.35pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:10pt">An early understanding of the specification of a project provides a supplier with the opportunity to decide early on whether or not to put resources behind targeting a specific opportunity. Those suppliers that do so will be better placed to respond to the work when it comes to the market, while by taking the early decision suppliers who decide to avoid a project will save on the costs of tracking projects that turn out to be non-starters. </span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:120%; margin:0pt 0pt 11.35pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:10pt; font-weight:bold">Foster environment for greater early supply chain engagement </span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:120%; margin:0pt 0pt 11.35pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:10pt">Early certainty about a given project opens up the opportunity for a client to seek guidance on its development from the supply chain, either formally through an Early Contractor Involvement-style contractual approach, or through early market engagement (workshops/seminars).
