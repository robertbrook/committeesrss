The target of 155,000 falls far short of the need; that number are in recognised camps, but the numbers outside are nearer ten times that.

It also needs to assist these communities themselves to develop democratic processes in anticipation of their return.

My concern is that the smaller organisations such as Karenaid find it very difficult to have a voice. I will give you an example which I think illustrates a general point.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">One of our key projects is the delivery of eye surgery to the displaced people of Burma; last financial year we undertook 2015 operations. Our main facility on the Thai-Burmese border is Mae Tao Clinic in Mae Sot, which is run by the internationally recognised Dr Cynthia Maung. This was visited by a Douglas Alexander during his time as Secretary of State for International Development, and he sent message to us subsequently that our work was exactly what DFID wanted to support, and we should apply for funding. This we did, seeking advice on the process, but were unsuccessful. To their credit, DFID ran a series of seminars</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">to advise those who had failed on how to do better.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">I attended in my capacity as Chair of the Trustees of Karenaid, and as a member of the eye team who has worked on the border since 1990. Two related facts became clear, which I believe raises some important principles.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The first is that any organisation that is serious in expecting DFID support must be big enough to employ a full time fund raiser, which is excluding a considerable number of small but very effective and experienced participants.  The second point is that the application process was out-sourced to an agency who knew nothing of the Secretary of State’s personal interest in our applying. Whilst at one level that shouldn’t matter, it does reinforce the difficulty for small organisations to engage and also for DFID to deliver its intended objectives through them.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">I suggest that there is a place for DFID to have a specific stream of funding available to small organisations with a proven track record, for whom the application process is easier. Should funds be granted, the monitoring process must be one that they can reasonably handle with their limited administrative capacity. If such funds were modest, say £50-100,000, the risk would be small. To minimise the burden on DFID of establishing and monitoring these projects, they would need a simplified system internally. However, if this were established, it would enable DFID to engage through these organisations a section of Burmese society that they are likely to miss on the grander scale projects. They could then through these organisations use this population as a measure of whether the changes in Burma are enabling displaced people to return; a form of “focus group”, though I dislike that term.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:16pt; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">Conclusion</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">It is our view that DFID needs to develop a strategy of engagement of smaller organisations with experience of the situation in Burma. To do this they need a more flexible approach. This will compliment the larger scale projects which it is rightly taking forward. Such a dual approach will avoid </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">the exclusion</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> of marginalised groups in Burma, and help build a stable democracy</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">October 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
