The importance of these is underlined by the data above, which shows that conventional schooling (Key Stage 1 through to G</span><span style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book'; font-size:11pt">CSEs) is not delivering for these young people as effectively as for other groups, resulting in a way-below-average performance at age sixteen.

It should, though, direct them to increase opportunities for all learners to pursue other pathways instead. The Government’s focus on increasing the number of Apprenticeships is therefore right,</span><span style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book'; font-size:11pt"> and should deliver – over time – for white learners in deprived areas; similarly, the Government is right to enable colleges such as ours to recruit 14-16 year olds directly. These opportunities, and more, will enable young white people – and others – to </span><span style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book'; font-size:11pt">find the education and training best suited to them. However, the Government’s mixed messaging around the value of vocational qualifications stands at odds with these impressive aspirations. If Government is serious about improving access to vocational pat</span><span style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book'; font-size:11pt">hways – and the increased achievement of white children which will come with that – it cannot pursue policies such as the English Baccalaureate, which suggest that academic subjects are more valuable; it should cease with the patronising labelling proposed</span><span style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book'; font-size:11pt"> for vocational qualifications; and it should ensure that –as well as increasing the number of Apprenticeships – the system and brand work more effectively than at present. This should include developing a central admissions portal for Apprenticeships (as </span><span style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book'; font-size:11pt">with UCAS for HE), and improving mechanisms to monitor the value of Apprenticeships – for example, by publishing a metric showing the number of students achieving Apprenticeships with companies the equivalent of Gove’s favoured Russell Group universities, </span><span style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book'; font-size:11pt">and by bringing assessment methods more into line with their A level counterparts. These recommendations, amongst others, will make the vocational pathways more attractive to students and employers, and will enable young white learners – who often respond </span><span style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book'; font-size:11pt">particularly well to such provision – to stem their tide of underperformance.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="14" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Book'; font-size:11pt">Where we have agreed strongly with Government policy is in reducing the number of vocational qualifications counting towards league tables.
