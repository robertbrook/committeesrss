This research, </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">titled: 'Rural Public Transport Network Design', investigated whether public transport networks (mainly bus transport) in rural areas can be designed in response to the accessibility and social needs of a population. The aim was to have a piece of academic</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt"> research that could be used alongside actual passenger data when analysing and reviewing subsidised bus services.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">It also compared the differences between a rural transport network that has developed over time and is based on passenger data against a the</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">oretical transport network that has routes based on research and academic literature.The methodology used identifies the demand for public transport by residents (Origins) for accessing key services (Destinations). Once this is established, two different m</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">ethods (Scenario 1 and 2) are used to connect people to places. In Scenario 1, GIS Mapping software is used to create a rural public transport network which can be compared to the existing transport network and analysis made. Scenario 2 seeks to highlight </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">key connections and interchanges across the East Riding network as opposed to specific routes. I think the work is particularly relevant to the first 3 questions that the Committee is seeking information on: identify demand for passenger transport in isola</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">ted communities, how the different needs of different passengers are taken into account in determining public transport, and what are the main challenges facing rural passengers.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt 12pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">The research is yet to be published, but will be submitted as a </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">Dissertatio</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">n for a MSc in Transport Planning at the Institute of Transport Studies (University of Leeds).
