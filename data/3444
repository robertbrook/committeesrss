Most notably, the conclusions and recommendations of the Committee’s report into Presumption of Death were largely implemented via John Glen’s Private Members Bill, which received Royal Assent in March 2013</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">; and the Director of Public Prosecutions published guidance on Joint Enterprise in December 2012, and has agreed to collect better data on such prosecutions, as per the recommendations of that inquiry</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">.

At that meeting, Members decided that, rather than identifying and publishing an overarching set of strategic objectives, they would continue to discuss, roughly once a quarter, their short, medium and long-term work programme, and carry out a mix of reactive and pro-active inquiries. Broadly speaking, the Committee’s objectives are to undertake work (and, as appropriate follow-up work) on all the major areas of the MoJ’s responsibility over the course of the Parliament, to scrutinise the work of all the Ministry’s </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">main </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">non-departmental bodies, and to fulfil the core tasks as far as possible. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Focus of inquiries</span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">The Committee routinely considers what it hopes to achieve from inquiries, and their likely impact on Government, through options papers and scoping notes as part of the inquiry planning process. For example, the structure of recent work on proposed reforms to legal aid and probation services was determined by considerations as to whether, when and how the Committee could add value. The Committee has not adopted the practice of agreeing a minute before the start of inquiries setting out what it hopes to achieve. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Evidence sessions</span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">The Committee initially agreed to use the rapporteur role for visits rather than for evidence sessions or inquiries, in the first instance.

The Committee concurs that the principles of diversity and inclusion should be taken into account in planning its programme and had previously agreed to vary its usual meeting time where it would be difficult for witnesses (for example, those who live far from London or who have caring responsibilities) to attend early morning sessions. As a result, an afternoon session was held in order to take evidence from the families of young people who had died in custody and this option has been offered to witnesses on further occasions. It has also agreed to take evidence in private in order to hear from witnesses who feel constrained from giving public evidence, for example from ex-offenders in the Women Offenders inquiry.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; letter-spacing:-0.15pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; letter-spacing:-0.15pt">Professional development</span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; letter-spacing:-0.15pt">At its March meeting the Committee decided not to request training in questioning skills, as it considered that a more ‘professional’ style might not be appropriate.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; letter-spacing:-0.15pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; letter-spacing:-0.15pt">Committee behaviour</span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; letter-spacing:-0.15pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; letter-spacing:-0.15pt">Witnesses are always treated with respect and courtesy and given a fair hearing.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; letter-spacing:-0.15pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; letter-spacing:-0.15pt">Scrutiny of European matters</span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; letter-spacing:-0.15pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; letter-spacing:-0.15pt">The Committee has not chosen to appoint formally a European rapporteur at this stage but the C</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; letter-spacing:-0.15pt">hair has acted as a de facto</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; letter-spacing:-0.15pt"> rapporteur in attending a number of EU conferences in a representative capacity.
