A relevant undertaking will be one where it is a “prescribed description”, or it affects, by the way it is conducted, other people by exposing them to risks to their health and safety. This does not cover the self employed person themselves. It is not known what the “prescribed descriptions” will be as this will be decided by the Secretary of State in regulations.</span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The proposal came about from the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Lofstedt</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Review of Health and safety regulation published in November 2011, where he proposed “exempting from health and safety law those self-employed whose work activities pose no potential risk of harm to others”. In autumn 2012 the HSE conducted a consultation on the recommendation, putting forward various options, but not asking for a view on the principle. The preferred option, which is the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">one</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> proposed in the Draft Bill, had a majority of respondents opposed to it.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The TUC has campaigned against this proposal because it would create confusion and uncertainty in a sector which already has a much higher fatality, injury and ill-health rate. There is currently a fatality rate of 1.1 per 100,000 for the self-employed as against 0.4 per 100,000 for employees. It is also opposed by the health and safety professionals’ body, IOSH, who say, “This is a very short-sighted and misleading move, it won’t actually help anyone; it won’t support business; but it will cause general confusion.”</span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">At present, if you are self-employed, you have a legal duty to ensure that you protect others from harm resulting from your work activity. This covers all self-employed people. It is straightforward and it works. There is no confusion and it means that everyone is very clear that no-one, even if they are self-employed, can take risks with others safety or health. </span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The changes proposed in the Draft Bill are completely unnecessary as the only time the Health and Safety at Work Act can be used is in circumstances whereby the person does put another person at risk. If they injure another person through their work, regardless of what they may have believed beforehand, the Health and Safety at Work Act will apply. </span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Nor is there any need to change the duty of a self-employed person not to injure </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">themselves</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">No self-employed person has ever been prosecuted or threatened with prosecution only for risking their own health, however the Health and Safety at Work Act means that the HSE has been able to give them guidance on how to protect their own </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">safety. Cases where self-employed people have been prosecuted have been where they also risked the safety of others such as window-cleaners and </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">scaffolders</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">.</span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Despite this Draft Bill, every self-employed person is still going to have to do a risk assessment to see if their work poses a risk to others and if there is no risk there is no problem, just the same as now. That will not change. </span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">What will change is the confusion and complacency that it will bring. Self-employed people will be unsure if they are covered, or presume that they are not especially if they are not on the proscribed list of occupations or sectors (presuming they know about it). Even many people that clearly do pose a danger will think that they now have nothing to worry about so will believe that there is no need for any safety precautions. </span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Worse still people who control the workplace where self-employed people work (often bogus-self-employed) will wrongly think that they do not have any duty of care to them. Self-employed people who employ others may interpret it as meaning that they are exempt from the law.</span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Given that the most dangerous industries all have a high proportion of self-employed people in them (agriculture, construction etc.) anything that confuses the situation is a recipe for disaster. </span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The Bill states that the proposals are being done “for the reduction of burdens resulting from legislation for businesses or other organisations or for individuals”. In fact it does the opposite as it does not actually change the situation for those who genuinely do not pose a risk to others and only creates complete confusion for all the other self-employed.</span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt; page-break-after:avoid"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Clause 2: Tribunal’s powers to make wider recommendations. </span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The TUC opposes clause 2 of the draft Bill which would remove the power of Employment Tribunals to issue wider recommendations to employers found to have unlawfully discriminated. </span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Prior to the introduction</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">of this power in the Equality Act 2010, a Tribunal could only provide a remedy to successful claimants, but not recommend to an employer address the root causes of such discrimination.

In seven cases, respondents were asked to address equality issues generally or to review policies. </span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Such recommendations are made by a Tribunal judge and two lay members, including one representing business, after considering all evidence at a full hearing.

For example: </span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt 28.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">In </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Stone v Ramsay Health Care</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">, the Tribunal said that there was a “thorough and abject failure by the [employer] to have protected the claimant from pregnancy and maternity discrimination”. The Tribunal recommended training for senior managers and HR on maternity and pregnancy rights and to redraft their equal opportunity policies. In making these recommendations the Tribunal stated that it “was of concern to us given the considerable resource of this respondent and the likelihood that it employs considerable numbers of women”.</span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt 28.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">In </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Crisp v Iceland Foods</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">, a HR manager’s awareness of mental disability was “no less than woeful” according to the Tribunal.

The net total benefits of repealing the provisions for private and voluntary sector employers are estimated to be between £0 and £10,000 according to the government.</span><a name="_ftnref5"></a><a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Without such recommendations, many bad employers would fail to address the causes of discrimination. The government cites research that shows that 54 percent of employers the subject of a discrimination claim “make at least one change” to their practices following the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">case.</span><a name="_ftnref6"></a><a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> However the TUC is deeply concerned about the 46 percent of employers who do nothing despite having a claim against them. As the cases above show employers who have been subject to a Tribunal recommendation had engaged in such poor practices that they were likely to continue breaching the Equality Act unless steps were taken. </span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The government has also claimed that “because the recommendations are non-binding, we feel that these provisions are not having a significant impact on employer behaviour”.</span><a name="_ftnref7"></a><a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> But it cannot credibly claim that this power is both irrelevant and excessive at the same time. If the government truly wanted to make the recommendations more effective it could make them binding on employers.  </span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The TUC believes that the government’s Impact Assessment (IA) of August 2012 is flawed for three key reasons.  </span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Firstly, the full benefits of employers implementing recommendations have not been captured. The IA assumes that the only monetary benefit of recommendations is a slight reduction in Tribunal claims. However, there are broader benefits to the workplace and employment practices as extensively documented in the literature review cited above that the IA acknowledges, but does not quantify. </span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Secondly, the government has failed to adequately consider the equality impact of the repeal. It claims that the repeal will have “no significant impact on any of the protected characteristics”, largely because employers already “make changes following a finding of discrimination against them”.</span><a name="_ftnref8"></a><a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> But even the IA states that this only happens in 54% of cases, and even then, it is not clear if such changes are as effective as those recommended by Tribunals.</span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Thirdly and </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">relatedly</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">, the IA is now badly out of date. It was conducted when Tribunals had only issued wider recommendations in four cases, leading the IA to conclude that there “was very little empirical evidence of the power’s usage and the positive impact that it may have had”.</span><a name="_ftnref9"></a><a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> This was unsurprising given the newness of the provision, but even then the government failed to examine the equality impact of the recommendations in those cases. According to the EOR, there are now at least 28 cases which should be examined as part of any credible and improved impact assessment.  </span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt; page-break-after:avoid"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Clauses 58 to 61: Exercise of regulatory functions: economic duty </span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">These clauses impose a new duty on some bodies that exercise certain regulatory functions to have regard, in the exercise of those functions, to the desirability of promoting economic growth.</span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The TUC believes that these clauses are not only unnecessary but also potentially damaging and in some cases likely to compromise the independence of some regulatory bodies, for example, the HSE and the EHRC, both of which are required under EU legislation to </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">operate at arm’s length from Government in the exercise of some of their statutory functions.</span><a name="_ftnref10"></a><a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Much of the wording in these clauses is opaque; clause 60 permits a Minister of the Crown to issue guidance as to the meaning of economic growth but on the face of the Bill there is no indication as to what the phrase means in practice. </span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Of course it is important that regulators do not set out to impede economic growth but providing a statutory duty obliging them to have regard to it in the exercise of their functions, with no clarity as to where and how this might operate is potentially going to interfere with their ability to perform their statutory duties.</span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">There is no indication as to how this new duty would be enforced and who would judge whether or not fulfilling the new duty would conflict with an existing duty to perform a particular function. There is a danger that those who are regulated will attempt to use this new duty to override the actions of the regulator. A business, for example, could argue that requiring a particular process to be undertaken before conducting a particular activity would prevent them from making a profit and thus reduce their ability to grow. On the other hand, not conducting the process could lead to an accident or illness of an employee. Which of these competing duties would prevail and who would decide?</span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The Government has already introduced a similar measure for the Pensions Regulator. The Pensions Bill establishes a new objective for the Pensions Regulator to ‘minimise any adverse impact on the sustainable growth of an employer of its defined benefit regulatory regime’. This is hugely controversial because it seems likely that employers will be able to point to this law as a reason to reduce, for instance, deficit recovery contributions – which means defined benefit pension </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">schemes</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> are more likely to close. A growth objective may impede the Regulator’s primary function of protecting pension scheme member benefits.</span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The Government should provide evidence either that the Hampton Principles are not being applied or that they do not work. We have not seen any evidence to this end produced by the Government in support of this proposal. </span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The TUC urges the Government to drop these clauses and consider other non legislative ways of encouraging regulators to adopt a balanced approach to their statutory functions. There is no evidence that regulation is needed in order to achieve this: indeed the Coalition Parties, when in Opposition, ridiculed the previous Government for introducing the socio-economic duty in the Equality Act 2010 and have subsequently decided not to enact it. It is not clear why they now believe that legislation of this kind is necessary or will be effective in promoting economic growth. Furthermore it is potentially damaging as it may reduce safety and well being for employees and citizens.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">22 August 2013</span></p><p style="line-height:11pt; margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Arial Narrow'; font-size:8pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger 45'; font-size:11pt">3</span></p></div><hr style="width:33%; height:1px; text-align:left" /><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn1"></a><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a><span style="font-family:'Frutiger 45'; font-size:9pt"> GEO (August 2012) Impact Assessment of removing the power to make wider recommendations page 1, at: </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/136234/ia-wider-recommendations.pdf"><span style="color:#0000ff; font-family:'Frutiger 45'; font-size:9pt; text-decoration:underline">https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/136234/ia-wider-recommendations.pdf</span></a><span style="font-family:'Frutiger 45'; font-size:9pt"> </span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn2"></a><a href="#_ftnref2">[2]</a><span style="font-family:'Frutiger 45'; font-size:9pt"> Equal Opportunities Review Issue 237, 24 May 2013. </span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn3"></a><a href="#_ftnref3">[3]</a><span style="font-family:'Frutiger 45'; font-size:9pt"> See e.g. Equality and Human Rights Commission (2011) </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger 45'; font-size:9pt; font-style:italic">Employment Statutory Code of Practice</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger 45'; font-size:9pt"> chapter 18; CBI and TUC (2008), </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger 45'; font-size:9pt; font-style:italic">Talent not Tok</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger 45'; font-size:9pt; font-style:italic">enism, the business benefits of</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger 45'; font-size:9pt; font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger 45'; font-size:9pt; font-style:italic">workforce </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger 45'; font-size:9pt; font-style:italic">diversity</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger 45'; font-size:9pt"> at </span><a href="http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/uploaded_files/talentnottokenism.pdf"><span style="color:#0000ff; font-family:'Frutiger 45'; font-size:9pt; text-decoration:underline">http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/uploaded_files/talentnottokenism.pdf</span></a><span style="font-family:'Frutiger 45'; font-size:9pt">; and Employers Network for Equality and Inclusion (ENEI) generally at </span><a href="http://www.enei.org.uk/pages/training-consultancy.html"><span style="color:#0000ff; font-family:'Frutiger 45'; font-size:9pt; text-decoration:underline">http://www.enei.org.uk/pages/training-consultancy.html</span></a><span style="font-family:'Frutiger 45'; font-size:9pt"> </span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn4"></a><a href="#_ftnref4">[4]</a><span style="font-family:'Frutiger 45'; font-size:9pt"> BIS/GEO (January 2013), </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger 45'; font-size:9pt; font-style:italic">The Business Case for Equality and Diversity</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger 45'; font-size:9pt">, page 28 </span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn5"></a><a href="#_ftnref5">[5]</a><span style="font-family:'Frutiger 45'; font-size:9pt"> GEO page 7 </span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn6"></a><a href="#_ftnref6">[6]</a><span style="font-family:'Frutiger 45'; font-size:9pt"> GEO page 5</span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn7"></a><a href="#_ftnref7">[7]</a><span style="font-family:'Frutiger 45'; font-size:9pt"> GEO page 1</span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn8"></a><a href="#_ftnref8">[8]</a><span style="font-family:'Frutiger 45'; font-size:9pt"> GEO page 15</span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn9"></a><a href="#_ftnref9">[9]</a><span style="font-family:'Frutiger 45'; font-size:9pt"> GEO page 12</span></p><p style="line-height:15pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7pt"><a name="_ftn10"></a><a href="#_ftnref10">[10]</a><span style="font-family:'Frutiger 45'; font-size:9pt"> The EHRC is required to meet international standards of independence and effective functioning under the United Nations Paris Principles for National Human Rights Institutions which risks being compromised by these clauses. </span></p></body></html>
