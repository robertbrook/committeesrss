Our concern remains that such individuals as well as those who have been in the UK for many years but with no status will not qualify for any legal assistance to regularise their status due the residence test. The aim of the test is to only</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt"> provide legal aid to those with a strong connection to the UK.

H left foster care at 18, at</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">tended college and at 20 met a British national with whom she had a child. Her daughter was given British nationality. The couple did not stay together and H was a single mother. Her studies had finished and she stayed with a friend in her flat. She wanted</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt"> to start working to provide for her herself and her daughter but realised she could not do so as she had no proof of her immigration status. She was also unable to claim any benefits and survived with the help of college friends.

After not hearing anything for several months she contacted the Home Office again and once again was asked to supply evidence which she did. Three years later with</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt"> no response and after having repeatedly sending evidence she contacted solicitors.

It allows th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">e enforcement of the Rule of Law. It is therefore of concern that Government proposed to remove payment for pre-permission work done on the case unless the Court grants permission for the application to proceed. Judicial review is specialist, top heavy wor</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">k, which means most of the work is done at the outset. If permission is not granted by the Court on a paper application there is the option to renew and ask for an oral hearing seeking permission. This means filing further grounds and instructing a barrist</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">er to attend the High Court for the hearing. If payment is depended on outcome many solicitors will simply not take a risk of lodging judicial reviews as few firms can afford the risk of not being paid for several days worth of work especially at a time wh</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">ere the existing Legal Aid cuts have made times very difficult for existing practices. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:14pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">The Government's consultation response has been to introduce further consultation specifically on judicial review. It has suggested that pre-permission work could be p</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">aid at the discretion of the Legal Aid Agency (LAA). This appears a completely unworkable model with few solicitors willing to stake livelihood on the LAA's discretion. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:14pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">JCWI has not had a chance to fully address the new consultation but will be providing</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt"> a detailed response to it shortly and would be happy to share this with the Committee. As an initial comment it is with grave concern that we note the Government's proposal to change the test for 'standing'. At the moment rightly and correctly judicial re</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">view proceedings can only be brought by somebody who has sufficient interest in the application. The current test for standing is prescribed in section 31(1) of the Senior Courts Act 1981, and requires that the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">court should not grant leave for an applicati</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">on for judicial review to be made unless the court “considers that the claimant has a sufficient interest in the matter to which the application relates”. This test has been interpreted by the courts as including cases where it is in the public interest fo</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">r an issue to be examined. The consultation quite clearly states that the Government thinks this is too wide and that its actions shouldn’t be challenged in the public interest. It says, “The concern is based on the principle that Parliament and the electe</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">d Government are best placed to determine what is in the public interest.” JCWI is gravely concerned that the Government is seeking to undermine the rule of law by removing the checks and balances that judiciary provide in controlling the executive.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:14pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt; font-weight:bold">3.

A borderline case is not a case without merit or one that is doomed to fail. These cases would not be funded at pubic expense and that is rightly so. But </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">a borderline case is often one where legal opinions differ and until tested there is no way on knowing whether the client would have succeeded. This is of particular significance in areas where individuals lives are fundamentally impacted, for example in s</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:14pt">ecuring liberty or legal status. The current legal aid guidance says legal aid will be provided in borderline cases where it is 'of overwhelming importance to the individual'.
