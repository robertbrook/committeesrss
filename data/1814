First, we recognised that central government spent around £240billion a year upon procuring goods and services with local government spending some £72billion. We wanted to understand the impact this spend was bringing for local economies in terms of jobs, spend in deprived areas, and supporting and sustaining local and small business. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10pt">1.2</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10pt">Second, we recognised that there was an often uncomfortably bureaucratic approach to public procurement in local authorities and other public sector institutions; with significant evidence of risk adversity and silo working. We wanted to change the cultural mindset of local authority procurement officers and bring procurement to the forefront of local government’s place stewardship and leadership role. In times of austerity, we felt that procurement needed to be a key mechanism in fostering wider public service transformation.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10pt">1.3</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10pt">Third, we recognised that there was an intrinsic link between the function of procurement and local economic development and growth and that procurement was not being fully maximised to bring economic, social and environmental benefit. We wanted to ensure every pound of investment by public authorities in goods and services reaped maximum benefit for places and communities. This was not just an aim for procurers, but also suppliers in utilising spend both more effectively and efficiently. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10pt">1.4</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10pt">Our response to these three reasons and indeed frustrations has been a programme of work focused upon demonstrating the benefit of procurement spend and also shifting mindsets and cultures amongst both procurers and suppliers.

Where these factors are evident in abundance and embedded in procurement strategy, local authorities are well organised to deliver value for money, and social, economic and environmental objectives. Where these factors are not evident, where there is a risk adverse culture in relation to procurement, and where the primary emphasis of procurement policy is upon cost; then local government are far less organised.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 35.45pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-35.45pt"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10pt">2.2</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10pt">To illustrate the point about cultural mindset, the following case study of Manchester City Council highlights how that particular authority has instigated more progressive procurement practice.   Manchester City Council’s work around sustainable and progressive procurement commenced in 2008 with the development of a bespoke procurement model and complimentary Sustainable Procurement Policy.  The premise behind the model was that procurement needed to be treated as a cycle if it was to be more efficient and effective. The Sustainable Procurement Policy had two core and relatively succinct priorities:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 49.65pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-14.2pt"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:10pt; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 45.05pt; padding-left:4.6pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10pt">to ensure that balanced consideration of social, environmental and economic impacts are undertaken throughout the procurement process;</span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:10pt; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 45.05pt; padding-left:4.6pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10pt">to ensure Manchester City Council employees, contractors and suppliers are aware of the Council’s commitment to long term social, ethical, environmental and economic sustainability.</span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 35.45pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-35.45pt"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10pt">2.3</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10pt">Manchester City Council knew that the corporate and cyclical approach to procurement had already had an effect upon making efficiencies; however they did not know the extent of the impact the Sustainable Procurement Policy was having upon the Manchester economy and the behaviour of suppliers. CLES was therefore commissioned in 2009 to explore the contribution of spend to the local economy. The analysis effectively provided a baseline for where Manchester City Council’s procurement spend was going in 2008/09; and a starting point for further engagement to enable the maximisation of benefit.  The findings of the initial research were positive:</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt;
