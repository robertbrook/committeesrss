The problem is the lapse of time.

When we are looking at the case 30 or 40 years on, that adult is now perhaps into their 80s. The people who were their contemporaries at the time, if we can trace them at all, may be deceased or unwell. If you are talking about, say, a care home, that care home may long since have gone out of business; the records may no longer exist. In a sense, it is linked to 13(1) because you have to find something new in order to put your case to the Court of Appeal, but the real problem, as with any old case, is finding any of the evidence at all, including things such as the original court transcripts.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q28 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir Alan Beith (</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">)</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Of course, in many of these cases, those who are pursuing them will take the view that a lack of evidence on the prosecution side demonstrates that the case is not made out against them and might not at a later date have</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> been treated in the sa</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">me way, and that in some cases they were convicted before it became clear that there might have been excessive </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">use of similar fact evidence or</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> that police information about times and dates when people were in particular institutions did not tally.

Society almost stumbles upon a new class of offence or realises that it is more extant than had previously been thought. One looks at what has happened on the back of Jimmy Savile, for example; suddenly there is a very large exercise. Of course, what can happen in a situation like that, when there is very considerable public interest or press scrutiny and a lot of intense pressure on the prosecution team to get results, is that innocent p</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">eople can be swept up in it. We</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> see that pattern repeated on a number of occasions.

Does that present any problems, despite the power being there? Of course, a lot of these public functions are now in the hands of private bodies, and we are transferring ever more. There seems to be a glaring need to extend that legislation to private bodies.

That is something that well-meaning officials have been telling us since 2006, I think. You are precisely right. A large number of bodies that were public bodies have either moved to the private sector or are in the process of doing so. They are bodies whose information is vital to our inquiries—the forensic science service, probation, parts of the police and parts of the health service. If we are looking at issues </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">like</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> the reliability of a witness, it is absolutely essential that we have these records.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The section 17 power—that is to say, the power to obtain private as well as public documents—is a power that the Scottish CCRC has had since its inception. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">They do it in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">the way we would feel comfortable d</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">oing it as well—</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">by way </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">of application to the court.
