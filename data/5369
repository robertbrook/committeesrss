It had taken us over two hours by taxi to get to the airport from our home in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">Tadworth</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">, Surrey, a journey which would normally have</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt"> taken about twenty minutes. There was no information on any of the electronic boards, and no staff to make verbal announcements. We stood for about three and a half hours before reaching a check-in desk, only about three of which were manned. During this </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">time we saw no representative from the airline, and were offered no refreshment.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">Once checked in we were issued with boarding passes, but we had to manually take our luggage and deposit it in the middle of the check-in area. We then proceeded through immi</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">gration, security and to the departure lounge.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">The information desk was manned by one Thomson employee, who could provide no information about our flight. During the whole afternoon, the desk was manned by armed police. There was no information on the ele</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">ctronic boards, and no sign of any airline representative. The lounge was very full, and at no time were we offered any form of information, or refreshment. Fortunately we had taken food with us to consume on the plane, and by the time we got to the depart</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">ure lounge we were starving and very thirsty. It was just as well because we had no idea if the flight was going or not, and therefore it was far </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">to</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt"> risky to buy a sit down meal.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">We discovered from another passenger that our flight was not leaving Christm</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">as Eve and we were being put up in the Sofitel. This information was unofficial, since there was no Thomson, or any other official to impart this information. We had no option but to believe the rumour, so at about 6.00pm we decided to abandon the departur</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">e lounge and take the passage out, which was manned, through immigration and the exit. There was no Thomson representative at the exit, so we proceeded to the hotel, but via Boots the chemist to buy some essential toiletries, toothbrushes, paste, deodorant</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">, at our own cost, since we did not have our luggage. We had tried to find our luggage, unsuccessfully, since there were still many cases piled up at check-in. There was absolutely no information about our luggage, although we had already enquired at the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">S</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">wissport</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt"> desk at luggage reclaim. They were unable to provide any information, and did not know where any luggage was located.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">The Sofitel were expecting passengers, and their check-in process was reasonably </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">smoothe</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">, but there was no information about our</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt"> flight. We were advised that dinner would be provided, but only between 6.30 and 8.30pm. We purchased some very expensive drinks, and then went to dinner. Dinner was not in the main dining room, but in a large room in the basement. It was a shambles, not </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">enough seating so some people were standing up eating. The food was meagre. Tables were strewn with dirty plates etc., and we had to ask a member of staff to clear us two places to sit and eat. There was no choice, the soup was </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">luke</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt"> warm (no bread, althoug</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">h some people had rolls),a very small piece of chicken, mixed vegetables and potatoes which we had to wait for because they had run out. Absolutely no choice, thankfully we are not vegetarians. After that, we treated ourselves to another very expensive dri</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">nk.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">Whilst at the hotel we sent an internet message to Thomson Airways from their website, requesting information about our flight. We eventually received a standard reply on 27</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:6.67pt; vertical-align:super">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt"> December, which was not at all helpful, and of no use.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">We decided to see i</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">f we could find our luggage, so we returned to the airport check-in at about 9.30pm. We managed to find a very helpful </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">Swissport</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt"> employee who arranged for us to go through security and to baggage re-claim where it seemed all the checked-in baggage was now </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">located. Baggage re-claim was a mass of people, with suitcases everywhere, all over the floor and on the carousels. Using our ingenuity, we eventually managed to find our two suitcases, and returned to the hotel via immigration.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">When we arrived back at th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">e hotel at about 10.30pm, there was now a notice displayed in the lobby advising us that the flight was now expected to leave from the south terminal at 8.20am on Christmas Day. It said we should be at check-in three hours before departure.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">We discovered </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">that passengers on our flight who booked flights direct with Thomson Airways had received an e-mail from Thomson, advising them about financial compensation and details of the new flight on Christmas Day. We were booked with a tour operator (Prestige Holid</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">ays) through a travel agent (Castaways in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">Tadworth</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">) and received nothing from any organisation. There was a ‘Dunkirk spirit’ amongst passengers, which is how many people found out information. We went to bed !</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">We arrived at the hotel lobby at 5.00am hopin</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">g to get a bit of breakfast or at least a cup of coffee before setting off for the south terminal. The staff were very off hand with us. Breakfast was not available for us, although the main breakfast room was manned and ready for service. We were forbidde</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">n from using it. Packed breakfasts were supposed to be available, but there were none ready. So we left with no breakfast or drink, shortly after 5.00am. The staff were not helpful, regardless of the fact that it was Christmas morning. We felt during the w</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">hole of our stay that we were second class citizens, which is how we were treated, and the staff were only interested in full paying clients, who had all facilities available to them.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">So, we made our way to the south terminal, where things seemed reasonab</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">ly normal. We checked in, and were given two five pound vouchers to spend in the departure lounge. This was the only ‘give away’ and it did not even provide us with a breakfast, but we did use it towards our breakfast.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">We took off at about 8.45am and were</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt"> given one free drink during the flight. Our holiday from then on went smoothly.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">In conclusion, it was an awful experience, and it appears that whatever contingency plans the airport and Thomson Airways had (if any ?) did not work, and there were just not</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt"> enough staff on duty to cope with the situation. We appreciate that the situation was caused by the weather, but there was enough notice in the news about the expected bad weather, for the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">management’s</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt"> of both Gatwick Airport and Thomson Airways to have f</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">oreseen likely problems and taken remedial action.
