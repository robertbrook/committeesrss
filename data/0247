Although FSPs are required by their clients (police) to obtain ISO accreditation; they place no such burden on themselves to provide this service. Some forces have </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">voluntarily</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> taken the accreditation route but others have </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">shied</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> away. </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt 5pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">In the past few years the FSS carried out very little research other than associated with DNA and its contribution to broader forensic research has been over estimated.

The purpose of the National Forensic Framework Agreement was to encourage a range of service providers. It has not done so. The process of tendering is complex and discourages SME’s. Several companies have withdrawn from the framework. In addition, some of the major providers have adopted a policy of offering </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">unsustainably cheap prices to obtain the work and eliminate alternative providers. This, ultimately, will mean the police will have fewer providers to choose from and ultimately higher uncontested prices.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt 5pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Increasingly, the use of police “in-sourcing” of forensic science services has further destabilised the market. Although, in our view, there is a place for screening and selection of forensic exhibits at the source (police force) it needs to be done</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> carefully. Many of the “business cases” we have seen for in sourcing have been spurious if not creative.</span></p><ol start="6" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; margin:5pt 0pt 5pt 32pt; padding-left:4pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">How are forensic science services procured by police forces and could procurement processes be improved?</span></li></ol><p style="margin:5pt 0pt 5pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Virtually all police work is via mini competitions through the National Framework Agreement.
