In other words, I am exploring the relationship that you have to the Secretary of State. How does that work and how independent does that make you feel?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Atkinson</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: As Children’s Commissioner for </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> I do not report to the Secretary of State; I am a corporation sole. Unlike the Commissioner that is proposed in this draft Bill, I can appoint staff, I can let contracts and I can intervene. I do not have the power to institute judicial review, but it is possible that I may, after the Children and Families Bill, subject to the will of Parliament, becomes an Act.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">The Commissioner as described in the draft Bill is actually a member of staff of the Home Office. In conversations at my office over the draft, as I prepared to come for this session, it becomes a bit problematic, we think, </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">to call it a Commissioner because it can’t commission anything. If you look at the National Human Rights Institution, which is the EHRC, its members are Commissioners. I am Children’s Commissioner for </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">. There are four of us in the </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">. All of us are separate from, although we relate to, Government. I am Government-funded, as are the other three in the other three </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> nations. My remit letter, which arrives with me to tell me how much my budget will be for the coming financial year, cannot and therefore does not tell me what to do. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">The Secretary of State may not like what I have to say in my annual report, but he is very clear, and has been clear in the House, that he will neither interfere nor attempt to direct. Although the 2004 Act which set me up permits the Secretary of State so to do, when we were reviewed in 2010 he made a statement in receiving the review report that he would no longer seek to direct my activities. He makes very reasoned requests that we provide him with material, and whenever it is possible—and it does not fetter my independence—we do so.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">The explanatory notes to the draft Bill are very useful, I think, for your pre-legislative scrutiny purposes. The Commissioner as described in the draft Bill is a member of the Home Secretary’s staff. The Home Secretary may alter both the plans and the annual report that that post holder creates, presents and publishes. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">I very strongly welcome the fact that Government want to legislate on the heinous crimes as described by the Home Secretary that the Bill seeks to address. I can’t help saying to you, in your pre-legislative mode, that, as currently drafted, the Bill rather conflates trafficking and slavery and enslavement, which are not the same things as each other. It might help debates in either House were you to point out some of the issues that may need to be readdressed in a Bill that is going to make the difference that this Bill seeks to make.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q39 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mrs Spelman:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> We will ask you questions about definitions later on and it will be really, really interesting to drill into those distinctions, but my little crop of questions is focused round this issue of how we make the Commissioner independent. You have hinted at some of the tools in your toolkit that allow you to assert your independence, but could you point us to the most important of those and also the most important tools to assure your accountability?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Atkinson</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: The ones I have just highlighted are one set, which is very much about how we are governed, how we run ourselves as an organisation, and how I set my priorities in response to what children, policymakers and academic research are saying. But there is then a second set about the ways in which the 2004 Act stipulated what the powers of the Commissioner shall be.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">I have the power to enter any premises where a child is deemed cared for, apart from their private home. We do go in and out of youth justice custodial settings on no notice. The Governor can’t say, “Well, we’re busy.” We can and do go in and out of asylum settings, which is where many of the trafficked children who could otherwise become enslaved are found. We can and do go in and out of social care settings. In the inheritance that we will pick up from the Office of the Children’s Rights Director, my intention is that we do a programme of visits to children’s homes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">That sense of powers, which cannot be gainsaid, is really important in the life of a Children’s Commissioner. We are not an ombudsman. We cannot direct and we do not regulate. We do not hold professions to account. What we do do is stand in a space that I would define as serious moral authority. That is because I can and do—and the Act is very explicit—appoint such staff as I deem fit to assure that my remit is fulfilled. The explanatory notes to this draft Bill make it very clear indeed that this Commissioner will not have that power.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">We do not have to be accommodated in the same buildings as Government should we choose not to be, although there is very strong pressure that we remain on Crown Estate. I do not have to put up with the Secretary of State saying, “That’s your desk,” and I do not think he would want to. It will be an uncomfortable period of time if any Anti-Slavery Commissioner were to have to say something which, from the evidence gained as part of the way they do their job, means that what they have to say is uncomfortable for Government, whoever that Government may be. There are moments when what I say is absolutely in support of what Ministers have pushed through—for instance, some of the amendments to the Children and Families Bill going through now. I am delighted when I can say that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">There are moments when what I have to say is deeply uncomfortable for the media, for politics and for wider society. I cannot hesitate in doing that and in saying what needs to be said. If there is going to be an Anti-Slavery Commissioner who is going to be worthy of that name, there will be moments of deep discomfort with any stamp of politician who happens then to be Home Secretary. The greater the distance that can be put in legislation between that person and any politician, the better, it seems to me. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q40 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mrs Spelman:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> To create that independence, where would you ideally locate the Commissioner?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Atkinson</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: I do not see there being a problem in this person being a member of the staff of the Home Office, as long as the legislation is honest in that that is what it is going to be. Calling it a Commissioner may lead to confusion with the model that is currently described in the draft Bill.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">I think it is a Home Office function—of course it is—because it is about crime and it is about justice, as well as being about immigration for some people who are trafficked into the country across borders. Therefore, the area of Government is absolutely right. It is whether or not you can truly call it an independent office, when it is very clear from the description in both the Bill and the explanatory notes that that is not what it is going to be, because the Home Secretary can direct what goes into the plan and the annual report. So it is less about where it sits than how it is described.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Now, were it a hugely independent model, it would need a memorandum of understanding with me because, under the Children and Families Bill shortly to be enacted, subject to the will of Parliament, I become </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">the</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> statutory champion for all of the rights of the child, which include enslavement, forced labour, trafficking, asylum, immigration, abuse and neglect. We would need an extremely strong memorandum of understanding in order to avoid stepping on each other’s toes. I do not think it is about them stepping on mine and not me on theirs. It would be about needing an extremely strong carving-out of the territory, which is the way we work with the Equalities and Human Rights Commission. We have regular conversations about the depth of our specialism for the under-18 population, although I recognise very clearly that they are the National Human Rights Institute.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Were this Commissioner to be strengthened and to become a truly independent office, they would need a memorandum of understanding with the EHRC as well. It is about being careful what you wish for, I guess. If we end up with something that is truly independent and there is a rowing back on, “It shall not be a corporation sole; it may not appoint its own staff; it will write up a report which is approved by the Home Secretary”—all of which I see as problematic, and you then ended up with somebody desperately strong—it would need a modus operandi of working with everybody else in the landscape.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q41 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Baroness Doocey:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Are there any examples of Commissioners or similar posts that you think it might be helpful for the Committee to examine?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Atkinson</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: There are endless models. Baroness O’Neill and Mark Hammond at the EHRC clearly work with a group of people who are appointed to the position of Commissioners at the EHRC. Anne Owers chairs the Independent Police Complaints Commission. The people who sit on that board are called Commissioners. If anybody speaks for the IPCC, it is a Commissioner—not the paid staff.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">There are many models. What you would have to do, probably, is to dismantle the model that is described in this Bill if you were going to institute one. I guess the greatest favour that you, as a pre-legislative </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">scrutiny committee, can do for both Houses is to help them to explore the potential difficulties of having somebody called a Commissioner who is actually a member of staff.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q42 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Baroness Doocey:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> I take the point you are making, but are there any of the models that are currently working that you think it would be helpful for us to look at in greater depth?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Atkinson</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: If I look at my opposite number in </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">, he is a royal appointment. He works not to any single Department in the Scottish Government or the Scottish Parliament, but through a special committee of the Scottish Parliament. He is still funded by the Scottish Government—of course he is—but, because he has the defence of being a royal appointment into that position, his independence, I think, is extremely strongly guarded, whether or not Scotland chooses to become an independent nation in September.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">All four UK Children’s Commissioners are also corporations sole and, therefore, are set aside from needing either an executive board or a group of non-executive directors. I will have an advisory board—I have one now—but they are purely advisory; they carry no risk or liability. There are elements of the models that set up all four of the </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">’s Children’s Commissioners that you might quite usefully look at. We are all corporations sole. None of us have an executive structure. If the buck stops anywhere, it stops at our desks—all of us. Only one of us is a royal appointment; the rest of us are not. We are all appointed to limited terms of office. Under the current legislation for me it is five years; under the coming legislation it will be six. There are elements of the legislation that say, “And you may, or you may not, be reappointed should the Secretary of State so deem.” </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">There are many, many models.

She is written into the constitution of the nation. She is called on by Ministers to run commissions of inquiry. I am not quite sure how you would resource an organisation to do that, but she is, and so are many European Children’s and Human Rights Commissioners. They are not only Commissioners; they are ombuds. There are endless models. It is what the nation decides should be that will be the crux.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q43 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Baroness Doocey:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Could you talk a little bit about how you co-ordinate your work with the other nations and what are the drawbacks—the pros and cons—of that in practice?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Atkinson</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: Where matters are devolved I have no say in what they do. We understand that between ourselves as a foursome.

In practice, we work to a memorandum of understanding, which we are in the process of revising now and will publish, probably in the spring. When we can, we work very closely together. On issues, for example, when yet again the UKBA—as it then was—wanted to use dental x-rays on teenage asylum seekers to prove their ages, we stepped in alongside the Chief Dental Officer and the Chief Medical Officer and had it stopped.

Yes, you are absolutely right that 25% of those who are trafficked and/or enslaved are under 18, but there are 12 million children in England, and any Children’s Commissioner—me or a successor following the passage of legislation—has to look to all 12 million of them wherever we possibly can, although obviously with a greater concentration on the most marginalised. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">I very strongly welcome the Home Office’s intention to strengthen efforts to address what—in the Home Secretary’s foreword is very clear—is a truly heinous crime, sometimes committed in plain sight, as she has </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">also said.

If you end up with somebody who is that powerful as a result of scrutiny through both Houses, then we would have to decide how we were going to work in the territory. Are we going to work jointly? Are we going to work as members of each other’s teams? If it remains as it is described in the Bill, then I come back to what I said earlier. I do not consider it a Commissioner.

They are extremely easy to exploit simply because it is very difficult for them to resist. My deputy cannot be here this morning, but I know some of you will have met her and she has given evidence. She speaks of meeting particularly teenage boys, who have been trafficked across the border from countries like </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Afghanistan</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> and some other Asian—including south Asian—nations, and made to commit crimes. Then, instead of being treated as victims, as the previous DPP insisted, they have been arrested, taken through the court process and are in prison because they were found growing cannabis, being used in sexual exploitation or whatever. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">They are victims. They are still greater victims because they are so young. Their ability to resist their exploiters is limited in comparison with that that adults could put up. Their ability to recover from trauma is, I would say, significantly different from the ability of an adult to be resilient enough to resist and to recover.

Could you comment again on the memorandums of understanding, if they are going to be broadened, as to how that would work in practice?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Atkinson</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: I think those very active verbs are very important. I am never quite sure how well, for example, very hard-pressed police services understand what it is they are looking at. Our work on sexual exploitation indicated that sometimes they don’t. Therefore, if there is somebody who is pressing good practice, showing people what it looks like when it works, and who is exemplifying through practice on the ground how others should be organised and operating, that is all to the good.

My own office has been part of lowering how much we’ve got since I came into office in 2010, and we do not expect to be immune from that.

Each time we have had a financial settlement since I came into office in March 2010, we have had to look all over again at who we have, how they are deployed and what the balance of skills is. If you look at where we have been since 2010, we have scaled down our back office; we have scaled down our communications team; we are at single specialisms. What we have managed to do, each time somebody has left or we have had to reconfigure, is to bring in more skill on the policy side of things.

In terms of the involvement of what used to be the UKBA, if I have given that impression, I apologise. That is not what I meant. Inevitably, for children who are trafficked in, they are the first team they meet at terminal 5 at Heathrow or wherever else. It is about how well trained they are. It is about how their radars are tuned to spot what is coming in, and it is about how consistent that is between the different ports and airports of entry.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q58 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> That is brilliant; thank you very much.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Atkinson</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: Not at all; thank you.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q59 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Fiona Mactaggart:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Could I just ask one sneaky question, Frank?

In terms of the draft Bill, how far do you think it helps us to meet our international legal obligations—for instance, the Council of Europe’s Anti-Trafficking Convention?

We would also obviously welcome the identification of the Anti-Slavery Commission as regards a National Rapporteur as required by the 2011 directive.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">One of our concerns is that there are clear minimum standards set out by the trafficking convention, the 2011 directive and the ECHR, and that currently the Modern Slavery Bill is very long on prosecution and enforcement and very quiet in relation to victim protection and a victim-centred approach. All three of those pieces of legislation—article 4 of the ECHR, the convention and the trafficking directive—have as their starting point a victim-centred approach.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Not to go much into it, but Joseph Raz described the ECHR as grounds of duties in others: i.e. unless we respect the duties and the human rights of other people, then we cannot expect other people to respect ours. There is a fundamental misunderstanding sometimes about the ECHR and the trafficking directive that, somehow, it is all about imposing obligations on other people. In fact, it is a very victim-centred approach.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q64 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Lord Bishop of </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Derby</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Would you say that there are gaps or that things just need spelling out more clearly?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Matthew Evans</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: Well, I am aware that a number of people in this room have contributed to the review that took place prior to this. From our point of view, we would want to see more of those recommendations find themselves within the Modern Slavery Bill.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">I will pick up on a couple of points, and then perhaps Saadiya could answer in more detail. There are a couple of issues. For instance, article 15 of the convention requires legal advice and assistance. There is a fundamental tension between that and schedule 1, paragraph 32, of the LASPO Act, which reduces the right of trafficking victims to gain legal advice and assistance, reduces judicial review in particular cases and reduces legal advice only to people who have had a positive resolution in relation to the trafficking convention.</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">There are also tensions in relation to the risk assessment periods, for example, which are required by article 16. There are various recommendations in relation to the UN convention on drug use, which sets out what a risk assessment should undertake.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">There are tensions in relation to secure and stable accommodation. For instance, the directive of 2011 says that it has to be gender specific. There is nothing within the Modern Slavery Bill that highlights that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">On the recovery period as set out, the </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> meets its obligations in relation to 45 days, above the 30 days required by the directive, but the expert committee in relation to trafficking recommended 90 days—three </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">months.

What sort of changes would you like to see in the NRM system? Does the NRM need to be put on some form of statutory basis? How detailed would you imagine that statutory basis to be?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Saadiya Chaudary</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: Our starting position would be that we do think the NRM needs a statutory basis. As it is presently constructed, we feel the division between the UK Visa and Immigration and the UK Human Trafficking Centre is problematic. We do think there is a conflict between the policies that drive UK Visa and Immigration and the purposes of the National Referral Mechanism, which is to identify and provide support and protection to victims of trafficking. For that reason, we would encourage the immigration authorities to be removed from decision making when it comes to recognising victims of trafficking. We would say that, where there are related immigration issues, the first and foremost consideration would be the status of the victim as a trafficking victim or not, and the immigration issues would be assessed separately from that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">In terms of what the legislation should perhaps look like, we think it should set out the formal role and powers of the National Referral Mechanism. We think it is essential that there should be some form of formal review or appeals procedure against a negative reasonable grounds decision. There should be the possibility of public funding made available for victims to be able to pursue these reviews and appeals.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">There should also be set out within the legislation, as far as possible, a procedure by which the National Referral Mechanism operates in terms of maybe time periods or the kind of support provided to individuals within those time periods at the reasonable ground stage and perhaps at conclusive ground stage as well.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Matthew Evans</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: That tension can be seen in the percentage of decisions upheld when you compare the Home Office versus the UKHTC. The UKHTC obviously deals with EU and </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> victims of trafficking. It has a nearly 80% upholding of somebody being identified as a potential victim of trafficking. That drops right the way down to 20% when the Home Office is involved. We are not the first people to raise the issue about the Home Office being in quite an invidious position regarding targets and the general atmosphere especially in relation to third-country nationals. How much that affects their decision </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">making is something that a number of research papers have picked up on.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q66 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lord Warner:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Do you see this as stuff that should be in primary legislation or more as issues that should be dealt with in more detail in secondary legislation?

We would also want within primary legislation, although that would obviously be teased out in relation to guidance, a much more victim-centred approach in relation to transposing at least the minimum standards that are within the directive and the convention.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q67 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir John Randall:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Your organisation provides training to agencies.

We take a slightly different view from the Children’s Commissioner in that we would like to see it premised upon the same basis as the Children’s Commissioner in terms of it being independent from the Home Office—a separate legal entity. I appreciate the issues raised by the Children’s Commissioner regarding a memorandum of understanding and making sure that toes are not stepped on, but they would not be the first two such Commissioners who have had overlapping work and have managed to work together. We think it is essential that it reports to Parliament and not to the Home Office, and that it has a data collection and analysis mandate as well. That is something which, for instance, the UKHTC does not have as a statutory footing.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q73 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mrs Spelman:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> The Children’s Commissioner comes under the wing of the Department for Education.

Article 19 goes further than that and also provides that they should have close co-operation with civil society organisations. That also suggests an overview of protection of victims, which is why we are not quite sure where the Commissioner should sit, because that could include education or health services as well and an overview of those support mechanisms provided to victims. We do think that an overview of that should also come within the Commissioner’s role.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q76 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> When you talk about the protection of victims, can you just give us some more information on that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Saadiya Chaudary</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: This is from articles 10 to 16 of the trafficking convention. On identification, victims are entitled to minimum support mechanisms, including financial support and assistance, psychological </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">recovery, and assistance to adequate health services. If it is a child victim, there should be access to education. In addition to that, there is the right to compensation and protection from criminalisation.

That would be in terms of the investigation and prosecution, where victims are coming from, how many are now being supported, how many are identified, and how many are being dealt with by various authorities, in what way and what the outcomes are.

Eurostat has been quite clear about the fact that, often, with regard to information around trafficking there is incomplete information. The whole idea about what the Modern Slavery Bill might achieve, and one of the things in relation to making the UK a leader in relation to combating anti-trafficking, is to give the Anti-Slavery Commissioner enough powers, and for the public authorities and various parts of civil society to have sufficient information and knowledge, to be able to impart that information. They need to know what the Anti-Slavery Commissioner is looking for, to be clear about their statutory duty to provide that information and for the Anti-Slavery Commissioner to have an independent and robust ability to be able to report on their findings. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">If one wants to be a leader in relation to anti-trafficking, then the provision of that information is fundamental.
