Further changes to State Earnings Related Pensions (SERPS) in 2016 will also be significant. Councils are working closely with providers but supporting them through fee increases is becoming harder. The average increase is 1.5 per cent, which is below the rate of inflation. This is set against national policy pressures to ensure market stability and quality as part of improving outcomes for individuals.</span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">5.6</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The Government’s far-reaching welfare reforms are likely to increase demand for care and support services and impact further on the ability to raise income.

Reducing spending on prevention and early intervention is one of the only places left to look for further savings; but doing so runs counter to the policy direction set out in the care and support White Paper.</span></p><p style="line-height:13pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="6" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The impact on NHS plans of decisions currently being made by local authorities and the use of the additional funding for social care being made available through the NHS budget</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">6.1</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The NHS Transfer announced in 2010 has made a difference to councils.
