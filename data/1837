He made this remark aware that economic growth in Northern Ireland will be heavily dependent on a workforce with knowledge of telecommunications, ICT, agrifood, advanced materials, advanced engineering and life and health sciences. Yet, although women account for 59% of all students enrolled in Northern Ireland’s universities, they comprise only 19% of first degree graduates in engineering and technology, and 26% in computing science.</span><a name="_ftnref1"></a><a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Employers in the STEM sector in Northern Ireland are already experiencing difficulty in recruiting and retaining suitably skilled staff.

While in general women have been catching up with men at this level of education, the figures hide a predictable gender imbalance:  women comprise 22% of engineering, manufacturing and construction PhD graduates (EU-27, 26%, QUB 36%) and 38% of science, mathematics and computing PhD graduates (EU-27, 40%, QUB 54%).

It is also embedded in the way people think and act. Over the last decade, in Queen’s we have introduced policies, changed practices, and challenged unconsciously-held views on women’s academic contributions.  This has led to women having greater visibility across the university in many and varied roles, including leadership roles; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">inviting leading women in science to give annual lectures and keynote addresses; partnering with external institutions at local, national and international level to bring role model women into the University; having an active commissioning programme for portraits of important University women. In addition, regular networking opportunities for mid-level and senior women provide opportunities for sharing experiences and providing mutual support and friendship across disciplinary and managerial lines. Ensuring gender balance among invited speakers is given importance at all levels, as is actively seeking suitably qualified women for membership of international and external advisory panels. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="7" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 13.25pt; padding-left:8.05pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Importantly, too, senior men in the University have made vital contributions to this cultural change. The Vice-Chancellor has consistently and unconditionally championed gender equality in all aspects of University life, thereby conveying the importance of supporting the careers of women in STEM, and has led by example in enabling job-sharing by the staff in his office. Senior men in academic-related management positions have supported, resourced, and engaged with equality-promoting activities, including making additional financial resources available to support School Athena SWAN submissions, and attending to gender balance in the composition of the University’s governing body, Senate. Addressing the gender balance of honorary graduands is now routine, as is ensuring that University delegations meeting policy-makers are composed of a balance of women and men. Pro-Vice Chancellors (two male, one female) actively integrate a gender-aware perspective into the policy and operational aspects of their briefs. In the STEM faculties, the Deans have incorporated reporting on gender equality by means of Athena SWAN into the annual aims and objectives of all Heads of School, and are in turn expected to integrate gender equality (via SWAN) into their own annual appraisal plans. The Dean of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, too, is leading the adoption of a SWAN agenda in the non-STEM disciplines. The above measures are not ‘box-ticking’ exercises. Instead, they demand conversations and actions from senior staff in positions of considerable authority on a regular basis.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="8" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 13.25pt; padding-left:8.05pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The process is also a ‘bottom-up’ one, whereby women in Schools feel involved and have ownership of the gender agenda along with senior men. To facilitate this ownership, each School has two SWAN Champions linked into a University-wide SWAN Champions’ Network where learning and practice is shared, and issues for attention are  raised. This network provides a supportive environment for initiatives led by the women and men in Schools, and complements senior policy-making. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="9" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 13.25pt; padding-left:8.05pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">An essential component of this institutional gender equality architecture is the Queen’s Gender Initiative. Led by a senior female academic, the office has provided leadership on gender equality issues for over a decade. QGI is resourced and funded by the University, and develops specific supportive mechanisms to enhance opportunities for all women across the University. It works closely with the Equal Opportunities Unit in providing a focal point of gender equality expertise for Schools, SWAN Champions, and the University. It has effectively promoted the message of gender equality at a policy level, assisted by having as chairperson a senior lay woman from the University’s Senate, providing an important link for QGI into the leading governance body of the University.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="10" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18.75pt; padding-left:2.55pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">An important element in changing the organisational culture to become more woman-friendly is ensuring that women are represented fairly in positions of leadership across the University and on University Committees. This has brought the number of women heading Schools from 1 in 2008 to 5 in 2013. 25% of all Heads of School positions are now held by women, including in Biological Sciences, Law, and Psychology as well as in Nursing and Midwifery, and Modern Languages. The Deans, with Committee membership nominating powers, have an important role to play in this regard. They actively seek names of suitable women and men to fill committee vacancies, and take the gender balance of the Committee into account when making their decision. The University’s </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Leadership Excellence</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> programme, run in association with the Leadership Institute, prepares the next generation of academics for University leadership.

These mainly occur in the transition from Lecturer to Senior Lecturer/Reader. We have found that a critical issue at this career stage for women is finding the best way of balancing home and work commitments. Among the policies and practices we have introduced to support women at this career point include:  a maternity cover scheme to enable women take their maternity leave without worry about replacement costs; a ‘research only’ semester for women scientists returning from maternity leave; enabling women to return from maternity leave on a part-time basis while guaranteeing that they can return to full-time work when they wish; a summer holiday scheme and after-school club for children of academic staff; on-campus comprehensive full-time childcare provision; flexible working practices that are taken into account in a positive manner in the promotion application process. The role as SWAN Champion, often taken by early career women, is also considered a formal aspect of career development, and time spent on this administrative activity is taken into account in School work-load allocation models.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="13" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18.75pt; padding-left:2.55pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Promotions</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">We know from speaking with women in our institution that they are less likely to put themselves forward for promotion if they do not understand the criteria and the process.  From an early point in tackling gender imbalance in the institution, it was clear that promotion procedures needed to be made more transparent. An early, and continuing, initiative is the annual ‘promotions seminar’ at which academic and professional leaders responsible for the process demystify the promotions criteria and procedure. This is held at a point in the university cycle when academics have time to prepare their applications, four months before the formal promotion application call is made. Along with this annual seminar, the long-running and award-winning mentoring scheme plays an important part in encouraging women to apply, and in assisting women with their submissions. Many schools now proactively identify candidates for promotion rather than waiting for people to self-select. Furthermore, service as a SWAN Champion is recognised as demonstrating leadership in the promotions criteria. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Over time, we have found that women’s chances of being successfully promoted match, and even outweigh, those of men.  Of the 181 women mentored since 2000, 51% have secured promotion, some on more than one occasion. Our continuing challenge is to encourage women to apply for promotion, as they still do so at a lesser rate than men. The close monitoring of the gendered patterns of promotions is undertaken by the Equal Opportunities Unit, working in tandem with Queen’s Gender Initiative, and overseen by the Standing Committee of Senate. The strength of the promotions-supporting actions derive from this vital evidence base, as do many of the other initiatives undertaken by the University to support women’s career progression in academia.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="14" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18.75pt; padding-left:2.55pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Work-Life Balance</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">We have found that one of the most common points at which women abandon an academic career is at the level of post-doctoral researcher. This career stage often coincides with the time in women’s lives when pregnancy and childcare demands are at their most acute, and/or older family members, including parents, require care and support. As women in Northern Ireland (as elsewhere) still take responsibility for the majority of childcare and domestic work, Queen’s is conscious of the need to provide flexible working opportunities to enable women advance their careers in a similar manner to men. There are a range of initiatives across the 20 Schools in the University, and institutional policies in place, to facilitate flexible working so as to reconcile work and family life. Among these are: recognition in the promotion documentation that flexible working does not militate against promotion; holding key School meetings during core hours and scheduled well in advance; allowing women researchers going on maternity leave to place their research grants in abeyance, and the institution shouldering the cost of replacement researchers for the duration of the maternity leave.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="15" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18.75pt; padding-left:2.55pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Gender and Leadership in Science and Society</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">These are some examples of the initiatives Queen’s University has taken in order to attract and retain talented women academics. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">We know that one measure, or one method, does not bring success in this regard.

Through leading by example, the University promotes a wider cultural acceptance of gender equality. Under the framework of Gender and Leadership in Science and Society (GLiSS), the University works closely with other leading employers (such as the Police Service of NI, Belfast City Council, and the STEM Business Subgroup) and the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland to support women’s career success as well as recruit and retain women in science-based employment.</span><a name="_ftnref7"></a><a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="18" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18.75pt; padding-left:2.55pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Although the Queen’s initiatives in fostering a gender equal culture have been ongoing since 2000, intensive participation in the Athena SWAN programme since its inception in 2006 has consolidated these endeavours and mainstreamed an awareness and practice of equality at School level. Athena SWAN is an appropriately demanding process that calls for an intensive scrutiny of gendered career patterns from which specific and targeted actions are developed to address the issues uncovered by data analysis. Queen’s was the first HEI to win a Silver institutional award in 2006, and again in 2011.

Through the SWAN-required Self Assessment Teams, these early career female voices are heard by senior academics who – in the absence of a SWAN-type process – are not always aware of the local problems and pressures that young female staff face. Indeed, the opportunity for input given to the voice and interests of early career women in their own School decision-making process, and the legitimation of this voice through SWAN, is a critical aspect of supporting and retaining women in STEM careers. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="20" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18.75pt; padding-left:2.55pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Our actions in Queen’s, and Universities’ actions more generally, are influenced and regulated by governments and research funders. Research councils and funding bodies such as the Wellcome Trust, the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering offer prestigious fellowships lasting five or more years which, particularly in science, are often essential to covert a postdoctoral position (or a series of postdoctoral positions) into an academic post. It is important that such bodies are sensitive to the types of application made by women and are able to make adjustments for issues such as career breaks, flexible or part-time working, not only during the fellowship (as many such schemes do), but also at the point of application. A clear focus on quality of outputs, rather than quantity, would help. Fellowship committees can be influenced significantly by the number of first author papers and citation counts in determining the allocation of fellowships, and these criteria can work against female applicants.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:6pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:6pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">What role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="21" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18.75pt; padding-left:2.55pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Government, then, has an important role to play in encouraging the retention of women in academic scientific careers.

Specifically, Funding Councils could be incentivised to develop Intermediate Research Fellowships to support women to consolidate their research profiles having had one or more periods of maternity leave. There is a gap in the funding available for New Investigators and Senior Investigators which affects both female and male academic scientists. However, the impact is greater for female research-active academics who have had to take leave at this crucial juncture and who are therefore disadvantaged in their CV and publications record. A prompt on the application form specifically encouraging candidates to identify periods of maternity/paternity leave or periods of part-time working for family reasons would be helpful in explaining gaps and apparent fall-off in productivity, and would send a strong message of recognition of such circumstances.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 49.65pt;
