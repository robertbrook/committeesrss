font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">GLEAM has received extensive evidence from all parts of the country of the damage done by recreational vehicles on ways that were never intended for such use, and will supply examples of such evidence to the Committee separately.  We are aware that the Peak District has probably the worst problem in the country in this respect and that PDGLA is providing its own evidence.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="color:#0d0d0d;

font-size:12pt">GLEAM draws attention to the fact that there is no right of appeal against inaction or unreasonable refusal by highway authorities in respect of requests for Traffic Regulation Orders (TROs) under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 (RTRA).  This is inconsistent with there being rights of appeal in virtually every other field of rights of way management including public path orders, obstruction and repair notices, and even rights of way determinations.  GLEAM proposes that there should be an amendment to the RTRA introducing similar rights.  This would conveniently dovetail with Clauses 15 - 17 of the Draft Bill which seek to amend the Highways Act 1980 as to applications for public path orders.  </span><br /><span style="color:#0d0d0d;

font-size:12pt">Section 130 of the Highways Act reads: </span><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">"(1) It is the duty of the highway authority to assert and protect the rights of the public to the use and enjoyment of any highway for which they are the highway authority, including any roadside waste which forms part of it."  </span><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">That is frequently interpreted as asserting the rights of all users, even though the use by a small minority may result in damage which prevents the use and enjoyment by the majority. GLEAM has received countless complaints about green lanes being damaged by motor vehicles, to the extent of making walking or cycling impossible, and of rutting which presents a risk putting use by horses out of the question.  Occasions of actual injury have been reported, as have cases of horses being 'spooked' by fast-moving motor vehicles - even to the point of causing fatal injuries to riders.  </span><br /><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></li><li style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Highway authorities have a parallel duty not only to repair rights of way, but also to spend taxpayers' money in a responsible way. A </span><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal">badly-damaged BOAT or UCR can cost up to £75,000 per mile to repair</span><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">. Damage to public paths is not only a criminal offence in itself (a factor normally overlooked by highway authorities) but is also one of the express grounds for imposing a TRO.  Regrettably, authorities commonly adopt a policy of waiting for damage to occur before even considering making a TRO.  It is factors such as these which offer such a compelling case for a right of appeal.  </span><br /><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></li><li style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Failure by an authority to carry out its repair obligations is covered by Sections 56 - 58 of the Act.  There are appeal rights to the magistrates' court, including the matter of costs.</span><br /><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></li><li style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Damage which impairs the use and enjoyment of highways by others is in effect an obstruction.  Sections 130A-D of the Act deal with notices under this heading and also with appeal to the magistrates' court, including the matter of costs. There is no apparent reason why no right of appeal exists in respect of TROs.  Rectifying this defect would fit squarely within the proposals under Clauses 15 - 17 of the Deregulation Bill.  Drafting such a measure would be straightforward, as use could be made of the existing legislation referred to above </span><br /><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 17pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="11" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">On balance the proposal will reduce bureaucracy for the same reason as is given in paragraph 81 of the Notes to the Bill. This states regarding applications for gating orders: </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">"This measure will make it easier for owners to obtain permission to erect gates on byways. It is thought that it will also have the effect of reducing the number of occasions on which applications for an order modifying a definitive map and statement to show a byway are opposed by landowners."</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">  It is the experience of GLEAM that in a large number of cases objections to modification orders are accompanied by complaints at the lack of TROs, or requests for the making of TROs, as part of the objections and submissions. Doubtless the Planning Inspectorate will be able to confirm this important point.</span><br /><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></li><li style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">GLEAM particularly wishes to support PDGLA in its battle against off-roading in the Peak District.  Improvements to the TRO system would offer a major step in that direction.</span><br /><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Government policy</span><br /><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="13" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">In December 2003, the then Minister for Rural Affairs (Alun Michael) said: </span><br /><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">As Rural Affairs Minister, I have been approached by many individuals and organisations who are deeply concerned about problems caused by the use of mechanically propelled vehicles on rights of way and in the wider countryside. I share these concerns, having seen for myself examples of damage to fragile tracks and other aspects of our natural and cultural heritage in various areas of the country. There is considerable concern about behaviour that causes distress to others seeking quiet enjoyment of the countryside ....</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">I do not think that it makes sense that historic evidence of use by horse drawn vehicles or dedications for vehicular use at a time before the internal combustion engine existed can give rise to rights to use modern mechanically propelled vehicles. Those who suffer from vehicle misuse find this incomprehensible and in this paper we offer new proposals that are intended to address what many have come to view as the inappropriate and unsustainable way in which vehicular rights are acquired and claimed on rights of way."</span><br /><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></li><li style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">That statement of policy was the introduction to what became the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006.  Giving a right of appeal to citizens on TROs is entirely in accord with the Government's policy as to the countryside, as well as with its policy on localism.  By bringing focus to authorities' implementation of TRO law, there would probably be a nil net effect in the regulation balance.  Undoubtedly it would lead to substantial savings in public expenditure, given that the cost of applying a TRO is very substantially less than the cost of repair brought about by the failure to take effective measures to prevent damage.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 17pt"><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="15" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">For these reasons GLEAM urges the Government to use the Deregulation Bill to introduce the right of appeal into TRO legislation to protect unsealed BOATs and UUCRs from further damage by recreational off-road motor vehicles.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 17pt"><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">2</span><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">0</span><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> August 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:center"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">3</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
