However, what has been lost by depending on leader-to-leader engagement has been a deeper strategic understanding between the two sides which would lead to more opportunities for collaboration and help avoid potential pitfalls where interests diverge.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="2" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">The Coalition government appeared to recognize this inadequacy and tried to address it with the announcement, in May 2011, during President Obama’s visit to London, of a Joint Strategy Board that would facilitate regular interaction between the two National Security </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">Advisors. Unfortunately, according to senior officials on both sides (privately) this initiative has largely failed in its objective.

The benefits of the close working relationship between the two militaries have played out more recently in Libya, as seen in the speed with which the UK was able to bring the US to support NATO operations there despite its concerns.  While at a senior level, relations are extremely close, on the ground there do appear to be some challenges, particularly with regards to a lack of understanding on the part of the US military over different British Rules of Engagement and capabilities. This has, occasionally, tarnished the otherwise great respect in which the two forces hold one another.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="5" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">While the ‘essential’ or ‘special’ relationship is not questioned in the US, this is not the case in the UK where constant debate takes place over whether this remains true and its implications. In the early days of the Coalition the public rhetoric suggested a more independent Britain that was able to stand alone rather than either with the US or EU.  This perception has changed, particularly in light of the debate about UK membership of the EU where, rhetorically at least, some in the UK have suggested that leaving the EU would result in a closer relationship with the US.  From the US perspective however, as Philip Gordon, then-Assistant Secretary of State for Europe stated candidly, this scenario is of significant concern to US policy-makers who strongly value the UK presence in the EU. While it would be overstating the fact to suggest that this development (were a referendum to be successful in 2017) would have a significant impact on the UK-US relationship over the immediate term, the longer-term effect could be more concrete.   </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="6" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">Finally, some reference should be made to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), which is likely to be the most significant initiative the US engages with Europe on (including the UK) in the coming years.  TTIP is a priority of both the US and UK, and the US would like to see a strong UK negotiator driving the agenda for the EU.  Thus the current British wariness of the latter causes some regrets.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">What is the relationship between the UK Government’s policy towards the US and its increased focus on UK relationships outside the Transatlantic area?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="7" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">As noted above, the UK-US relationship lacks a robust strategic perspective in lieu of focusing on the more urgent items (such as the </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">Eurocrisis</span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">, Egypt and Syria policy).

This holds true even, or perhaps especially, where the capabilities the two nations bring to the table are different. It is in these situations in particular where there is great potential to realize greater benefits through collaboration.  Where the interests aren’t so closely aligned, there is also the chance, at a minimum, to ensure that the two states’ actions don’t undermine one another and that both are prepared for predictable policy disparities (such as in the Middle East Peace Process). There is no reason why an independent UK foreign policy beyond the transatlantic cannot still be an avenue for benefit to the transatlantic relationship (and vice versa).  Again, in large part due to the lack of strategic engagement, this is not taking place except in an ad hoc manner.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">How is the UK Government responding, and how should it respond, to the US ‘pivot to Asia’?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="11" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">The US pivot to Asia, while the right policy, was badly implemented (as many in the US administration will agree).  It has led to much confusion both in the region as well as, in particular, in Europe.  The intention – to reassure America’s Asian allies and partners that the US was going to maintain its presence and focus there – has largely been unsuccessful as </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">those in the region have suggested a ‘pivot towards’ could be followed by a ‘pivot away’.  Subsequent rhetoric by senior US policy-makers such as that regarding the Scarborough Shoals in 2012 and the </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">Senkaku</span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt"> Islands in 2013 has not reassured.  Meanwhile, China has reacted badly to what it perceives as a more assertive America in its region.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="12" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">While the policy has also led many in Europe to question whether it will mean a ‘pivot away’ from their region, </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">the consequences for European security of the pivot and the force downsizing should not be exaggerated.

The direction of China’s development and its internal stability has consequences globally and it is a necessary partner for a broad range of initiatives from the environment to North Korea and Syria policy. Supporting India’s economic growth (and reform) to ensure the growth and engagement of another large democratic power is a high priority, as is the reversal of North Korea’s nuclear program. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="15" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">Over the past approximately two years, the UK government has promoted an increasingly more nuanced strategic vision for Asia rather than the more limited scope commercial objectives.  This policy is one that should be supported.  Closer engagement with the US on this initiative would further both nations’ goals in the region.  At the same time, the FCO should continue to bring other European member states on board (the French and Italians are slowly heading in this direction).  Collaborating together on a joint policy to approach the major challenges and opportunities in Asia, particularly with respect to countries such as China, India and Burma, is far more likely to have impact than working individually. And, while it is true that the UK (and Europe) do not have sufficient military assets to be a significant power in the region, engagement in Asia is far more than just security-related.
