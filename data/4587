We are trying to encourage them to be much more heat aware and much more thoughtful about how they heat their home and, most importantly, how they insulate their home, and about the very substantial savings there are to be had from comprehensive insulation and energy saving. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q151</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We have some evidence that although low-carbon heating systems work well in practice, a lot of consumers are used to switching something on and expecting it to get warm </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">straight away.

I think you are probably talking about heat pumps in particular. Obviously they require a different type of use from when you have a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">combi</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> boiler that you can rustle up at a moment’s notice. But, increasingly, the evidence is that people do get used to them. There was some disconcerting Energy Saving Trust research a couple of years back, but since then we have had a larger roll-out of ground source heat pumps in particular, supported by our precursor to the domestic RHI, the Renewable Heat Premium Payment programme. The feedback we have had, primarily from social housing that has installed these systems at scale, is, broadly speaking, very positive. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Perhaps, Mr Yeo, I may ask my team to introduce themselves?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Stephen Martin:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I am Stephen Martin.

One is to educate the installers, because all the evidence is that installers are incredibly important, not only in putting in the system, but in explaining how to use it. We have put some money into apprenticeships and training so that installers who are currently expert only in gas appliances will also be able to install low-carbon heating appliances. We have had very good take-up of that in the couple of months since it has been up and running, and that is being timed specifically to go with the launch of the domestic RHI. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The other thing is the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">M</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">icrogeneration</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Certification S</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">cheme standards, which we have improved as a result of the field trials to which the Minister referred.

It is a bit tricky, because obviously the focus of the regular statistical releases is on the number of finance plans that have been lodged, which is still relatively low. However, just looking at finance packages alone gives a very disproportionate view of the success of the Green Deal. We now have had more than 120,000 assessments and our latest polling evidence shows that more than 80% of the people and households that have had a Green Deal assessment have been moved to install measures already, are taking steps to install measures, or are looking to install measures. The figure of 80% is pretty impressive. What we do know, however, is that the first wave of 120,000—the early adopters; the more enthusiastic; the pioneers— are, perhaps unsurprisingly, more pre-disposed to see the value in what they are installing. Also, I think people underestimate just how personal and compelling a Green Deal assessment is. This is not something that plops through the letterbox; you actually sit down and discuss it at your kitchen table with a professional installer who runs through a checklist. People have a bespoke, personal explanation and can ask questions. That means that people are installing these measures. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The problem that we have, which your other witness raised, is that if people say, “Actually, I do not want to share the savings with a finance company. I do not want to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">wait until I have paid off the loan to get the full benefit. I want to do all these things now,” they are not obliged to register them in the same way as if a finance plan is lodged with the Green Deal finance company. They are not even obliged to install Green Deal measures with a Green Deal installer—they could use their own tradesmen.

It seems a pity to go to all the trouble of reducing the carbon emissions of a property and then not to put proper controls on the heating. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gregory Barker:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It is important to understand what the Green Deal is: it is basically a market framework.

The great thing is that there have been significant step changes in heating control technology, which in the past has not been at all user-friendly.

There are new products coming to the market, not least driven by the creation of that market by the Green Deal, that are a lot more user-friendly. This works well, and it also works well with the roll-out of smart meters. It is going to be consumer-led, rather than Government-led, but certainly every Green Deal assessment runs through a checklist of, I think, 46 measures that are eligible for Green Deal. I expect that list to grow when we publish the next approved list of measures.

That is often the thing that first triggers their interest. We have seen that with the phenomenal proliferation of solar panels. There are now about 1.2 million people who have solar panels on their roofs at home. There have been just over half a million installations over the last three years. It is a very popular technology. The prices have come down substantially. Three years ago, a typical set of solar panels for a 4 kW system typically cost more than £15,000; you can now get them in some cases for under £5,000. So not only has the cost to the consumer of supporting these technologies come down, but it’s a lot more democratic because, for a lot of families, finding the finance to put £5,000 into a system is a lot easier than finding £15,000.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Stephen Martin:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I might just add that as well as Green Deal assessors responding to the opportunity of the domestic RHI in the way the Minister has described, we expect that some renewable heat installers will become Green Deal assessors as a result of the introduction of the domestic RHI, so that they can offer the whole package, the end-to-end package. Certainly, anecdotal feedback that we have had from the industry, which clearly is gearing up now for the introduction of the domestic RHI, suggests that that is what they are thinking about.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gregory Barker:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We deliberately improved the—when I reformed the feed-in tariff system to bring down the subsidy, I also put in place an energy efficiency requirement, because it obviously makes no sense to subsidise people to produce renewable electricity or heat in an inefficient home.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q161</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir Robert Smith:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What fiscal measures do the Government have, and are they considering, to encourage energy efficiency in the home?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gregory Barker:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The most recent measures are those announced as part of the autumn statement package.

That is particularly pertinent because we know that when people move, it’s the time when they are most likely to consider many of the larger measures, because that is when they will be decorating—they might be taking up carpets and moving furniture; they might be doing all sorts of things—so there is a degree of disruption anyway.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q162</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir Robert Smith:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Is that stamp duty rebate on an energy efficiency achievement, or does it require you to do a Green Deal?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gregory Barker:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We haven’t yet announced the details.

For example, in the same package, we announced a quadrupling of our Green Deal communities scheme, which is supporting local authorities with cash to fund a roll-out of street-by-street installations. We know that the most effective way of delivering energy efficiency and of creating interest in and enthusiasm for the larger, whole-house makeovers is by doing it on a street-by-street, community basis, so we are now putting £80 million into funding those programmes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q163</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir Robert Smith:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Is there any incentive for landlords?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gregory Barker:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes.

Certainly in my constituency a lot of people live in stone-built houses, which are off the gas grid, so they have a double incentive to try to do something, but the costs and the disruption of solid-wall insulation are still a real challenge.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gregory Barker:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Well, I think the honest answer is we have a big challenge on solid wall. We have to drive down the cost. If we are going to roll out solid wall at scale, which we need to, we have got to work with the industry to deliver it much more cost-effectively. It is still pretty expensive to install solid wall on a typical property, which is why most solid wall will require some form of subsidy, usually from the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">ECO</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> scheme. So </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">we have got to work on driving down the cost. As the market scales up, we think there are opportunities for industry to bring their prices down.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The other thing we have to do is improve the quality of solid-wall products. It is good to see that there have been some very exciting innovations in the way that solid wall is delivered now, for both internal and external applications. The days when solid-wall insulation basically used to mean smothering any form of character or differentiation on a property, so it just looked like a sort of Lego house, are gone. You can actually get some very attractive products that look like brick, or respect local vernacular. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Likewise, internal solid-wall insulation, which can be sometimes more problematic because of the disruption it causes to the home, or the loss of space in the room, is getting much thinner, and easier and less disruptive to install; but there is still progress that we need to make, to make it more attractive to consumers to install this, because as you rightly identify there is a high number of properties where really only solid-wall insulation is going to make a big difference to their energy consumption.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q165</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">John Robertson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Minister, I have to say I have quite a number of solid-wall insulations in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Glasgow</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">; they are usually multi-storey buildings, and they are a real problem.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Moving on to building regulations, according to our witnesses, the Government has pulled back from zero-carbon homes.

They are supported by ECO, but that is a finite sum and obviously it is funded by consumer bills. There is a limit to how far we can roll this out. The most important thing is that we continue to drive down the cost and focus on those properties where there will be the greatest benefit, particularly for the fuel-poor.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q184</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir Robert Smith:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Again, that can be solid rural properties.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gregory Barker:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Absolutely, yes. The design of ECO is unlike that of the previous energy obligation, where there tended to be a strange delivery pattern. There was insufficient delivery in inner cities—particularly London—because of the perceived high cost of installations in inner cities, which was associated with parking and the higher cost of doing business. Yet equally, there was very poor distribution of these subsidised measures to rural communities, because they are harder to reach. I personally insisted that we ring-fenced part of the ECO funding to make sure that rural communities got their fair share of access to it.

It is also important to emphasise that under our approach to the domestic RHI, which will replace the RHPP in the spring, we have built in a number of incentives and standards to ensure that installers and householders are incentivised to put in efficient systems.   That is all part of the strategy to see heat pump performance improve further and steadily over time. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gregory Barker:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It might smack of change and progress, but we are not expecting people to switch in a manner that compromises either convenience or comfort.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">188</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley: </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I declare an interest in that I depend on propane gas at the moment, and I would quite like a heat pump, if it would work.  I notice that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Calor</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Gas, which might be in a Mandy Rice-Davies situation, says “Many heat pumps, when installed, do not do what they say on the tin, and no amount of taxpayer’s subsidy can draw a veil over that.  Air Source Heat Pumps emerge from independent testing as a bust technology undeserving of taxpayer support.”  Do you share—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gregory Barker:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I probably would not go to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Calor</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Gas for the most impartial—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I acknowledge that, but—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gregory Barker:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It is by no means perfect, and the reason we are deploying heat pumps as we are is to learn from that deployment.

There has been a significant and important debate about the extent to which heating will fundamentally electrify in the decades out to 2050. I think that both the Government and the Committee on Climate Change had a starting position based on some fairly simplistic modelling, which showed that the most cost-effective way to decarbonise heating would probably be largely to electrify it. That works until you put in the very granular modelling that actually looks at hours and days throughout the whole year of heat demand, which fluctuates very significantly across the seasons. When we re-ran some modelling—with the help of a number of different external bodies—with hour-to-hour heat demand, it showed that because heat demand peaks so heavily in the coldest days of the winter, you end up with an enormous drain on the electricity grid if you have electrified all your heating demand. Clearly, the more you can do with insulation and storage, the better. None the less, the more refined modelling shows that there might well be a case for keeping forms of gas heating as a back-up or alternative for perhaps longer than both we and the Committee on Climate Change originally assumed. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">This also plays into the conversation about heat networks. We as a Department have said that we think heat networks have been under-exploited and their potential has not been fully recognised. I think the Committee on Climate Change agreed with us on that point, although obviously you could ask them directly. One of the reasons why their estimates of the number of heat pumps in the 2020s has gone down is that their estimates of the amount of heat networks distributing will have gone up. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q194</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Graham Stringer:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So they are following you rather than you following them? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">David </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Wagstaff</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think we follow each other. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q195</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Graham Stringer:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It was a rhetorical point, really.

However we meet our heat demand in this country, it is large. If you include all heat—industrial, commercial and domestic heat—some 45% of our total energy demand is just on heating, so there is always going to be an enormous call on some form of energy to meet that demand.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q205</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> And a move from oil to heat pumps will exacerbate the difficulties in terms of peak demand for the electricity network.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">David </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Wagstaff</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Clearly it is going from burning oil to using electricity. That is also true—sorry, just to go slightly outside the remit of this hearing—of the transport solution, if you are going down the electric transport route. The whole system needs to be looked at. I know that other witnesses have referred to the importance of the whole system analysis, but if you are looking decades ahead, you need to think about the way that the grids interact and the different demands.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q206</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> That is true, but in transport it is much easier to spread the load through different times of the day and night.

It is a very complicated bit of modelling to try to work out these different interventions. You have, of course, national and local infrastructure and, in any case, you are having to upgrade. For example, there is a gas grid upgrade going on at the moment, which is primarily for health and safety reasons, but you need to factor in all the things </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">that will have to happen anyway—reinforcing electricity substations, distribution networks and so on.

But where there is density of heat demand, which effectively will mean in urban areas, often a mixed demand, partly to get away with the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">peakiness</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> problem of seasonable demand, what you ideally want to make a heat network profitable is a fairly steady demand across the year. That means you are probably looking for things such as hospitals, leisure centres, swimming pools or prisons. There is a number of large buildings that you can put on a heat network alongside domestic buildings, offices and so on. These things do exist, this is not theoretical.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">You obviously need a heat supply, typically provided by an energy centre, which might have an energy-from-waste element, bio or gas CHP and, increasingly in places such as Denmark, it will also have cheap electricity that can be taken off the grid when the wind is blowing and the demand for electricity is relatively low. You can take that electricity at a very cheap price and heat up water in large thermal stores on the network.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That is the vision of how an urban heat network can operate and we do it.

One of the things that people had asked us for, in addition to making it a primary measure under ECO, was for certainty going forward to be extended under ECO, which was also done two weeks ago. Those extra two years will also help, because the prime difference between a company choosing to use a heat network to meet its ECO obligation, as opposed to a measure in the building, is that it is a much longer-term, larger project, so having that certainty over time should help.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It is still a consultation. We have still got to consult on the detail. Fundamentally, it will be a choice for the company on whom the obligation falls whether they wish to score using a heat network to address whole streets of houses, effectively at the same time, or whether they want to take measures individually. They will be encouraged to do both, so we would expect them to be taking insulation measures in the homes that they are putting on to the networks.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q218</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Whitehead:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Typically a heat network requires, say, 15 years’ funding, which is much longer than the likely longest contract for the heat supply that there is, whereas what you are talking about is a pretty short-term guarantee that something might happen—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">David </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Wagstaff</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The commercial potential of heat networks is recognised in the market.

We all understand that biomass creates high-quality heat. It is a renewable energy, but supplies are very much limited, so is it wise basically to waste biomass in the RHI or electricity production when it could be better saved for industrial heat?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">David </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Wagstaff</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The Department published its </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">bioenergy</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> strategy a couple of years ago, as I think you will be aware. As with so many things that we have spoken about today, you cannot look at the heat angle without looking at all the other angles as well, so you are quite right to mention bio for power and equally, of course, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">biofuels</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> for transport as well. What the RHI does is, obviously, to incentivise the use of biomaterials in a whole range of commercial and industrial uses. I think I am right in saying that some of the biggest users of bio are those very industrial plants that you suggest we should incentivise. There is some really large bio CHP. I was at the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Markinch</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> plant a few months ago in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Glenrothes</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, which is starting up now. That is burning waste bio. That is not virgin material; it is waste wood, primarily. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I think it is doing exactly what you are saying it should do, but it is not a closed market. There is an international market for bio materials, so it is not necessarily one at the expense of the other. It is possible to burn bio in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Drax</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> power station, as is being done, and in a combined heat and power plant, as is being done, and in the paper industry, for example, and other industries that require high heat, and indeed in commercial and domestic buildings. So all those things are happening at the moment.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Stephen Martin:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I might just add that the RHI will support biomass at a range of different scales. In terms of the amount we expect to spend and the amount of heat that we expect to get from that, the non-domestic RHI will be substantially larger than the domestic RHI. The changes that we announced to the non-domestic RHI two weeks ago included measures that are very deliberately designed to stimulate more large biomass and biomass CHP to rebalance the spread that we are getting. We have been getting a lot of small and medium-sized biomass up until now. So we see those as important uses for biomass incentivised through the RHI and, as I say, we expect to see a lot more going to larger installations, including some that are in the industrial sector.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q262</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Ian </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lavery</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What alternative low-carbon sources of heat does DECC envisage heavy industry using?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">David </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Wagstaff</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> This might be an opportunity to very briefly mention the sector-specific work that we kicked off in the last couple of months. Again, we announced it in the March document. It is where we are working with the eight most heat-intensive sectors of industry. Effectively, to answer your question—this is not a full answer to your question—we will work with each industry in turn. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Clearly, when you look at industrial heat, it matters massively what you are making. That might sound like a rather obvious point, but temperatures and processes are very important and solutions are very different in something as disparate as the food and drink industry, which is one of the eight and where there are hundreds if not thousands of different processes going on around the country, as opposed to oil refining. That is another one of the eight. There are only eight refineries operating, but they use more heat than any of the other sectors because they are so large. So the solutions will be very different depending on the sector. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Clearly, where you are talking about very high heat temperatures, you are not talking about heat pumps, which means you are talking about bio, but you are talking about combustion of something that is not a fossil fuel, which will mean bio, or it could mean electrification, which is an existing technology in some processes involving steel, for example. Perhaps further out into the future, you could be talking about a hydrogen-type solution or a synthetic-gases-type solution. We are not saying that we know the answers yet but that we want to work with the industry. The industry, incidentally, is very keen to work with us. So this is a very good partnership approach. We are sharing the project with BIS as well. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The other thing I should mention in this context is industrial carbon capture and storage, which we do not yet have any demonstration of in this country, but we have jointly funded a techno-economic study into industrial CCS. We appreciate that it is an under-explored area and the industry is very keen to do that as well. Indeed, as part of the City </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Deal process, we have been working with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Tees</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Valley</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, who have an interest because of their chemical plants up there. They are very interested in industrial CCS as well. So this is another example of where lots of things have to be joined up and a lot of collaboration is involved.

One of the first things I did after coming to this job was to dig behind the figures by going to Germany and trying to work out why a country that was able to deploy and pay for the deployment of the largest level of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">renewables</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in Europe was simultaneously able to dramatically increase its share of the world market for manufactured goods. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Germany continues to have a very robust manufacturing sector, while deploying </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">renewables</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and paying for that deployment in a way that, to date, significantly outstrips the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. The reason for that is not because energy prices are generally cheaper for industry and commerce—they are not—but because </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Germany</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> allows very significant exceptions for energy-intensive industries, which are, by and large, the minority of the manufacturing industry. Where there is a very high energy load as an essential part of an industry’s production process, in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Germany</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> they get a very substantial rebate on their energy bills. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">For the German economy, this amounts to about €5 billion per year handed back to that small section of energy-intensive industries as compensation for policy costs. We recognise that, and it is why last year the Chancellor announced an initial sum of £250 million for a compensation scheme. We recognise that that does not go the full distance in terms of compensation, but it is a step in the right direction. Unfortunately, we have to take into account the record deficit and the state of public finances inherited by the coalition.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We are clear that more needs to be done to assist energy-intensive industries. Clearly, there are two drivers. One is the cost of Government policy on energy-intensive industries, and what we need to do to mitigate that. The other is the underlying cost of energy. These are two quite different factors. Consider </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">France</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">America</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. Obviously, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">America</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is benefiting from the fact that it is a closed market for gas—or at least has been to date—and it has enjoyed extraordinarily low gas prices. That has a very beneficial effect on its economy. At the same time, it has also been able to reduce its carbon emissions, by switching quite significantly from coal to gas.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We are very keen to encourage the same gas revolution here that there has been in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">America</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, by the application of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">fracking</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. Tomorrow, we will announce a further iteration in our </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">fracking</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> strategy.

The big transformational changes that have happened to the energy system in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> by and large took place in a pre-privatisation world.

It is without doubt the case that not as much gas will be used, assuming, of course, that that is still natural gas. One possible scenario would be for something else to go through the gas pipes that is not natural gas, and I mentioned hydrogen earlier in passing.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It is also worth noting that a lot of customers on the gas grid are industrial and commercial customers, so even while domestic users may not be burning gas, we haven’t ever said that there would be no gas available for industry. So it is likely that parts of the network will still be in operation. The question then becomes: which parts of the network won’t be in operation and how do you effect that change? That is a very long-term question, and we have not been definitive in our answer to that because we simply do not know. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q272</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Graham Stringer:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> How will you explain to the electorate, Minister, that they can no longer have gas?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gregory Barker:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think you’re pushing quite far into the future.

One of the advantages of having heat networks is that it is easier to decarbonise a grid than an individual installation.

I do not think that the Government have kept quiet about that fact and it is relatively well recognised. What we have been trying to do is work out what the implications of that are for the future of our heating requirements.

There is a very interesting pilot in Shetland, which </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">we referred to in our document, involving </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Dimplex</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and Scottish and Southern Electricity, which involves using storage heaters in exactly that way.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The answer is that storage heaters are already recognised through their SAP score as being more efficient, but storage heating is another of these technologies which, to fully understand its potential, you need to plug into the whole system and work out how that works with the balancing and trading off of heat and electricity demand.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q279</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> One of our witnesses expressed concern that there aren’t, in the whole range of incentives that exists, incentives that encourage the storage of either power or heat.

We recently announced some further funding for storage, recognising that storage has not had the focus of Government attention that it deserves to date and that there is still a lot more work that we need to do to develop it as a cost-effective technology. We recognise that we are going to need to develop that technology and it will be an increasing part of our focus. The latest grants to storage technology research and development reflect its increasing priority in the Department.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q280</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you think it would be helpful if there were a market for energy storage?

Pump storage has been a part of the electricity economy for decades and continues to be so. We certainly want to encourage all these things, if there is going to be a resurgence of interest in pump storage, even the potential for new interconnector links with Scandinavia, for example. Discussions have been had at a very broad level of being able to see the benefits of linking our massive expansion of, say, offshore wind and intermittent </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">renewables</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> with pump storage in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Scandinavia</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, where they have excess capacity. That is just one technology. There is a whole range of other technologies and applications. You raised the issue of battery storage associated with electric cars, which is another more distributive model equally deserving of further funding and support.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q281</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Power to gas can produce low-carbon gas, which is a high-value fuel.

I think making gas from power would be one possible solution—making hydrogen from power. Indeed, you can have local solutions using anaerobic digestion plants and making biogas, and putting that in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">pipes. Again, there are isolated examples of that going on. So I think it is possible. It will depend on how the commercials and the economics of all these different alternatives stack up. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q282</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir Robert Smith:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You touched earlier on the whole-systems approach and the need to be holistic and joined-up. One of the points put to us, especially with growing electrification and the talk about using cars and batteries, is about the smart grid and the time-of-use tariffs. How do time-of-use tariffs fit into the retail market review and the simplification of tariffs? Is it still possible to have a market for time-of-use tariffs in this new arrangement? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gregory Barker:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes, and what’s more time-of-use tariffs will really come into their own with the roll-out of smart meters. That is going to be a real game changer in terms of time-of-use tariffs, not only by allowing a more sophisticated relationship with the supplier, but by making it easier for consumers to understand and navigate their way through these tariffs, which can be complex. Also, it opens up the opportunity for consumers who are generating some of their own electricity to have a genuinely interactive relationship with suppliers and the grid. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q283</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir Robert Smith:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> But when it comes to trying to simplify the switching market, is there not going to be a challenge? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gregory Barker:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You’re right; there is a slight conundrum there. Simplicity is good for comparison, but if you are going to have time-of-use tariffs, they are, by definition, more complex the more sophisticated they become. If you introduce a new technology such as smart meters, that is a way of making that sophistication and complexity easier to understand and navigate for the typical consumer. Overall, we are trying to bring better understanding of and to shed some light on what had become a very complex market for all consumers to try to understand. The point you make about time-of-use tariffs is well made. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q284</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir Robert Smith:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I suppose that, with the smart meter historic data, you could start to shop around and see who would have given you the better—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gregory Barker:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Well, you can not only shop around but, with an open-ended interactive smart meter, you can have a much smarter relationship with your supplier, so that you could have real-time data that allows your smart meter to switch. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q285</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir Robert Smith:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> On the other side of joining up, how are Local Government, Transport and the other Departments integrated into trying to take a whole-systems energy approach? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">David </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Wagstaff</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Well, they are integrated; that is the good news.

DCLG is </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">probably the closest, because of the built environment question and also because of planning and—as you say—local government. There is another part of the Department that is leading on this whole model development; I think they are putting in place some governance.
