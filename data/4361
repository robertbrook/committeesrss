May I welcome you and particularly welcome the people involved in the Royal Society pairing scheme, many of whom are sitting at the back? I hope you find this a useful part of your time in Parliament. Sir Mark, you have been in post for a number of months now. You have started to get your feet firmly under the table. I had the privilege of listening to your lecture on Monday at the Natural History Museum, where you covered a huge amount of ground. Would you give us some specific examples of how you are doing the job differently from John </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Beddington</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">; how your experience from the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Wellcome</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Trust has impinged upon the way you carry out your role; and perhaps give us a flavour of how you are conducting the business today?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Mark </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Walport</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Thank you very much indeed. First, I would like to pay tribute to my predecessor, Sir John </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Beddington</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, and say that there are some things I am not doing differently from him because he was doing them extremely well. Looking at how I am thinking about the job, I am prioritising my activity in relation to what I think is important for Government. It seems to me that Government care</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">s</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> about two things: the health, well-being, resilience and security of the population; and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">it</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">worries </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">about the economy.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">My role, as you know, is to advise on science, engineering, technology and social science with respect to Government policy. Those two areas of Government concern form a useful framework for how I think about the job. If you think about the health, well-being, resilience and security of the country, a great deal of that is provided by our infrastructure. You can divide our infrastructure into our built, engineered infrastructure and our natural infrastructure, by which I mean plant and animal health, the environment, weather, climate. That provides a framework for how I think about the job. I essentially have five priority areas. One concerns our infrastructure. If you start looking at that, one of the most important infrastructures is our energy infrastructure, because if the lights go out, not only this building </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">but the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> plunges into darkness and things stop working. I have done a lot of work on climate and energy in relation to natural infrastructure.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Science is extremely important in emergencies, and here I would like to pay particular tribute to John </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Beddington</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, because he paid a lot of attention to that. He set up the Scientific Advisory Groups in Emergencies Committee, which feeds into </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">COBR</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, about which I could say more later. We are doing a lot of work on the national risk register, in order that we are best prepared not only to deal with emergencies when they happen, but as far as possible to prevent them from happening in the first place, to mitigate them, to handle them and then to clear up afterwards.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">On the economy, there is a very important relationship between science, engineering, and technology—for the rest of this session I will abbreviate that phrase to science—and between industry, academia and Government. So I am spending a lot of time visiting and talking to scientists working in each of those sectors, to try to join them up and provide the best policy environment for the progression of our world-leading science in the academic sector, all the way through to our world-leading science in industry. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The fourth and fifth areas are a leadership role in science and engineering, and getting out there and making sure that, as far as possible, both quantitative and qualitative evidence is used effectively in Government policy making. So that is how I think about it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In terms of how I operate, the job of Government chief scientist is only made possible by the network of advice that is available and the office itself, the Government Office for Science, which is strong and has a very good team of people in it. As you know because you meet them fairly regularly, there are </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">chief</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> scientists in other Government Departments, and we work as a network. We have agreed that between us, we have most of the domain skills in the different areas of science, engineering and technology to be able to provide advice not only within Government Departments but across Government. So it is agreed that CSAs will use their specific domain skills across the whole of Government. For example, Robin Grimes, the chief scientific adviser at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, is a nuclear physicist and his work is particularly useful in relation to our work with the Japanese at the stricken plant at </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Fukushima</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. His expertise is also useful in considering nuclear energy policy in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> as a whole. We tend to do that with each of the Government scientists, using their skills across Government. That is the network of advice within Government. As you know, we have a very strong Government science and engineering network, with over 12,000 scientists, and I am working closely with them. Then I am working with scientists in academia, in the learned academies, in industry and through my work co-chairing the Council for Science and Technology with Dame Nancy </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Rothwell</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I suppose, just to wind up the introductory remarks, another cut of the work is looking at the six themes that have emerged. I am happy to expand on any of them, but one is risk and resilience—the work on the national risk register and the national risk assessment. The second concerns energy and climate change, and the third data and analytics, which I gave a talk on in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Oxford</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> last night. The fourth concerns life course </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">and</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">demography</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—given that all sorts of demographic issues are important for Government policy—and cities. We have a new Foresight Programme, led by Sir Alan Wilson, on future cities. There is a work stream on innovation and infrastructure, and finally, the sixth is broadly around trade and finance, with a particular city perspective and an international perspective. So that is how I am thinking about the job. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Have you come across any unpleasant shocks? For example, there have been rumours and stories in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Th</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">e Guardian</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> recently about cuts in various aspects of the science budget. This Committee has identified areas of concern in respect of science—not in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills but in other Government Departments. Have you any particular worries?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Mark </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Walport</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> First, as you know, part of my primary responsibility is not actually the research-based science budgets, although obviously I am concerned to make sure that our scientific infrastructure is as strong as it possibly could be. So I have a general role in terms of advocacy within Government for science and science budgets. What I am concerned about with respect to departmental science budgets is that Departments be able to get the scientific advice they need to make effective policy. I have a general concern, but not a specific responsibility or accountability for the budgets themselves.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q3</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Finally, before I open this up to colleagues, you mentioned the national risk register, which we have looked at extremely closely. We are very impressed with John </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Beddington’s</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> work there. The issue of anti-microbial resistance is going further up the interest scale, the concern scale. Do you think it is an issue that deserves to be on the risk register?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Mark </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Walport</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think my colleague Dame Sally Davies has articulated the case very well indeed. Yes, it probably does deserve a slot on the risk register, but there are many things there. The risk register is subject to continuous review. My main concern is that it is not sufficient just to have it—it is a question of then using it to make decisions about what protections should be in place and how one should prepare and, hopefully, prevent the risks ever transpiring. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q4</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">  </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">David </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tredinnick</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Sir Mark, you have set out your stall with the five top priority areas. Which of those would you consider to be of the greatest importance? A tough question to start off. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Mark </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Walport</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The honest truth is that they are all important. Our infrastructure is extremely important—the country depends on it, so it is very high priority. Equally, when an emergency arises, we have to be prepared. To some extent, prioritisation at any particular time is dictated by events, and in the event that an emergency transpired, that of course would trump everything else. But I think these are all important priorities.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q5</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">David </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tredinnick</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So these are all shifting priorities?

I think that wouldn’t be a bad legacy to leave, but I am not starting from a blank sheet of paper in any sense at all. If you look at the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> system of scientific advice for Government, it is probably one of the most comprehensive—if not the most comprehensive—in the world. So the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> starts in a very strong position. It would be nice to think that, wherever possible, science is one of the key lenses through which policy makers look at the world and on which they base their decisions.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q9</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Heath:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> In my reasonably recent past I have had very good reason to be grateful to Ian Boyd and to John </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Beddington</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> for the advice they gave as we had a new plague or pestilence every other week to deal with. I wonder whether, in your view, you feel that Departments across Government have the capacity to deal with “events”, as you described them previously, on the basis of the advice. Do they have the capacity in terms of contingency planning and in terms of what they can bring to bear in order to face an adverse event of some kind?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Mark </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Walport</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Of course, we will probably come on to this more in the next session, which is on Horizon Scanning, and Horizon Scanning is an extremely important part of activity. I am certainly satisfied that the national risk assessment is something that is owned by all Government Departments. I also think that it has been discussed both at the level of the Cabinet and at the level of the permanent secretar</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">ie</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">s</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> meeting each week in the last couple of months, so this is very hot in people’s minds at the moment.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There is always more work that can be done on that, and it will be done. I think in terms of the contingency planning that, yes, a great deal of contingency planning does happen. It is one of the areas that I was impressed with—something that is less visible when you are outside Government. People have sometimes asked me, “What has surprised you coming into Government?” and one of the pleasant surprises has been the number of people in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">around </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Whitehall</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> who work on actually defending us against all sorts of events, both natural and human-contrived. That, I would say, is very positive. Is there more that can be done with the national risk assessment? Yes, I believe there is. I have been involved in a couple of contingency exercises and I think we could do more in terms of preparing the manuals to actually help us handle them when they occur, and that work has already started. So I think that there is a lot to do.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The other question is if you look forward and say, “What is the next pandemic going to be? What is the next human, animal or plant infection going to be?” I think that the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is good at public health. I think that the evidence base for animal and plant health, as I think I have said here before, is less well developed and it is perhaps not surprising that more has been spent around the world on human health compared with animal and plant health. But I think that as the interconnections on the planet become ever faster, then of course infections can move faster than they ever moved before. So I think there that there is more that we can do in terms of collecting the evidence on that and I am working closely with Ian Boyd and DEFRA to explore how we can do this even better.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q10</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Heath:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you think that there is more we could do in terms of intelligence of what is happening elsewhere, given that global dimension which is still there?

But a meta-analysis without primary evidence isn’t much use. Equally, lots of primary evidence that isn’t put together into a meta-analysis isn’t much use either.

The short answer is that one can do as much as one can to anticipate infections jumping from one species to another, but this is something of an intractable science at the moment, so that would be a major issue for the UK. Are we prepared in a general sense for pandemics without knowing the detail of what they are going to be? Yes, I think we are rather well prepared for that. Nevertheless, some infections are very nasty indeed, so that would be one example. There are all sorts of horrible things that one could imagine and what one has to do is prepare for reasonable best-case scenarios.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q13</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Heath:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> One of the most difficult things for scientists to get over to legislators and the media, and possibly on occasions even to Ministers, is risk, how you quantify risk and what it actually means.

One of the big issues is the confusion that sometimes happens. There is a whole series of terms associated with risk. There is risk, hazard, uncertainty, vulnerability and threat. If you understand risk, then you need to think about all these other things as well. One of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">important confusions that happens regularly is a confusion between hazard and risk. As an illustration, each of our kitchens is full of hazards. We have very sharp knives, we have bleach and we have salt, which is actually rather dangerous if you eat too much of it. Even water, if you drink too much of it, can cause serious harm. We manage each of those hazards by controlling our exposure, so risk is the product of hazard times exposure. That is where, I think, we get into trouble all the time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">As you know, I had a certain discussion with George </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Monbiot</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> over </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">neonicotinoid</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> pesticides</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.

The idea when you apply pesticides is that you expose the insects you don’t want to toxic concentrations and the plan is that you don’t expose the insects you don’t want exposed.

Therefore, to get the most out of those renewable sources we also need better ways of storing energy. We have to look at the whole cycle of how we use energy and part of that is about reducing our demand. Part of it is also about evening out our demand because our supply system is designed to deal with the peaks.

Academics need to understand the issues of policy makers. When people are looking at policy, science is rarely the only lens through which they look. It is important that scientists understand that policy making is a bit more complicated than reading the latest paper and making a decision. Equally, it is important that policy makers understand the method and rigour of science. It is about better communication between the two communities. Is it heading in the right direction? Again, I think it is, but there is much more to be gained. As I said right at the beginning, I cannot do my job without effective interaction with the academic community. Equally, the academic community has to learn how policy makers think and how policy is made.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q40</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Stephen Mosley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So if you have an academic out there doing some research that they think might be useful for Government, how do they ensure that that information is fed back up to policy makers?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Mark </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Walport</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> There are two things to say. First, it is very rare for a single piece of research to be the basis on which a policy decision is made. It is not a case of, “I have just produced my latest paper and—gosh!—the results are exciting and we must change policy”, because we all know that science proceeds on the basis of a number of studies showing similar things. There are questions of reproducibility. Science has to be tested and it is a sceptical process.

When people who are very ill come into accident and emergency, you have to work out what is going on very quickly.
