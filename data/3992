font-size:11pt">Not only does BBC Worldwide help to fund the making of programmes that the BBC on its own may not be able to finance, its existence might also give the BBC the confidence to be more ambitious in its programming.  For example, if the BBC is confident that i</span><span style="font-family:Arial;
