Yet the procurement approach adopted appears to have been geared to creating a commodity market rather than an added-value market.  For example, it is understood that the procurement approach has reduced costs for some volume crime forensic work (which is more linear and less integrated in nature and less robustly contested in court), but there are indications that the high-end national capacity and capability, especially for complex cases such as serious crime and terrorism, has been threatened.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">A report by the US Academy of Sciences (Strengthening Forensic Science in the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">US</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: A Path Forward: 2009) recommended the separation of forensic provision from the investigating authority (police) for reasons of quality management and cognitive/selection bias.

(please provide evidence/examples) </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">(i) The reduction in national capacity caused by the closure of FSS has affected FSNI’s ability to broker excess work at peak demand periods and reduced the Agency’s resilience and ability to meet its turnaround times. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The increased reliance on police in-house forensics (unless systematically and structurally mitigated) also potentially increases the risk of cognitive or selection bias in relation to the exhibits selected for forensic examination, the choice of examinations conducted or not conducted on them and the subsequent objective evaluation of the evidence. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">In the interests of justice, forensic evaluation reports often need to be caveated in the light of such issues.  As outlined above, the 2009 US Academy of Sciences report recommended the operational independence of forensic science laboratories from the investigating authority (police).  We are unaware of any strategic consideration of this operational independence issue during the FSS transition and the drive to in-house services within police forces. Quality Accreditation, with its mandatory self-critical approach, including peer reviews, quality audits, case assessments etc. is highly relevant, especially when much in-housing was, as we understand it, carried out in the absence of any quality accreditation. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">There are also concerns on the related issue of the ability of a commercial provider to request additional (potentially exculpatory) exhibits or examinations in the interests of justice (and in so doing increase their own revenues) whilst still being accepted as completely objective.  </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:5pt 0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">There were also some indications of distortion in cost comparisons between in-housing (without accreditation) versus external provision (with full accreditation). Additional costs are associated with accreditation fees but more significantly with the workings of a good quality management system, such as peer reviews, internal audits, blind trials etc. which are essential in preserving the integrity and objectivity of the science. Such quality on-costs are significant.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">(ii)  FSS was a recognised world leader in R&amp;D.  FSNI was collaborating with FSS on R&amp;D in several areas at the time of the closure announcement. With the closure of FSS, the burden of R&amp;D falls largely on commercial providers. However, with the contestable market having shrunk and with profit margins squeezed by the procurement process, there is little incentive for investment by the commercial companies in R&amp;D, especially given the high capital costs and restructuring costs associated with the relatively short procurement contracts. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">We would have some initial concerns regarding the proposed approach to R&amp;D for forensics, as outlined by the UK Technology Strategy Board’s FoSci Special Interest Group presentation to AFSP.  </span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:150%; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">There is a risk of Forensic Science R&amp;D being marginalised if included in the much larger crime detection and prevention portfolio.</span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:150%; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The focus on the creation of Intellectual Property (IP) from which UK PLC could generate economic benefit is not highly applicable to Forensic Science R&amp;D, which is much more about the adaptation, application and validation of existing technologies.

The market size is very small in comparative terms and given its dynamics and barriers to entry, it is by no means certain that it will remain attractive to current or potential providers. The high costs of bidding for contracts (in terms of capital investment in labs, staff etc.) act as disincentives, as does the somewhat commoditised nature of the procurement approach. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:5pt 0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Forensic science is not primarily a commodity service, except in those few disciplines based on lower value, standardised, straightforward, high volume processes (and even then only in the testing, as distinct from the evaluation aspects, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">viz </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">DNA). It is in essence a technical business-to-business market.  Such markets normally function best where value is added to the business processes of the buyer through partnership working and is reflected in healthy margins and long term relationships for the providers, thus incentivising them to further develop their services for mutual benefit. There is limited evidence that such a market dynamic has developed and there is a significant risk of an exit from the market by one or more providers, which would further reduce national capacity and capability.   </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:5pt 0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">This issue is compounded by the lack of any economic model that links forensic expenditure to monetary and other benefits in police investigations, criminal justice processes, or societal outcomes related to the improved detection, investigation and deterrence of crime facilitated by improved forensics. In the absence of such a model, commoditisation of the market through the dominance of direct cost to the police becomes the default.   </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:5pt 0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:5pt 0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">6.  How are forensic science services procured by police forces and could procurement processes be improved? </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:5pt 0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">FSNI do not bid for procurement contracts with police forces in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">England</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> and </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Wales</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. However, short-term contracts are by their nature destabilising in a service requiring reliable local accessible presence by competent suppliers.

It would generally be sensible to assign work on one case (or set of related cases) to a single provider to avoid fragmentation of the forensics and the individual case management. This approach might help create a more genuine added-value market and one for which providers would be better incentivised to invest in service improvement over the longer term.     </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:5pt 0pt 5pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:5pt 0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">7.  Has the closure of the FSS resulted in a loss of intellectual wealth through its scientists leaving the forensic science profession, or the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">?
