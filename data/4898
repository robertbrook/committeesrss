We have both lay partners and professional partners who work with us on a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">sessional</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> basis and are involved in the day-to-day decision making of the regulator. They are the ones who handle things right from the registration process, so deciding who comes on to the register, through to visits to universities, so approval and quality assurance of education programmes, and all the fitness-to-practise work that we do. The system could not operate without the expertise of those individuals. Obviously, the recruitment, training and quality assurance processes for those partners are important to how we work. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q3 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Would it be fair to characterise it, in a sense, as 16 sub-regulators with an umbrella? What is the common element across the 16 professions?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Marc Seale:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> No, it is very not like that. From day 1, the organisation was set up where we do the things identically wherever possible; we try to not be different for different professions. In that way I think you get a very efficient regulator. When we started doing that, the reaction of the professional bodies to the idea, for example, that you could have the same sort of standards for the professions was, “How can that possibly work, if at one end of the spectrum you have clinical scientists and at the other end of the spectrum you have arts therapists?” Our view was that you can set up a regulator where you have common processes and systems, and I think we have demonstrated that it really works very efficiently.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I think there are three reasons for that. The first is that if you have lots of professions and professional bodies, you tend to try to come up with a degree of consensus, so the extreme views—the very odd ways of doing things—are eliminated and you get a good, solid centre. The second is a technical thing that you avoid regulatory capture by the professions that you are regulating, because one profession does not have that huge influence on the regulator. The third component is that you get economies of scale and therefore you can deliver regulation very effectively as well.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q4 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you think that there are lessons to be learnt by other professional regulators from the way you apply the principles you have just described?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr van </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">der</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gaag</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> That is absolutely right.

We have a lot of contact with, for example, the Malaysians, the Singaporeans, the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Republic</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Ireland</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and, in particular, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Australia</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, where they have gone from </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">96 separate organisations into a single regulator.

From our point of view, that is very much a step forward. Health and social care are increasingly becoming integrated and the desire to see more integration from the public’s perspective is growing. That message is growing in strength and influence. To have regulation that is integrated and is the same across all the professions resonates with what is happening outside regulation itself.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q8 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">David </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tredinnick</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I want to ask you about something to do with drug and drink-related offences. The PSA told us it was disappointed that the HCPC has not accepted its recommendations that regulators should routinely request a health assessment for all registrants who are convicted of a drug or drink-related offence.

The issue for us is more about how we deal with those cases. Our assertion is that each case should be looked at individually: the circumstances surrounding drink-driving, for example, can be very different for different registrants and therefore the case-by-case approach that we take is, we think, fair, proportionate and appropriate for those on our register. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Having said that, we have set out clear criteria in our guidance on where a drink or drug-related offence will be taken through to an investigation stage—for example, if it is a repeat offence; if the offence occurs during the course of the registrant carrying out professional duties; if there is any sense that there were aggravating circumstances, such as a failure to provide a specimen or failure to co-operate with the police; or if the penalty imposed exceeds the maximum mandatory disqualification. We have those four criteria that automatically lead to further investigation, but we must be absolutely clear on whether the actual incident has an impact on fitness to practise. There are instances where that is not the case, so to take a blanket approach, in our view, is not the right approach.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q9 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">David </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tredinnick</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The breathalyser that the police administer is, some would say, quite random.

First, how does a professional maintain their continuing fitness to practise? Secondly, if you are asked to demonstrate it, how do you demonstrate as a professional that you are fit to practise? Thirdly, what should a regulator do to audit that process? We think it is very important to use those three components in how we look at our registrants’ fitness to practise.

We have had the system in place since 2006 and we ask our registrants to keep up to date; to keep a record of their continuing professional development activities; and to make sure that these activities benefit patients and service users and have an impact on the quality of what they do. Those are the clear and simple messages that we give to registrants. Those are mandatory standards that have been in place since 2006.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Since 2008, we have been auditing a proportion of those on the register to ensure compliance. If they are selected for audit, they have to submit evidence to us, which is assessed by trained assessors working in pairs. They make a judgment about whether the profile is meeting the standards that we set. To date, we have audited about 11,500 individuals, of which a very small proportion have been removed from the register because they have failed to meet the standards: 0.7% have been removed from the register and a further 4% have voluntarily deregistered—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">having been selected for audit, they have disengaged from the process. We have now audited all the professions except social workers, who have just recently come into regulation by HCPC, and some of them are now in the second round of audits. In terms of compliance, the numbers are pretty consistent across the 15 professions that we regulate. The system is there to assess compliance. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The other thing I want to say to provide an overview of the system is that we spent a long time engaging with the professions when we introduced these CPD standards. We emphasised the outcomes-focused approach, which is about how continuing professional development activity benefits service users and patients. It is about outcomes, not the amount of activity undertaken. We also strongly emphasised that reflection on practice—keeping a reflective diary and thinking about the impact of learning activities on professional practice—was a key element of the process. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We have been advocating the outcomes-focused approach, the reflective approach, for the past six to seven years. It has taken time to convince some of the professions of its value, but the feedback we get now is that they recognise that the reflective process and the outcomes-based approach add value and are a more motivating force than a points system or </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">an hours-based approach to continuing professional development. We certainly want to do more research—for example, into the impact of work setting on CPD activity. We also want to look at differentials between the professions—at the moment we do not see any great differentials in terms of pass/fail, but we have more work that we want to do in that respect. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Returning to your point about rigour, we are much more aligned with some of the models of quality assurance and continuing competence in other parts of the globe than we are with the GMC’s model. For example, in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Canada</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> the emphasis is on supporting the 5% of poor practitioners to improve, rather than the 95% of practitioners who the evidence shows do an excellent job. There is a difference here in the model, but our view is that it is rigorous enough and it encourages a dialogue about reflection and the outcomes-focused approach, which we believe has more of an impact on professional practice in the long term. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q11 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Sharma:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> When you talk about assessors, are they independent assessors, or is it an internal organisation, with somebody from a different department doing the audit? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr van </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">der</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gaag</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> They are our assessors. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q12 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Sharma:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So they are independent. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr van </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">der</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gaag</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> They are independent from the registrant and the organisation that the registrant works with.

First, I would say that a large number of our registrants, when they submit their profiles to us, already include patient feedback as one of the elements—one of the pieces of evidence. That is something that they are already doing, and they have been doing it since the first audits began in 2008. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We commissioned some independent research on this, and a very comprehensive review of very many different types of patient feedback tools. The very clear recommendation that came back to us from Picker Europe, which undertook the research, was that there is no</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">one size fits </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">all</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in relation to patient feedback tools.  If you want to receive authentic and valuable feedback from, say, somebody with a learning disability, somebody who has had a stroke, or perhaps a young person who is coming to use mental health services, you need different tools.  The work that we are doing now is around looking at the different types of tools that have been developed and validated with different client groups, rather than saying to our registrants, “We want you to use one tool,” which we believe will be, in the end, a blunt instrument and will not say very much about the person’s view of the practitioner. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I think that is very much supported by a very large study commissioned some years ago and published in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">British</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Medical Journal</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.

They are much better used when they are part of a much more comprehensive feedback on a health professional’s performance. So, again, we are taking note of that research and looking for a variety of ways of involving patients and service users in giving feedback to our registrants.

I wonder whether you would like to reflect on that proposition. Is it not true in reality that there is a gradient?

I was talking specifically about the evidence from around the world that shows that the number of professionals who come before fitness to practice hearings is very small. The number of complaints about health and care professionals, relative to the numbers on registers, is actually very small. I was talking specifically about the Canadian model, which focuses its quality assurance or continuing competence efforts on that 5%, rather than on the 95%. Nevertheless, I think that regulators have a very important role to play in influencing the culture.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Just to give you one example from our own work, going back a number of years we commissioned some research on professionalism, specifically because we were aware from our own analysis of fitness to practice hearings that the vast majority of complaints are about ethics, behaviour and conduct. If that is the case, then in a sense our responsibility as a regulator is to investigate that further and to initiate a dialogue with the professions about why that is happening and what can be done to improve or to prevent those sorts of conduct and behaviour issues from arising in other contexts. The professionalism research was done by an independent commission. The researchers were from the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">university</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Durham</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, and they looked first at the definitions and people’s understanding of professionalism. They asked students, those on the register and educators about how they would characterise professional and unprofessional behaviour. Through a series of workshops, both live and online, we took the results of that study to the registrants—we disseminated them widely—and used that research to generate discussion about professional and unprofessional behaviour.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Our aim was for there to be more debate and discourse about the issue, because in some ways it is easier to talk about a colleague’s technical incompetence than it is to talk about behaviours that are perhaps unacceptable. That has gained a huge amount of traction. We have had a great deal of interest in the report—it is one of the most downloaded reports on our website—and a lot of very good feedback. I suppose that for us that is an example of how we are trying to influence and contribute to a debate about what constitutes good and not so good professional practice, which goes back to your point about influencing culture.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q16 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Keeley</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Moving on specifically to the recommendations in the Francis report, a key issue to emerge was enabling the public and professionals to report concerns.

All those reports say the same thing, which is that there is a low level of awareness about this in general. Crucially, however, there is also a clear steer that, once people need to know where to go to make a complaint, they find it a much easier route. General awareness is low, but once someone needs to make a complaint they very quickly can either use the internet or find out through their GP, their pharmacy or a number of other mechanisms, where to come to make a complaint. It is about the general awareness versus the specific route to making a complaint or raising a concern.

Of course, it is important to make ourselves accessible by, for example, looking at our language, both written and what we put on the website, and making sure that there is literature published in easy-read formats and in other languages. We are doing that already but there is a lot more that we can still do to make sure that we are accessible and that people can then contact us and follow through with raising concerns. We would not be in any way complacent about that.

As a regulator the concern is always that the people who have issues and complaints are not making any contact with us and therefore are we failing because that information is not coming to us? A new bit of work has come out from something called the Health and Social Care Information Centre. It is only for one year and it only applies to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> but it is essentially a breakdown of the complaints that have come in from the NHS in relation to the professions. Of the 110,000 written complaints that came in, roughly 50% are related to medical, surgical individuals; 22% to nursing and midwifery; only 4% to the allied health professions and, interestingly, 4% for the ambulance crews. Now, as a regulator we get very, very small numbers compared with the other regulators but it matches that other information which has been collected for another reason, which is people writing in complaints to the NHS. So if you triangulate those two bits of information, it indicates to us that individuals who need to raise issues about the people we </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">regulate are getting to us in the right proportion because it matches that written information that is coming in to the Health and Social Care Information Centre.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q18 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Keeley</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The Francis report highlighted the need for better joined-up working between different regulators.

We have seen examples and talked them through here where an issue that should have been investigated got dropped between two regulators. Presumably there was a memorandum of understanding, but there have been examples, which the report highlighted, where it is just did not work between regulators.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Marc Seale:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> In my view MOUs are, frankly, interesting bits of paper, but what you have to be concerned about is what is happening on an operational level within the regulators. When something comes up—for example, if we get a complaint against a medic arriving at our door—do we do something about it and is that information going across to other regulators? I think MOUs are a fig leaf in terms of what we are doing. I also think that there is a tendency—I have seen it from the Shipman inquiry and various things—to say, “Oh, we are having meetings. The chief executives are getting together and we do this once a month.” There is a lot of enthusiasm at the first and second meetings, but gradually that disappears. What you have to do, and what we as the regulator try to do, is to make those contacts with other regulators. For example, we have picked up cases from other regulators—for example in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—that have been in contact with us because we have had an individual on our register. The person came off our register and then went off to the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and did something totally inappropriate. Someone then said, “Actually, they have now gone back to the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,” so those organisations phone us up and make contact, because we know them. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">To me, it is about personal contact, building up that trust, and making sure that other regulators and organisations know about your existence so that the information comes across to you. Having meetings and MOUs is not going to achieve that. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q19 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Keeley</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> That sounds like quite a big challenge, given the breadth of the professions that you cover. What difference does it make that you cover so many?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Marc Seale:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> If anything, I think it makes it easier, because we have a bigger presence, so people are more likely to know about us. Because we are a multi-profession regulator, and we are doing things differently in terms of how we operate, we have a constant stream of people from other countries coming to see us.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Again, there is a new thing that we are doing, and it is something that we have to learn about. Because the regulation of social work is a devolved issue—unlike with, say, physiotherapists—when we took on social work, we had to make the effort to go to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to make contact with organisations that had more experience than us and more understanding of what was going on, and to ensure that those relationships work. But, no, if you are a multi-profession regulator, I think it makes your job easier than if you were a single regulator of a single profession.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr van </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">der</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gaag</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I would just add that we invest hugely in communication and engagement. We see that as an absolutely essential part of what we do. In terms of the professions that we regulate, we have an open-door policy. If they want to contact us about anything at all, or raise concerns with us that are perhaps at a macro level, we are there. We have regular meetings, at all levels of the organisation, with officers.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Equally, we need to be in touch with organisations that are there to represent patients and service users. One initiative that has come out of Francis is work that we are doing at the moment with the Patients Association, where it is reviewing our complaints processes. There will be huge learning from that. It has set standards on complaints, and we want to know whether we meet those standards and in what way could we improve from the association’s perspective. Obviously, our hope is that, by going through that scrutiny process—we are the first regulator to do so—there will be learning that we can share with our colleagues in the other professional regulatory bodies. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Marc Seale:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Can I just chuck in one other thing, because I know that you have been talking to the other regulators?  One of the issues that you have been raising is anonymous complaints—when the registrant or professional does not want to make contact. We have a power in our legislation called the 22(6) that enables myself as the registrar to make the complaint. For example, if there are two biomedical scientists, and one of them has concerns about the other who is working in the same laboratory, but feels very uncomfortable about making the complaint themselves, if they contact us, give us the right information and say, “Look, I really don’t want to go to the next stage,” I, as the registrar, make the allegation or complaint. That is a very efficient way of dealing with this issue about, “Hang on, you are not actually going to pick those ones up.” It is a simple bit of legislation, but it works very effectively.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q20 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Is that unique to you in your regulatory field?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Marc Seale:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I know my legislation pretty well, but I cannot give you an answer to that. However, one hopes that the very effective bit of Law Commission legislation coming down the road will be applicable to all the regulators. We would certainly be very disappointed if it wasn’t, and I am pretty sure it is going to be in the new legislation from the Law Commission.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q21 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrew George:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You have taken on responsibility for the registration and oversight of social work since August 2012. It appears to me, on the face of it, looking at the statistics, that re-registration seems to have gone relatively efficiently. Taking on a profession with such a large number of registrants—83,500—what skills do you have? You talked about the benefits of being a multi-profession regulator, but what skills do you have to oversee and regulate social workers?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Marc Seale:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> When you look at an organisation such as ourselves as a regulator, there are two components. There is the expertise in running the infrastructure—do you have good IT systems, the right processes, the right esprit de corps within the organisation and the right culture that enables you to deliver regulation? But, if you are a multi-profession regulator, and if, let us say, you are approving a university programme, looking at an international application or sitting on a tribunal, you absolutely need the in-depth professional understanding of that profession, and that can come only from professionals. If you are a multi-profession regulator, how do you deal with that? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What we do is to have what we call our partners—about 800-plus individuals from the professions who work on our behalf when we need professional input to the process</span><a name="_ftnref2"></a><a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. If you are sitting on a tribunal about a physiotherapist, you will have two physiotherapists on that tribunal. If you are approving a new social work programme, which we are doing at the moment, we run the infrastructure to make sure that individuals are trained and know what to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">do, but the visitors, as we call them, will be social workers. At the operational level, that is how we get the input from the professional element. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">On other occasions there are what I call working groups. For example, when we brought the social workers on board, what standards should we have for that? We do not have any social workers in the organisation, so we set up a working group that is populated by members of the profession.  The last equally important component is the governance arrangement. Anna, do you want to talk through that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr van </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">der</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gaag</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Certainly in terms of our own governance, we have been very fortunate. We have a social worker on the governing council, so clearly we get expertise at a strategic, oversight level. In terms of having the right expertise in the right place at the right time, we have an established record on engagement and communication, and on making sure that, where we need expertise, we seek it out. We make no pretence of knowing about social work practice, but we make sure that we bring in experts from the field and recruit them as our partners, as Marc has said. If we have to develop standards, we make sure that we have people from all elements and areas of the profession involved in that process.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The other thing that has been very important is that social work has been going through huge upheaval in recent years. For example, we have been involved in the Social Work Reform Board and the recommendations from that. We have supported those and are doing what we can as the regulatory body to implement them, working very closely with the professional bodies in social work so that there is an alignment there, which I think is very important.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Marc Seale:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> May I jump in? I think the other thing is that it is very much a two-way process. When we have brought the psychologists, the Hearing Aid Council, the operating department practitioners and the social workers on board, we, as an organisation, have adapted our processes. For example, when we took on the regulation of psychologists, we fundamentally changed some of our standards because they were very scientifically orientated—in fact, they did not fit in very well with groups such as OTs and arts therapists. It has to be seen as a two-way process. We have as much to learn about the profession that we are bringing in as a regulator as in the other direction. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q22 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrew George:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> On that note, do you accept that if you look across all the professions that you regulate—from biomedical scientists and paramedics and others—for which one might say that, if you had questions of professional competence or even malice that might be part of a complaint, one might argue that there is a way of objectifying the assessment of whether a person is competent to do the job or the complaint is upheld? However, in the area of social work, there is more likely to be a subjective judgment on whether they have correctly assessed a very difficult-to-assess human relationship. We know about circumstances in which some local authorities have taken children into care if they had a bruise, while in other cases you get a baby P scenario when they were prepared to take risks to keep family units together which, on reflection, was perhaps not wise. In those circumstances, do you not accept that some of the judgments that you have to make can be objectified and that others are deeply subjective? How do you as a body manage to cope with circumstances in which opinions may vary across the profession about how to deal with such circumstances?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr van </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">der</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gaag</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think that that is an important point. I do see that there will be circumstances in which there will be much clearer objective parameters around a judgment, and others where the nature of the relationship—how it is interpreted and how it is </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">understood—will be very difficult, because there will often be diametrically opposed views on that relationship. That certainly is the case in social work practice, and we would be very aware of it. I think it would also be the case in other disciplines—perhaps not to the same extent, but certainly in psychology, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, and arts therapy—that there would be those perhaps more subjective elements and judgments to be made.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Again, we are at the early stage. Social workers came into regulation by HCPC last August. Clearly we have lots of learning to do, and we will be doing in-depth analysis of the cases as time goes on. If we look back at the cases that we have had, the numbers that are on the objective end of the spectrum are very small for all the professions. Again, going back to what I would call the conduct/competence split, last year only 8% of our fitness to practise hearings were entirely about what I would call technical competence or incompetence, and the rest were straight conduct issues or a combination of competence and conduct issues, so again you are getting that mix of the objective and subjective, and the judgments that these panels have to make are very complex, just as you describe.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q23 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrew George:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> In terms of the advice, you said that you appoint, or at least identify, a set of social work professionals whom you can call upon when you are seeking advice and dealing with the complaints that you are handling. How many are there, and how do you go about selecting people to act as your advisers?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Marc Seale:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We select them by advertising in journals and communicating with the professional bodies, and through open competition. We recruit them against criteria and we give them a lot of training and retraining, appraisal and reappointment, and more training—we can never give enough training. That can be on the processes that we run, changes in legislation and feedback from, let us say, court decisions or tribunals that we have undertaken, so it is a constant process. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">At the same time, we have to make sure there is a reasonable turnover. You do not just want the good and the great from the professions sitting on your group, so we try to bring in the younger members of the profession to make sure it works. We regulate across </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Wales</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Northern Ireland</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, and we actively try to make sure that we get members of groups from the various countries.

You are currently looking at the possibility of negative registration. Bearing in mind what the PSA has said—it does not currently appear to be terribly enamoured with or convinced by your proposal—and given the existence of the Disclosure and Barring Service in any case, as well as the role of the CQC, I wondered what added value there would be in creating a negative register?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr van </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">der</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gaag</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> My understanding is that the PSA is interested in the proposals, but not yet convinced of exactly what part they would play. We are very interested in conversations with the PSA about that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In terms of what this contributes that the current system does not, clearly the delivery of safe and effective care is critical in this sector, and the many agencies involved are as concerned as we are about the issue of safety and effectiveness. In fact, the Cavendish review makes very strong and powerful recommendations about training, supervision and local mechanisms to ensure that care workers are delivering safe and appropriate care.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">As a regulator, we have obviously had many conversations with employers and those in the sector about this issue, and we are aware that there are a number of what you might call serial offenders—people who move from one care setting to another. If there has been an incident, they are either disciplined or asked to leave, and then they move on and find employment five miles down the road—or, more often, 50 miles down the road. What we would see as unacceptable behaviours then recur in another setting. There is currently no mechanism for holding those individuals to account.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The sector very much supports a statutory code of conduct. Skills for Care has carefully developed a code of conduct for care workers, but there are no legal powers to enforce it. We are proposing a statutory code that would allow us to investigate serious complaints about individuals who are not delivering appropriate care.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In relation to how that would interact with the disclosure and barring scheme, we would see it as very much complementing but playing a different role from the DBS, because that scheme has a higher threshold. We know that because we regularly make referrals for our own cases to the DBS, and to date in only 36% of them has the system then acknowledged that the individual should be barred. For example, in cases where there has been physical or sexual assault, or sexually inappropriate behaviour towards vulnerable individuals, those individuals have not been barred by the scheme. There is a different threshold. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Our contention is that there needs to be a safety net—a way of holding individuals to account against a statutory code. However, that does not in any way diminish the importance of other local mechanisms—local training, local support, local supervision and good employment practices—for what I would call the low-level complaints and the capability issues that are currently dealt with by employers. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q25 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrew George:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> One of the PSA’s concerns is that there would not be a sufficient incentive; it is not reassured that employers would refer cases on. One could imagine that companies that employ care workers might fear the reputational damage from acting properly and referring matters to the police. Under your proposal, will there be a way of ensuring that referrals are handled in a manner that does not discourage employers from highlighting concerns about the behaviour or actions of their employees? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Marc Seale:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We were quite surprised by the PSA’s attitude to the proposals. Our understanding from discussions with stakeholders is that they are concerned that there is no protection at the current moment in time. They cannot do anything, and they are very frustrated. But if there is a system in which they know that that standards they can trust from an independent regulator will apply, they will take account of it, because they can differentiate themselves from other organisations that do not put those services in place. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The other component is that many individuals on domiciliary visits are hired by individuals. They do not go into an organisation, but they go into an aged relation’s house to deliver the service. We think that there should be standards, which are the core of regulation. We have put up proposals that show that this is an efficient, effective way—again, it is being run in other countries. It is not professional regulation, which is for individuals who do years of training, and have skills and expertise that are not understood by someone such as me, the man in the street; it is an occupational system.

With a statutory register, you can charge professionals to come on to the register. The big problem with our scheme is that there is no register, and therefore you cannot charge individuals. Therefore, it may have to be funded by the Government, which is obviously a big negative thing. There is one of these systems up and running in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">New South Wales</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Australia</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, and the fitness to practise process is different because you are not approving university programmes, so the process is run at a much lower cost. If the Government does not pay for it, the alternative in a licensing scheme is, for example, if you are licensing care homes, to charge a levy on the care homes to pay for the negative licensing. But the costs are fundamentally different.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q28 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrew George:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I was going to suggest that it could be the care homes or the care companies, because presumably it would provide them with a degree of comfort and protection if they were to check their names through your negative register. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Marc Seale:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Absolutely.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr van </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">der</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gaag</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Certainly, we have had conversations with big and small providers—the English Community Care Association, for example, as well as many other big private providers—and their view is that this would give reassurance that there is a mechanism for dealing with these serious and often serial offences against vulnerable individuals. The other interesting thing from them is that they would certainly say that there is no business incentive to encourage membership of a voluntary registration scheme, but there is a business incentive for them, because of the reputational reassurance it would give, as you say, and the fact that there is a statutory mechanism that they can rely on.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q29 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you see this as a graduated series of standards?

It referred to a register of persons authorised to dispense unlicensed herbal medicines and proposed that we regulate herbal practitioners as non-medical public health specialists on a statutory basis. I shall go over a bit of the history of this, because I think it is important.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Professor Michael </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Pitillo</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, whom I knew well, produced in 2008 a comprehensive report on the regulation of practitioners of acupuncture, herbal medicine, traditional Chinese medicine and other traditional medicine systems practised in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. He concluded, to quote from his report: “</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We are firmly of the view that, in the interest of public safety, statutory regulation should now proceed with all possible speed</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">”.

I think it is very important to say that, in relation to the groups you mentioned, the PSA is not a regulator and it is not regulation. That is repeatedly said by Harry </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Cayton</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, and that is very important. It is an accreditation system. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Our view is that there are a range of professions that we have said very clearly should be statutorily regulated, but the Government, as we understand it, has decided that they should not be regulated. We are also concerned about the accreditation system. Our concern is that, by association, individuals imply that they are statutorily regulated by being part of the PSA accreditation system. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Essentially, our major issue is this: we were given powers in the last change to legislation to open voluntary registers. In fact, we were asked to open a voluntary register for the care workers, and we very firmly said no. The reason for that is that, first, there is no protection of title, so you cannot stop people using a title. Secondly, you cannot run fitness to practise, because you cannot demand witnesses to turn up and you cannot get hold of documentation. And, thirdly, if an individual drops off a voluntary register, you cannot take any action anyway. They are completely pointless in terms of what we do. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We can say that because until the HPC was set up, we had a system in the UK where you had physiotherapists who were SR-</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">ed</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—they would be regulated—and then people who called themselves physiotherapists who were not regulated. The public got very confused and then very angry when they went and were treated by a physiotherapist who they thought was </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">statutorily regulated but was not. We think that does not make sense—that is quite clear. None of the statutory regulators have opened voluntary registers and, when the Law Commission publishes its draft legislation, I think it will be fascinating to see what will be done with this anomaly. But those groups should be statutorily regulated.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q36 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">David </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tredinnick</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I do understand the difference in the two regulatory regimes, and I have had many discussions with Harry </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Cayton</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Marc Seale:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I am having a rant.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr van </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">der</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gaag</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> My observation would be to agree that it is not a very logical landscape.

First and foremost, the regulators are there to ensure public protection for the professions that are regulated.

My understanding from conversations with the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, Dan </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Poulter</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, is that he intends to leave it to the herbal practitioners and medicines working group to work this out. I think that all views will be given proper consideration in that committee. Let me ask you another question. Are there any financial considerations in the HCPC hoping to regulate herbal practitioners? Has it got anything to do with bringing in extra fees and the need for some kind of financial base? Is that a consideration? It has been a consideration with some regulatory bodies.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Marc Seale:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> From our perspective, we are not doing it for financial reasons. But when you look at what we would call an aspirant group, if you have a voluntary membership organisation, when they come into statutory regulation there is a financial challenge. The members of that group have to pay the registrant’s fees and that group must be fairly well established, because many of those individuals will say, “Well I am now statutorily regulated, why do I need to be a member of the professional body or the voluntary association that I have been part of?” When we talk to aspirant groups we say, “Look, this is likely to happen. Will your organisation be strong enough to deal with the potential loss of memberships as statutory regulation is opened?” </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The other component is that we have always argued, and the Government has very much supported us, that there is a cost of bringing a new group into regulation. We do not think that the existing professionals on our registers should pay for that, and the Government have always given us a grant to cover the costs of opening the register. That is at certain times slightly frustrating for the aspirant groups, because until we see the draft legislation it is not appropriate for us to put significant resources into that project. So we will participate. We will give our advice but we won’t start, for example, changing our IT systems. As soon as the Government makes the decision and publishes the draft legislation, we hit the go button.

I think one was in 1989 and the other in 1991 or 1992. They needed statutory regulation, which has made their bodies much more robust, and they have had a much better interface with doctors. One of the big issues was the huge bill that each practitioner had to pay each year.

The reason we can charge an £80 registration fee is that our register has 320,000 individuals. When we bring a new group into regulation in a sense you are coming into an organisation that is set up, so you don’t have to pay the start-up costs. The chiropractors and the osteopaths had to start with a blank bit of paper, which required them to put millions of pounds into the system to get it up and running.

In a sense, as health care evolves, regulation has to respond and make decisions based primarily on public safety and protection, and it must be driven by that. There are strong and opposing views about the nature of evidence, the credibility of evidence and the evidence base of different types of professional practice. I am not saying that witch doctors are necessarily on that spectrum, but there are certainly lots of highly contested views about the nature of evidence. We are aware of that, and to some extent that is an important driver, but it is not the primary driver for us on decisions about regulation, because the primary driver is public safety. All professions have gaps in their evidence base. I think that doctors would see that there are gaps in their evidence base, and the allied health professions would certainly say the same.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q51 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrew George:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> But is there not a risk, in relation to public protection, that by introducing a particular activity into statutory regulation, you are by implication suggesting that there is an evidential base to show that the activity is in some sense effective, when it might not be?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr van </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">der</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gaag</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> That is the debate.

Clearly, in some parts of the world and in some communities it absolutely is and in others, it is not. That is why we are back to the cliché of the devil is in the detail. I am not sure that the evidential base can be so pinned down and used as the key imperative in decision making. For me, that is why it comes back to public safety.

NICE has now approved acupuncture for lower back pain, which is to be welcomed, because a lot of people benefit from it. However, I have used acupuncture over the years for a whole range of other things, and I am sure it works. I have looked at Chinese studies that go back to some of the great Chinese philosophers. Have we not got to a ludicrous situation where we ignore the evidence of people getting better when they have a particular treatment? When we, as politicians, have people come to our surgeries, we have to make assessments of them, and it is perfectly possible to assess </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">whether something has worked without having a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Is it not important that we look at the evidence of what has happened to people, as well as insisting on these trials? We have got to a point where we are not using the available medical systems effectively because we have got so wrapped up in this concept of double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr van </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">der</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gaag</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Certainly, if you look at the really excellent work that the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Pittilo</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> working group did on this, there are different kinds of evidence across the range of interventions. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">May I come back to your really interesting, important point about what good fitness to practise looks like? We have done a lot of work on the operational side and have also engaged with registrants, the public, employers, educators and so on about the meaning of fitness to practise. Perhaps one of the things that is often missing is a shared understanding of what the fitness to practise process is there to do. Although, on the face of it, it seems very obvious, I think there is still work to be done by all of us in getting a shared understanding of what fitness to practise is there to do. It is not a complaints resolution process, for example, and it is not there to sort out people’s frustrations about hospital car parking fees. It has a very specific meaning in professional regulation: it is about whether somebody continues to meet certain standards of conduct and competence, and whether there is a finding of impairment against those standards.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Part of the process of improving efficiency and effectiveness in professional regulation is about getting that shared understanding so that people’s expectations of what they are coming into, whether as complainants or witnesses, are understood. That has been a big focus for us over the past few years, and I think it has been well received in the community that we operate in.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think it would be helpful if the note you are going to send us about the statistics could also say a bit about the approach you </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">take</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> to fitness to practise—perhaps enlarge a little on those thoughts—because it is one of the points of comparison between the work that you do and probably your most direct comparator in cost and numbers terms: the NMC.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Thank you very much for this interesting session.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="line-height:28pt; margin:14pt 0pt 9pt"><span style="color:#005232; font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman'; font-size:10pt">              </span><span style="color:#005232; font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman'; font-size:10pt">Oral evidence: Health and Care Professions Council</span><span style="color:#005232; font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman'; font-size:10pt">, HC </span><span style="color:#005232; font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman'; font-size:10pt">922</span><span style="color:#005232; font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman'; font-size:10pt">              </span><span style="color:#005232; font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman'; font-size:10pt">              </span><span style="color:#005232; font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman'; font-size:10pt">9</span></p></div><hr style="width:33%; height:1px; text-align:left" /><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn1"></a><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:10pt"> Note from the witness: The HCPC has supplied the following correction: 1065 doctors in 11 settings were involved in this work, and 30,000 patient questionnaires and 17,000 colleague questionnaires were used. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn2"></a><a href="#_ftnref2">[2]</a><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:10pt"> Note from the witness: The HCPC has supplied the following correction: the HCPC has 634 </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:10pt">partners.  </span></p></body></html>
