The costs of these continual major repairs that the Peak Park Rangers carry out with assistance from Derbyshire County Council are a drain on valuable resources. While Chelmorton Parish Council does not wish to see any of these activities stopped, we consider that some lanes need designating for specific activities and making other use unlawful. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">In this case as the track is part of both a National Bridleway and National Walking route, we would like to see the only motorised traffic allowed to use it be for essential farm use.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">We have raised this matter with the Peak Park and our County Councillor and understand that until legislation is changed then their hands are tied and they have to accommodate all, but with limited resources the track often becomes only usable by off-road vehicles for long periods.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">We therefore support measures that give the National Park or Highways Authorities the power to change the status of Green Lanes based on local conditions.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Yours faithfully</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Matthew Lovell</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Clerk to Chelmorton Parish Council</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">12</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:8pt; vertical-align:super">th</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> September 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
