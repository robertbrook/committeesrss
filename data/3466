font-size:12pt">Although I withdrew from the electrical trade in 2011,  I was an NICEIC Approved Contractor when the Part P Scheme was introduced in 2005.  Initially ( as evidenced by an article I published in the Observer </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">newspaper in January 2005) I welcomed the scheme as a probable solution to the problem of “cowboy” electricians.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';

font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">My contract was abruptly terminated by the NICEIC in June 2009, for reasons which I believe call into question their motivation</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> and priorities.  During my time as an Assessor I was aware of many examples from my own experience of the failure of the NICEIC to carry out the requirements of the scheme.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Most of these examples were reported by me to my supervisor or to the NICEIC  off</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';

font-size:12pt"> (the head of the NICEIC), pointing out their lamentable record, and received a reply which not only ignored most of the points I had raised, but gave in</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';

font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">a) The obvious flaw in the scheme is that the operators receive subscriptions from those they regulate.  As I have  always asked, would road safety improve if Driving Test Examiners got a bonus for each pass?  There is </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">a clear conflict of interest, and a corresponding temptation to go easy,  to “turn a blind eye”  during inspections, in order to keep up the numbers of enrolled contractors.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">b)  The raison </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">d'etre</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> for the scheme was the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">the</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> supposed high numbers of fatalit</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">ies and injuries caused by faulty electrical wiring.  I could find no evidence to support this. There are in fact very few deaths, most of which take place in industrial and commercial premises, which are not covered by Part P.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">House fires are caused by </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">misuse of equipment (</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">eg</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">. hanging wet clothes over electric heaters) or by</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">candles etc., rather than by fixed wiring.  Again, Part P only applies to fixed wiring.   Better design of appliances and increased public awareness of risk would be far more effecti</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">ve in saving lives.   In any case, it is generally known that house fires are often attributed to electrical faults, when no other cause can be found.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">c)  The fitting of an RCD (residual current device) to a domestic installation would go a long way to pr</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">eventing death or injury.  If it was required by law to fit an RCD, the work required to ensure its correct action in older installations would soon bring all house wiring up to a safe standard.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">d) The NICEIC, as the largest scheme operator, often failed </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">to carry out its stated function, and showed no interest in doing so even when its failing were pointed out; the chain can only be as strong as its weakest link.  The standard of inspection to ensure compliance among contractors was in my experience very l</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">ow.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">e)  The lack of enforcement of Part P, and indeed the impossibility of effective enforcement, lends weight to the idea that it should be scrapped, and that we return to the position prior to 2005.  It was and is an ill-considered and poorly-administer</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">ed scheme.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">f) In my view it is not possible to legislate for a sense of personal responsibility.  Electricians have this in common with surgeons, bus drivers and pilots; that their mistakes can kill! If that is not sufficient to bring them to an awarene</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">ss of their responsibility, then Part P will not.  Surely existing laws (such as the Health and Safety at Work Act) are enough to deal with unsafe work?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:right"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">7th.
