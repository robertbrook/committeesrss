My department was in many ways an excellent place to work, and my immediate colleagues were very supportive as well as successful. However, academia as a profession is, I believe, broken. There are a number of issues, particularly in science, that make it an unattractive option to women as well as many others. Many of the wider issues have been studied in depth, and I have included links to some relevant reports at the end of this evidence</span><a name="_ftnref2"></a><a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a><a name="_ftnref3"></a><a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a><a name="_ftnref4"></a><a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a><a name="_ftnref5"></a><a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. However, here I would like to tell you about my first-hand impressions and experiences, which hopefully will provide some insight as to why so many people, particularly women, don't think scientific research in universities is worth it.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="4" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.25pt; orphans:0; padding-left:4.75pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">There is a distinct lack of job security at start of a scientific research career. Having graduated with a PhD, typically around your mid-twenties, you as an early career researcher (ECR) can expect to remain on short-term contracts for many years, typically some five to ten in my experience. These contracts can last anywhere from a few months to a few years (or even effectively a rolling monthly contract in one friend's case), with a strong expectation that you will move around the country, if not the world. Often you have to put life on hold for months or more while waiting for funding news, something that may not be sustainable if you want a real life, a house, children and so on, particularly if your partner (should you have one) is unable support you. Things are even more precarious as an older PhD student: despite often effectively doing the equivalent work of a postdoc, particularly in the latter half of their courses, PhD students are not employees and hence have no associated rights, such as the right to paid maternity leave. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="5" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.25pt; orphans:0; padding-left:4.75pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Many of us have suffered from the so-called “two-body problem”: the difficulty for couples in STEM, particularly in academia, in finding jobs a reasonable commuting distance apart. In my case, my partner has stable, permanent job he very much enjoys, located some distance away from Southampton. This situation meant choosing between living apart until some undetermined time in the future when a job came up at a nearby university, convincing him to risk his own career to follow me around the country (or world!) with no guarantee that I'd eventually succeed, or leaving academia myself. Ultimately, I made the latter choice. I feel that there can be more subtle pressure on women to accommodate men in such situations: doing so is perhaps more socially acceptable and quite possibly more practical if child-bearing is, or will be, an issue. Short-term contracts coinciding with child-bearing years can obviously be more of a disadvantage to female postdocs, especially if they have a partner also working in academia, who feels equally unable to spend a significant period away from work. As someone who's open to the idea of children in future, this felt to me like an unpleasant choice: risk not having children or risk having to restart my career in my mid-thirties. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="6" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.25pt; orphans:0; padding-left:4.75pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">And the impression is that it is extremely difficult, at least in science, to leave and return. In order to succeed, it is necessary to maintain a high publication rate, necessary to keep up with the literature (this is especially difficult given most journals/proceedings are paywalled) and necessary to appear “fully committed”. Although contracts themselves are short-term, much of the associated bureaucracy requires long-term planning. Journal articles can take many months to produce. Conferences, attendance of which is vital to develop your profile as well as keep up-to-date with scientific developments, are generally applied for around half a year in advance, while funding grants are generally applied for months if not years in advance. It is crucial therefore to remain actively researching and “in the loop”. Part-time working at the early career stage is non-existent in my experience.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="7" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.25pt; orphans:0; padding-left:4.75pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">This need to be “in the loop” stems in part from the absolute importance of maintaining a good relationship with your supervising professor. The importance of this relationship cannot be overstated or overestimated. You rely on them to apply for grants on your behalf, to give you money from existing grants, to support you in for example fellowship applications, and to recommend you to colleagues. It can hence be difficult to stand up for yourself if your supervisor demands long hours, early or late meetings, extra responsibilities, frequent foreign travel and so on. It should be noted that official employment rights are not the issue: if professors are allowed to set their groups' working patterns and those patterns are never challenged, it is not worth arguing; indeed, complaining is counter-productive as you may be damaging your future prospects. One should also bear in mind that many members of a group will likely be PhD students, who as mentioned above are not employees and hence are not subject to employment law (and based on my experiences of student unions, have very little representation or collective bargaining power). Although I was fortunate to have a very good relationship with my professor, not everyone is so lucky, and I have seen several women leave academia at least in part due to poor relationships with their supervisors. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="8" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.25pt; orphans:0; padding-left:4.75pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Similarly, without maintaining a good relationship with your professor, jobs can be hard (or even harder!) to come by. The fixed-, often short-term nature of funding and the need to maintain a high publishing rate (for example for the REF) leads to professors often preferring to employ “the devil they know”, or at least people with an extremely specific current skill set, so that they can start being productive as quickly as possible. A Vitae study in 2010 showed, for example, that nearly 70% of PhD graduates working in HE research found their job either via professional contacts or because they had already worked in an institution</span><a name="_ftnref6"></a><a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> While this may be beneficial for existing group members or collaborators needing a job (I will</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> readily admit that I took </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">advantage of such a situation), it can </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">exacerbate other fundamental problems, including the over-reliance on supervisor relationships. It can also be a bar to changing fields, as a need for on-the-job training in a particular technique can be seen as a rea</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">son not to employ someone who is otherwise very capable: this is something that has frustrated both myself and, prior to his leaving academia, my partner.

U</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">nfortunately, this seems to incl</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">ude a high proportion of women. Speaking for myself, the lack of other women, particularly women in permanent and senior positions who can act as role models, can be demoralising. There is pressure on high-achieving women to act as role models, which, whil</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">e sometimes flattering, can lead to additional unwanted stress: it is not pleasant feeling like you're representing all women all of the time.

Because they are fed by wider societal issues, however</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, many academia-specific issues are seen as “somebody else's problem”, and hence not something individual university departments can influence even if the will </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">to change things </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">is there.
