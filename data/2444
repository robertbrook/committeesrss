He had complained that he had not been subject to regular reviews, denied being an escape threat and said such information had been supplied by a patient at the mental health unit who disliked him.

Last year 10% more cases were deemed eligible. 4% more cases were started but 5% less completed. 53% were finished within their target 12 weeks compared to 63% the previous year. Last year there was no increase in complaints whereas the year before there was a 14% increase.
