This comment will focus on the implications of the Asia-Pacific dimension for the UK.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 8pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">Since </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">the end of the Second World War</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt"> US policy in Asia has been conditioned by a paramount concern over the intentions of China</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">.  This concern was built upon a longstanding ‘love-hate’ relationship between the US and China which could be seen as going back to the middle of the Nineteenth Century, rooted initially in extensive US missionary activity there, and later in a frustrated desire to educate the Chinese for democracy.  Related issues after 1945 were the security of American-occupied Japan, and the fate of Taiwan.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 8pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">In some ways, therefore, the ‘pivot to Asia’ policy is not new; nor is the focus on China.  The US became involved in the Korean War because of the perceived threat from the Communist bloc, represented by China.  For similar reasons the US took up the mantle in Viet Nam in the wake of the failure of the French at </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">Dienbienphu</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt"> in 1954.  The policy of isolation and containment of China, first conceived during the McCarthy period of the early 1950s, saw a ring of US bases around China in South Korea, Japan, Guam, South Viet Nam, the Philippines and elsewhere, and a hiatus in full American diplomatic relations with China until 1979.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 8pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">The legacy of all of this has been a profound distrust of US intentions among Chinese policy-makers, which sits uncomfortably with the Chinese desire for trade with and technology transfer from what is perceived to be the world’s most advanced nation.  Although the US ‘pivot to Asia’ is said to involve,</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial;

that the Chinese Communists were originally above all nationalists, or patriots (the Communist Party in fact appealed for US support and recognition in the closing stages of the civil war); that the Vietnamese had a long history of conflict with the Chinese, and that it was American support of the South that pushed them to-</span><span style="font-family:Arial;
