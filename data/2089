The Government’s stated aim at the time of the 2000 Act was to provide assistance to bring about completion of the definitive map and statement (the local authority's legal record of public rights of way) by the cut-off date.

It is a coherent blueprint for reforms that will deliver real benefit to all involved – land managers and businesses, users, and local authorities. Moving away from the convoluted and adversarial style of the current regime, and towards a simpler set of processes with more room for local negotiation, has been a key driver behind the Group’s thinking.  As the report makes clear, the Group feels strongly that the changes it advocates are a cohesive package. Any partial implementation of its recommendations would unbalance the position, and damage the consensus behind the proposals.
