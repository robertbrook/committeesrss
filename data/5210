In relation to the questions that you and your committee raise I can confirm that I have set one target for the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police which is to reduce crime at a greater rate than the national average. This supports my vision of making South Yorkshire the safest place to live, learn, work and run businesses. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">The target reflects the fact that South Yorkshire Police are a national outlier in respect of all crime per 1,000 population and seeks to converge this gap. This target is aimed at being flexible and non-prescriptive about how South Yorkshire Police deliver on this. It is designed to reflect changes in national crime levels therefore in practice the target should always reflect the current offence patterns and national trends, meaning the target is challenging but achievable. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">The force have been allowed to respond internally to the target as they wish, I have had no involvement in setting any other crime statistics targets around recorded crime areas, I have set priorities for the force around reducing all crime and ASB, protecting vulnerable people and increasing visibility, as detailed in my Police and Crime Plan. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">In terms of assurance around the accuracy of statistics I rely on a number of indicators and bodies; HMIC being a key one of those and their inspections around crime data integrity but also the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) and internal force arrangements. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">As pointed out in the crime statistics review by </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">Jil</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt"> Matheson, the two main sources of crime statistics Police Recorded Crime (PRC) and CSEW, complement each other and deliver a range of information that cannot be provided by one source alone. The CSEW for example, can reflect crime that may have not been reported to the Police as it surveys directly with members of the public; when looking at the results over recent years those two sources have reported broadly similar trends, which indicates a degree of trust can be placed in recorded crime reductions. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">In terms of internal force arrangements, I can report that the Designated Decision Maker (DDM) as referred to in the Home Office Counting Rules (HOCR) is there to provide an independent and objective view of collated evidence. They ensure basic principles for outcomes and No crimes as per HOCR are compliant. In order for an individual to commence the role of DDM, they must undertake an awareness session on their role as per HOCR and a review of their decisions is carried out by the audit team and feedback provided. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">The force has regular DDM meetings where crime recording is discussed this ensures a corporate and compliant approach to crime recording and it promotes greater consistency within the force. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">The crime system which is an in-house bespoke system has inbuilt validations to ensure accurate recording and live time checking is undertaken by exception reporting, using a query tool to retrieve data from the crime system for review. The live time checking is undertaken in order to ensure offences are classified correctly as per HOCR before submission of any Annual Data Return (ADR) to the Home Office. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">Within South Yorkshire Police, an audit team, which is managed by the force’s crime and incident registrar, carries out a schedule of HOCR, National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">) and thematic audits to identify risks to the force in recording and detecting practices and assist in the development of policies and working practices. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">The DDM’s in the force are considered the local champions for crime and help to maintain application of HOCR including NCRS at a Basic Command Unit Level (BCU). </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">Districts are held to account via performance and governance meetings conducted by the Deputy Chief Constable from whom I receive regular performance reports at my regular Governance Advisory Board. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11.5pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">I trust that this answers the questions raised in your initial letter.</span></p><p style="font-size:11.5pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11.5pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt; font-style:italic">January 2014</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
