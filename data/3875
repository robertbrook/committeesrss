The rule of law being fundamental to human rights, the proposals on ‘no difference’ procedural defects are of concern for seeking to curtail judicial constraint of unlawful, unfair and op</span><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:11pt">aque procedures on the basis that the unlawfulness, unfairness or opacity did not make a difference.
