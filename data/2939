It offers the scope to create larger areas of habitat that are more resilient, better protected and more accessible. So in principle we believe biodiversity offsetting has potential to be a useful addition to the planning system, as part of a triple bottom line approach to achieving sustainable development. </span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 15.01pt; padding-left:20.99pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">However, there are many ‘ifs’ and ‘buts’, and we are very aware that if a scheme is not carefully designed and rigorously implemented offsetting could exacerbate losses of biodiversity.

In this scenario, many LNPs would need to ‘raise their game’ and ensure they have sufficient capacity and draw on appropriate. Expertise.
