font-size:12pt"> During our last inquiry into housing costs, when we were looking at the local housing allowance and its implementation, Government Ministers said that the effect of the cap on LHA would effectively mean that landlords would reduce their rents.  Now, I understand from your own research, Mr Joyce, that that has not happened; the rents have not actually fallen.  </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Is it just too soon for that to have happened—for that kind of effect to have taken place—or do you think that it is unlikely that the caps on LHA are going to reduce rents?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert Joyce</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The fact that we have not initially seen much impact on rents does not really tell us much about the long-run impact necessarily.  It would not be surprising if this reform ultimately does have an impact on rents, but I cannot predict whether it will or not.  There are reasons why we might expect any impact to be lagged, and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">we see evidence of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">some of those</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, such as limited </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">awareness of reforms from claimants</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">our consortium partners, in the evaluation done for the Department for Work and Pensions, did a survey, and their survey suggested that the majority of claim</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">ant</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">s initially were not aware that the scheme had changed, even just after it had actually started to affect them.  That might be one reason why it is taking longer to see rents being renegotiated and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">for </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">impacts to feed through.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond;

You might think that is the first step </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">before </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">rents </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">that already landlords are informally just accepting lower rents without changing the contractual rents.  In a sense, there may be some real effects there, but they are not </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">captured</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> if you just look at the contractual rents that are recorded in the administrative data.  Presumably, eventually, that will feed through into formal rent.  I cannot predict what is going to happen to rents in the future, but it would not be surprising if they fell, even though they have not initially.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert Joyce</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The main determinant of what will happen to rents is the relative supply and demand, and the level of responsiveness of supply and demand to rent levels.  Some of the academic literature that has looked at what happens to rent levels when you change rent subsidies has tended to find that a lot of the effect of rent subsidies is to change rents, and that is because they find that supply tends to be relatively unresponsive.  That might be one reason why you would ultimately expect to see impacts on rent.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, and urban areas outside of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert Joyce</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Again, looking at the qualitative research that our consortium partners did in the interim report as part of the evaluation of this, one thing that came up was that housing advisers suggested that landlords who take LHA tenants tended to place more stringent requirements on them in terms of things like more rent in advance, larger deposits, perhaps seeing them as riskier prospects and responding to that.  There is also some evidence that in some areas, particularly in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, landlords were looking to replace LHA tenants with non</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">­</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert Joyce</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There has always been some segmentation in the market between some landlords who prefer not to take LHA tenants or housing benefit tenants, and some who do not mind.  I cannot say with any confidence whether that has particularly changed in response to the reforms.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt"> Obviously, we are in a world now where </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">benefits</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> will be rated by CPI, not by actual local rent increases.  I guess it is too early to say on that, but do you see that having an impact on this market as well, driving on the behaviour that we are just starting to see?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert Joyce</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Certainly, eventually, it is going to have a big impact.  Obviously,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> there is </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">a change to indexation, and the impact of that will tend to grow every year into the future, assuming that real rents continue to grow, so that CPI inflation is lower than what LHA rates would otherwise have gone up by.  In time, I think this will be a major, major reform, and it should be taken very seriously.  In terms of the impacts, it would be useful to break that down into two components.  One is just the fact that it is generally going to mean that housing benefit rises less quickly than it would otherwise have done, and it will generally mean that it will cover a lower share of people’s housing costs over time, assuming that rents continue to grow in real terms.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">You can think of it just like most cuts to housing benefit; the general impact of cuts to housing benefit will apply.  It will tend to mean that people may spend less on housing, as they now face more of the additional cost of choosing to live in more expensive housing.  It may mean they work more, either because there is an income effect</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—they have a shortfall now that they need to plug—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">or because reducing housing benefit tends to strengthen work incentives, in the sense that you have less to lose when you enter work, as there is less housing benefit you are getting.  They might also buy less of other things.  The general impact of a big cut to housing benefit will apply, but there is also the fact that it means that there will be a difference between areas where rents grow quickly and where rents grow slowly in the future, because that will no longer be reflected in what happens to housing benefit entitlements in different areas, and other components.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Over time, after 2012-13</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> you would expect people to liv</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt"> and more in areas where rents grow slowly.  Initially, the impacts are going to be small, but </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">given the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">change to indexation, they will grow and grow over time.  It is going to be a major reform.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Nigel Mills:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> How much evidence was there that it was the level of housing benefit that was driving up rents, rather than the other way around, with the market dragging housing benefit up?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert Joyce</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There is certainly some evidence that, if you look at the distribution of rents in a particular area, there is a spike in the number of rents</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">are basically around the LHA rate, so it is evidence that landlords do use that as a benchmark.  There is some evidence that there is some causal effect going from LHA rates to rent levels.  Clearly, it is not the only thing that affects rent levels.  We probably would expect rent levels to continue to grow in real terms, regardless of what the uprating of housing benefit is.  We can still fairly confidently </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">expect that the reform will result in LHA covering a smaller proportion of rents than it would otherwise have done.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Fitzpatrick</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The shared accommodation rate has been extended to single, childless people under 35.  There are very limited exceptions to that.  There was an exception introduced for people who have spent at least three months in a hostel, and also for offenders who pose a significant risk to the public, but those are very restricted, very narrow exceptions.  That means that in shared accommodation</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt"> At the time of the changes to LHA, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">there</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> was a debate around what proportion of the private rented sector was also covered by housing benefit—in other words, what proportion of the private rented sector was people receiving housing benefit.  The argument appeared to be that it was a sufficiently large proportion to drive changes in rents.  I wondered if there was any clearer information now about what the proportion is.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert Joyce</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I do not have anything precise.  I would have thought it was not too difficult to get a reasonable handle on that.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Wilcox:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The reason why there were issues about it is that, in a sense, the data on benefit numbers becomes available very quickly, and the data on the numbers of dwellings in which there is tenure becomes available much more slowly, as a result of surveys and so forth.  Obviously, with the census, we have now got very robust data for 2011.  On one set of projections, I think, the Government had thought that something close to 40% of the market was covered by people on housing benefit.  From memory</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—I had not seen those figures before today—the outturn</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> figures were closer to about 35% than 40%.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Perhaps the key point is that you have very strong variation in that from locality to locality.  It is not just regional; it is very much about local housing markets.  We were part of the team that did the initial evaluation of the LHA for the Department, and one of the things that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">came out is that you had variations between areas like Teignbridge in south Devon—where the private rented sector claimants represented only about 8% of the local market, and so were relatively insignificant—and elsewhere.  In Teignbridge, there was a high level of demand</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> from </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">other claimant groups for the properties in that area.  There are other areas</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Blackpool and north-east Lincolnshire come to mind</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—where the proportion of housing benefit claimants represented closer to four</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">fifths of the</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> total housing benefit market.  Quite clearly, in those different market situations, you would anticipate a different likely impact of trying to change the LHA rules.  In what you might call the benefit-dominated markets, you would expect to see more of a change, but in the markets where housing benefit is relatively insignificant, it would not be surprising that you see something like the near-to-zero impact that has been suggested.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert Joyce</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Just to add to that, in the initial evaluation of the LHA changes, we did look at what happens if you split areas according to an estimate of the share of LHA recipients in the private rental market in each local authority; we had to do an approximation, for most of the reasons that Steve outlined.  There, we found that you do not really see any effect on rents, either in the bottom or top quintile of local authorities </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">listed according to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">density of LHA claimants.  The zero was zero across the board.  Clearly, if and when effects on rents do start to materialise, we may expect that to happen more in areas where LHA claimants make up a larger proportion of the market than in areas where they do not, although that will also depend on how segmented these markets are.  There are some landlords</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Fitzpatrick</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The suggestion that youth homelessness is rising is not particularly based on the statutory homelessness figures</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—people coming forward to local authorities—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">although, as Committee members may know, we had quite a long-term decline in the overall numbers of statutory homeless for seven or eight years under the prevention policies that were introduced by the last Administration.  Since 2010, the overall numbers of statutory homelessness applications and acceptances have been rising.  There has been some increase among young people, as </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">other groups, but only since 2010.  My main source for that is data derived from the analysis we do</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> for the homelessness monitor</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and asks people their experience of homelessness.  It suggests a) that the experience of homelessness is very heavily concentrated among 16 to 25 year olds, and b) </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">the incidence of it has been rising over time.  That is nothing to do with people applying as homeless to local authorities; it is asking people in surveys whether they have experienced a range of homeless situations.  That evidence is quite independent of any of these incentive issues that you outlined.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">On the incentive issues, clearly there has always been a big debate around the homelessness provisions, and it is difficult to deny that if people are given some sort of priority in social housing allocations</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, particularly in the areas of</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> highest demand</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, then </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">there is some incentive in the system for people to place themselves in that position.  However, an incentive being there in principle or in theory is not the same as it being acted on in practice, and the evidence of young people or other age groups acting on the incentive to put themselves through the homelessness system is actually extremely slight.  I did a very large survey when I was at the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">University</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">York</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> some years ago, paid for by the Department for Communities and Local Government.  It was a major survey of homeless 16 and 17</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.  In one sense, they are designed to have a particular impact in London, but they are very much at odds with the duties on local authorities, particularly in terms of homelessness, and so it is difficult to see how local authorities continue to be able to meet those duties, even with moves to move temporary accommodation households some considerable distance from London.  There comes a point where you have to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt"> than there is in markets in other parts of the country, and there is the issue that Suzanne has alluded to.  When we look at the way market pressures operate in the private rented sector, housing, essentially, is rationed by price and household income.  In the social rented sector, we have a waiting-list system that is based on a variety of criteria, but where the main form of rationing is actually in terms of waiting time.  That varies.  In the areas with a very high demand, you will wait much longer on the waiting list than the areas of low demand.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The homeless legislation actually has a completely uniform structure, and it has a uniform set of rules about local connection and whether people should be re-housed in a particular area, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">ness</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> legislation, the way they are assisted could be structured in a different way and not necessarily fall to be dealt with by the particularly high</span><span style="font-family:Arial;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In terms of the issue about allocation to social tenants, social housing is essentially allocated, rather than selected in the market in the way it is in the private rented sector.  However, it is often a negotiated process</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">different applicants might have a higher degree of priority and therefore a greater choice or influence over the accommodation they are allocated than other households.  They are not in full control of what they are allocated, but the degree of influence varies from area to area.  Equally, the demand for transfers and the pressures on stock will vary from one part of the country to another.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Obviously the critical issue around the bedroom limits is about what capacity there is, in appropriate cases, for households to be able to secure smaller accommodation.  There are some landlords—and these more typically tend to be those around </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and the South</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">East—who have a mix of sizes of dwellings within their supply of stock, and they have a strong demand from new applicants, very often homeless families, for larger accommodation.  If they can facilitate a downsizing transfer, then that is a win-win situation.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">A lot of landlords are struggling with quite how they prioritise downsizing-transfer cases in the light of the new bedroom-limit rules, so it does not always work as smoothly as you might think.  That is, if you like, the smoother end of the spectrum.  The other end of the spectrum is the landlords who have very little smaller accommodation, and where levels of what is deemed to be under-occupation are quite widespread.  That is partly because of a structural mismatch between the distribution of the stock and the demand they have from households.  Also, particularly once you move out of the more pressured areas of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, one of the wider issues is that the bedroom standard, as we know it, does not actually fit with wider social notions of how much accommodation people need.  There were surveys decades ago trying to look at what was deemed to be under-occupation.  The vast majority of households who were deemed to be under-occupied did not recognise themselves as being under-occupied.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The bedroom standard was based on pre-</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">w</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">environmental health standards.  Since then, social standard</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">s have risen enormously. Three </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">quarters of all households in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Britain</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">live in accommodation with more than the bedroom standard, and the social norm now is the bedroom standard plus one. Back in the days </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">when </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">the bedroom standard was first evolved as an idea, the bedroom standard was more the norm. Social standards have changed, so it is a very tight rule that people do not recognise. Particularly once you move outside of pressured housing markets, there is a more relaxed approach to allocation, which fits with this mismatch of stock.  Landlords have not been obliged to try to come up with a much tighter fit on stock by the benefit rules for the last 50 years, so this is a very major change.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">One can see the principles, and in fact one can almost think it is rather an anomaly that there was never some kind of bedroom limit within the social sector housing benefit system over all the years it has existed.  On the other hand, trying to introduce it at one moment in time in areas where you have this mismatch, and in areas where there is not necessarily the high level of demand from other applicants for that larger accommodation, makes it a classic example of one of those policies that might work very well in one part of the country but not necessarily in others.     </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">kind assistance, rather than cash assistance.  That in-kind assistance includes second</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">hand-furniture projects and so on.  There is an increasing reliance on food banks, to a very great extent, and there is less and less provision of things like rent in advance and rent deposit schemes, which crisis loans were used for.  There are quite serious implications in terms of homelessness, particularly in those areas where we are trying to encourage people to use the private rented sector, rather </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">assistance is highly rationed.  They might only be able to use food banks three times a year, for example.  These are the sorts of things that we have been hearing.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">cost contribution would only be a partial contribution, because of the element in the baseline welfare system.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That kind of route, which would actually make the whole process of managing help with housing costs a heck of a lot easier—you do not have so many perverse incentives you are trying to deal with all the time—does mean going down the route of increasing levels of underlying welfare and insurance benefits.  That is never easy, and can never be done quickly.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">assuming it goes ahead at some point appropriately</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">it would have been possible to bring assistance with mortgage costs into that scheme, rather than keeping it outside of the scheme, as now proposed.  There has been resistance in the past to the idea of providing help with mortgage costs, particularly where it relates to people in low-paid work, because that would be an additional bill that the Exchequer is not currently facing.  However, it would be a logical fit to have the same rules for benefits and help with housing costs, whether you are in low-paid work or out of work, applying to home</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">-</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">owners </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">tenants.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">You have seen the Government’s evidence to you.  They are saying that in the longer term their view is that they will look at treating the payments for mortgage costs as a recoverable loan, rather than a one-off payment.  Once you have taken that decision and are going down that road, you are not actually incurring costs going forward.  It is a loan arrangement, not a grant arrangement, so the reasons for keeping the scheme separate and causing difficulties around people in transition, moving into small parts of work before they move into longer-term employment and so on, could have been removed.  That is something that might be very well worth asking the Government to reconsider, because they have not taken their final decisions on how they deal with that, but there is an opportunity there to bring treatment </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">mortgage costs in alignment with treatment of other rental costs.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Fitzpatrick</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There is a point to make at a very high level, and then maybe a couple of much more specific points.  The main reason why the housing-benefit bill became so large is because of the under</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">-</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">supply of housing for people on low incomes.  One obvious solution therefore, going back to a conversation we were having earlier, is to considerably up the supply of social housing.  That would ease the pressure on the private rented sector and rents in that sector as well.  Of course, we are relying increasingly on the private rented sector.  It is now bigger in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> than the social rented sector.  It is increasingly accommodating low-income groups who are relying on benefit at a point when market rents are rising strongly, so clearly you have a rising housing</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">benefit bill.  The underlying issue here is housing supply, which is a very big one but there is no getting away from it; it is driving up the cost.  You asked about making it cheaper.  I think we do have to reiterate that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">On a much more detailed level, I want to make a point on the bedroom limits.  Steve was saying that, whether or not we accept the basis of the policy—many people, of course, do not—there is a range of ways in which you can ameliorate the impacts of something like bedroom limits.  In the homelessness monitor this year, people in the north, the midlands, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, Wales and so on, are saying, “This is the overwhelming welfare issue for us.  It is much more important than any other benefit cuts that are going on.”  That is particularly local authorities and social</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">sector landlords, but it is not only them.  The voluntary-sector agencies are also saying, “Bedroom limits are a really big issue for us”.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Even if the policy stays</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">it looks like it is going to</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">there are ways to ameliorate its impact.  Steve said one of the things we can do is codify the people.  What are the patterns in the people who are receiving DHPs, and the people receiving DHPs in relation to something that is a long-term enduring issue?  We could see whether we can develop some sensible, rational exemptions to the policy based around that.  Clearly there are parts of the country where it is very difficult for people to move, but there are also specific groups—disabled people; women fleeing violence, with sanctuary rooms put into their properties; other groups who, for health or other reasons, need extra bedrooms—where perhaps we can look at expanding the exemptions to make the policy not quite as overwhelming in its impact as at the moment, even if the underlying principle remains.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert Joyce</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Following on a little bit from what Steve was saying about putting more things in universal credit, I know we are not talking about council tax support specifically, but there is a very strong case for having council tax support within universal credit.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We have made that case ourselves.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert Joyce</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Having them separate creates very difficult issues around how they interact with each other.  It risks undermining some of the main points of universal credit, like ensuring that work incentives cannot get too weak when multiple benefits are withdrawn over the same range of income. That is very problematic, and I think there is a very strong case for putting it in universal credit.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Another specific thing that we mentioned at the start, which really is a very, very big reform in the long run, is the change to indexation of local housing allowance rates to CPI.  This is a major thing.  In the long run you are breaking the link between rents and support for rents, so in a sense you are really losing anything that has meaning for your housing benefit.  In quite a real sense, you are going to be having a benefit that is just for private sector renters, but it bears no relation to what housing costs are.  That is quite a big decision to make, and I do not think that is a debate that has been had, perhaps because it is not so clear that that is what is </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">going to happen.  However, that will be the long-run implication of just uprating housing benefit in line with prices and not in line with anything to do with housing costs.  That is a very a major decision to have taken, and I think it is slightly odd.  It is also going to create very, very arbitrary geographical variation in local housing allowance rates.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In 2050, one area could have a higher housing benefit entitlement than another simply because it had higher rates back in 2012, even if rents now are actually lower in that area than in another area.  That is just utterly arbitrary.  There is no reason why any Government should want a system like that.  I think that is a policy that will have a very big effect in the long run, and is probably important to reconsider sooner rather than later, because the longer you leave it, the harder it is to return to a more rational system, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">as </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">the disruption it will cause will be bigger.  Those are the two specific things I would suggest.    </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;
