We have therefore welcomed the proposed extension of rehabilitation services to offenders on short term sentences (less than 12 months). Re-offending rates by prisoners on short term sentences costs the criminal justice system a disproportionate amount. It also has a significant effect on local communities and local perception of crime. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">We have also cautiously supported the government’s commitment to designate new local resettlement prisons, so that local areas are better able to work with prisons, and the National Probation Service or other probation providers to commission rehabilitation and resettlement services.  We have however, asked government for reassurance that these reforms are achievable in London, given the particular pressures on prison spaces in London.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">We are concerned about the intention to commission probation services at the national level.

These can lead to inadequate performance from providers looking to minimise costs. There is already clear evidence from the Work Programme that commissioning these types of services from the market, when applied on a large scale and managed nationally, can lead to low levels of effectiveness. Indeed, introducing new providers of offender management, who have little incentive to co-ordinate with local provision,  has the potential to negatively affect existing local partnerships that have often years to build, where local probation trusts currently play a key role. It may also jeopardise local efforts to better align service delivery. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">In addition, we have concerns that the model of national commissioning with large contract package areas may have the effect of narrowing the market of providers, with only large providers being able to compete for contracts. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">We would therefore suggest the government consider the following to ensure that commissioned rehabilitation services be best aligned with local priorities</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">The value of local knowledge and expertise </span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">London boroughs have a critical role to play in supporting Ministry of Justice work within its commissioning strategy to deliver the best outcomes for offenders. </span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Working with offenders facing multiple barriers is essentially a local activity</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">.

There was evidence from those pilots that this approach was seeing some success.

It is difficult for to see how a payment by result model can respond effectively to that complexity.  For example despite the Government’s finessing of their financial model for these reforms there is still a perverse incentive for providers to game the system, using creaming and parking. The Government need to ensure that providers do not just work with those offenders that have less complex needs.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">In addition, there are concerns that PbR model where it is successful encourages these savings to be paid out in profits to providers, rather than reinvested into early intervention There is a real risk that new providers will lack the incentive to either provide initial upfront investment or reinvestment of their resources into early stage interventions, given that their profit-margins and payment mechanism is built on rehabilitating individuals already convicted of a crime. A recent report by the Social Market Foundation suggested that the PbR model being proposed by the Ministry of Justice risks “backfiring because their proposals mean that private and third sector organisations are in danger of losing money if they try to cut re-offending”. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">In contrast, the Community Budget pilots, as well as other local areas, are prioritising intervention earlier and further upstream in those who, potentially have the highest need and may ultimately be of high cost to the public purse.
