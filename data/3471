Mr Prosser, at Moreton-on-Lugg, the Office of Rail Regulation authorised a lower standard of safety work and, following that, Jane Harding was killed in January</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">2010. Because the ORR had authorised the work that was done, it was not able to prosecute Network Rail; however, the British Transport Police and the CPS did, and as a result Network Rail were fined £450,000. Do you think that incident demonstrates the conflict that the ORR has between economic regulation and safety regulation?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Ian Prosser</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: I would like to answer that in two parts, if I may. First, our thoughts are with the family of Jane Harding and others affected by her tragic accident. ORR did not approve the removal of the approach locking in the scope of the project. This project was done by Network Rail, and we did not approve it. It is a good example of the need for good, strong risk assessment at each and every crossing when you are doing a renewals project.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">On the second point, I do not believe there is any tension between the economic and safety aspects of ORR’s role. In fact, there are some very good examples where the role adds value in being both the economic and the safety regulator. For example, asset management is very crucial to both asset safety and asset performance, so from both aspects we are interested in the performance of the assets. Also, during the final and draft determinations for the next control period of the next five years, we have been able to evaluate the proposals to improve safety at level crossings and, with the support of Ministers, have earmarked £109</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">million for closures and improvements—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q82 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Mr Prosser, I am going on to that next, but I want to stop at the point when you said that you had not approved this. The RAIB report into the accident and the dea</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">th of Jane Harding stated that </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Network Rail proposed a partial renewal of level crossing protection, on cost grounds</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> and that </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">ORR’s consent to Network Rail’s request meant that formal consideration was not given to approach locking, which would have prevented that particular fatal accident, so what you have said is not quite right, is it? The RAIB report said something different; it said that you were involved in approving what Network Rail wanted to do.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Ian Prosser</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: There were some meetings between Network Rail and ORR, and the evidence of one of ORR’s signalling engineers to the actual prosecution. It is also the fact that we investigated that incident jointly with the BTP, and it was a matter of—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q83 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> I am not talking about your investigation of the incident. My concern is that you gave approval to Network Rail to do something that subsequently was found to be wrong and inadequate, and in fact led to the death of somebody on that line. Now you are telling me that you were not involved, but the RAIB report said that the ORR was. Are you disputing the RAIB report?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Ian Prosser</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: No. A meeting took place between Network Rail and ORR, but it did not specifically go through the design details of that particular crossing.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q84 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Did you dispute the RAIB report at the time it was made?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Ian Prosser</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: The RAIB make their reports, which are their views.

We believe we can reduce red tape, improve the way in which closures can happen and make it easier for the regulation of safety at level crossings.

As I said at the beginning, we can collectively do better—the industry and ourselves—in terms of improving. I think of three Es that are quite important for safety at level crossings: education, both for those who use them and those who manage them; enforcement, which is an important tool; and engineering, to take out some of the risks in a reasonable way through engineering controls. That also includes the highest level of control, which is to remove the crossing completely. That is why we supported Network Rail in removing 750 crossings in the last five years, and we will see a large number—over 500—removed in the next five years. That is the safest way to deal with level crossing risk.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q107 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Karl McCartney:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Mr Prosser, do you think that as an organisation you are proactive or reactive?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Ian Prosser</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: As an organisation, in the last five years, since I have been in this role, we have increased the amount of time inspectors spend on proactive inspection from about 30% to 35% to 50%, so I believe we are very proactive in inspecting and auditing our duty holders, not just Network Rail but all the other duty holders across the industry, which includes light rail, London Underground and trams.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q108 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Karl McCartney:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> You claim that you are proactive rather than reactive.

One was leadership, so that there was central leadership of the direction in which to take level crossing risk management. The second was risk assessment itself and the data that go into risk </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">assessments—the data are absolutely crucial to getting accurate and sufficient risk assessments. The third one was ownership at local level: they had various people involved with level crossings, in different departments and so on; they have now changed that, and it is starting to embed—let’s get local ownership and collaboration. One very important thing in level crossings is collaboration with train operating companies, because train drivers see what goes on on the railways. They have done some really good initiatives with train operating companies to get better data and information.

The way the risk assessment should take place consists of two things: one is an algorithm, which is a prescribed procedure, and the other is taking account of local factors—those are two things that a risk assessor must do. We found some deficiencies in the algorithm, which is being worked on by RSSB; they are doing research to improve the algorithm. The second is that the person who goes to do the risk assessment must look around his or her environment and take account of the peculiarities of that site. We found that in the past certain things that should have been taken into account were not. This is one of the reasons Network Rail now has level crossing managers, in the hope that they will build the competence and confidence to be able to be more tuned into the local factors that will make a difference to the risks.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q119 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Who is lacking in competence in this situation?

We felt that, subject to those improvements being made, the crossing could be made to operate at an acceptable level of risk. We did not see that that crossing was a priority for closure. Obviously, there would be a fairly serious outcome if, for all the crossings we went to, we took the ultimate sanction of recommending closure. We would have many recommendations for closure. We recognise that clearly there have to be priorities. We did not say, “Don’t close it,” but we felt that it could be brought back to a reasonable level of risk by the recommendations we made.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q123 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> In the accident there, Mrs Jeanette Nicholls was killed and the crossing was subsequently closed because of the coroner’s instruction.

We believed there were deficiencies at that crossing that would have to be addressed. At Mexico, one of the deficiencies was the audibility of the whistle board—it blows when the train is on approach. Audibility was not reliable and we made recommendations that, since that crossing was reliant on an audible warning, the audible warning had to be reliable of course, and therefore Network Rail should look at alternatives. Indeed, at other crossings they are looking at sounding the warning at the crossing, as opposed to the whistle board further up the line.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q124 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> I want to ask you about recommendations you made about lighting that appear to be contradictory. You looked at two separate fatal accidents at the Bayles and Wylies crossing in Nottingham. In November 2009, you recommended that pedestrian lighting be improved. In September 2013, you reported that the lighting was too bright and may have caused glare. Can you explain why you have these two apparently contradictory recommendations?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Carolyn Griffiths</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: Yes, certainly. As you rightly say, there were two separate tragic accidents, one of a lady and her grandson approaching from the Network Rail side—it is a two-part crossing—and the other the tragic death of a young girl coming from the Nottingham tram side. In between those two crossings there is an intermediate island. In the first one, the lady and her grandson first had to cross over a disused line and then on to a skewed crossing. We believe that part of the reason she may have been distracted was that she was looking for the edges of the crossing, which we felt needed illumination. We made a recommendation, as you have correctly identified, that there be collaboration between the local authority and Network Rail for illumination, for that reason. In the second case, we believe it was possible—we cannot be certain—that the glare of light might have been a distraction to the young lass on the tram side.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Our first recommendation said “Take account of” a number of things. One of those was to make sure that the person using this side of the crossing can still see the approaching train’s lights. We did not design in detail the Network Rail illumination. Therefore, when it was erected it was the gift of the people putting the lighting in as to how they installed it and the luminance they made it. We do not think that our two recommendations are inconsistent; it is just that we did not prescribe exactly how the installation should be, nor would that be in our gift.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q125 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> In relation to the Beech Hill fatal accident, you made a recommendation just to Network Rail, not to the Secretary of State, but it is the Secretary of State who is responsible for road traffic signs and signals.

The standard that applies to those lights makes reference to a European norm which allows for a variation in candelas—how bright the signs should be. The nature of the standard allows the infrastructure operator to tune the brightness of the lights to the circumstances. Obviously, bright lights in some circumstances would be right; in others, it would not. The deficient lights at Beech Hill would still have been to spec—there is deliberately a range of lamps. We wanted the infrastructure owner, still compliant with that standard, to take a more careful look as to how he tuned the brightness of those lamps to that circumstance. It was not the standard that needed changing; the standard deliberately gives you a range of luminance for your lamps.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q126 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> I would now like to ask Mr Jack and Mr Woods of the RSSB some questions. In your written submission you say that “the biggest determinant of level crossing safety is…road safety.” Could you explain that link to us?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Anson Jack</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: One of the things the RSSB does is collect data associated with all accidents on the main line. In collecting and analysing those data we look at the underlying causes of accidents, not in the way that Miss Griffiths does; this is just collecting the data and analysing it. Over the years, the data we collected have identified that the majority of accidents that happen at level crossings, be they footpath crossings or road level crossings, arise from either misunderstandings by the users of the crossings, or wilful misuse by users of the crossings. The area that we have been talking about to date tends to occupy about 10% of the risk at level crossings—the risk that can be affected by the rail industry itself.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The reason we put the point forward to the Committee is that, in exploring the very desirable outcome of improving level crossing safety, we wanted to draw attention to the fact that many of the risk factors are associated with performance on the roads. If I can back that up with a couple of references, a study is being done in Canada where at different times different states introduced proactive road safety campaigns. If you tracked the performance on level crossings, the incidence of events at those crossings exactly followed. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Another study looked around the world at level crossing performance. A lot of railways around the world report that they suffer from not being able to get enough attention from road authorities. A piece of work was done for an international congress on level crossing safety to look at the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">underlying cause of differences between different countries’ level crossing safety. A piece of work done by a guy who until very recently was a non</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">executive director of the Office of Rail Regulation highlighted that by far the strongest correlation across countries was between level crossing safety and their road traffic safety record. Countries such as the United Kingdom and Sweden, which have very good road traffic safety records, are also the countries that come through as having better performance on level crossings. That is not saying that every level crossing accident is not a tragic event. As Mr</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Prosser said, there are still things that can be done to improve them.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q127 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> You heard what Miss Griffiths said about concerns related to the adequacy of risk assessments, and she has also submitted written evidence on that point.

It may not be directly from industry sources, although we rely on our members to give us a lot of information. For instance, if it relates to safety, by virtue of the data that we have collected through the mandatory SMIS system that you referred to, we can use that system to validate any particular information that we are given for a research project. When it comes to the safety management information system in the round and how we satisfy ourselves that it is valid, we employ approximately 1.5</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">full-time equivalent people to do what we call health checks, but some people would call audits, of all of our members and the input they make to SMIS.

We have been working with the road and the rail sectors on three research projects running in parallel at the moment to see whether those various signs and signals are fit for purpose, whether they comply with modern human factors knowledge and whether they can be improved. In terms of public road crossings, we are hoping to make proposals to the Department for Transport’s review of traffic signs, which we have to submit by April of next year. There are two particular signs that we are looking at specifically in that area. I can elaborate if you think that is a good idea.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q133 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Martin Vickers:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Clearly, a great deal of time and effort is put into collecting data, researching evidence and the like.

Network Rail as the duty holder, with responsibility for the majority of level crossings, has the day job of deciding what are the problems, what are the risk assessments and what are the outcomes from that. That is one issue. Another issue is whether there is anything that the industry can reasonably and practicably do to improve things, by changing the standards, changing the way that risk assessments are done and so on. What we do, where the industry supports it, is make the research input: “Here are things that might be worth considering and might be reasonably practicable.” What Network Rail does is to take all of that and its other knowledge and decide what it is responsible for and what it should do.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q134 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Martin Vickers:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Are you satisfied that Network Rail act on all the evidence that you provide them with?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Anson Jack</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: It is not for us to be satisfied.

I am going to ask you about the four level crossings inside and the one just outside my constituency. I want to burrow down into what the safety risk is compared with how busy the railways are when all those four, plus one, level crossings involve road users. If you have a level crossing that has barriers down for, say, 20 minutes an hour, and it is going to be increased to 40 minutes an hour because of the level of railway traffic, what relationship does that have to safety issues? Is it exponential? Does it double? Or would you say it is all to do with the type of level crossing?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Anson Jack</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: Considering a single change like that, one could only speculate about what the change in risk would be. The model referred to earlier, which we developed for the industry, is called the all level crossing risk model, and has been the subject of some of Miss</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Griffiths’ recommendations. We are doing work to improve and enhance that model to support the industry. The specific risk at a specific crossing is so much a product of local circumstances that you clearly understand better than I do that one can only speculate about whether if you do this it will improve it, or if you do that it will make it worse. Sometimes making changes has counter-intuitive impacts.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q139 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Karl McCartney:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Surely, a level crossing in the middle of a field that a farmer uses has a risk because it is not manned and is not automatic.

You might think it would be more, but, if it is a farmer’s crossing and he finds himself using it more often, he might become more adept at using it, so maybe the risk will go down.

Please can I make it clear that we are a trade body, so we have no powers of compulsion over our members? It is a matter of persuasion. There is a lot in the report that we like. We think the closures and things like that are very good, but we are worried about the lack of certainty. At the moment, there are some major items and complex new provisions, which we understand may be appropriate for the fast main line railway, but our railways work at 40 kph—maximum—so they are relatively slow. Our level crossings are usually staffed, and a number of them have the old-fashioned signal boxes, and we see in the new regulations scope for things to become more difficult. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">For example, how do we persuade farmers and the motorist lobby to make an agreement? If you are part of a large group, like Network Rail, you have an army of solicitors with you. We do not have that luxury. You also get significant funding from the Government, as we heard, but all our expenses come out of our own pockets; we are all small enterprises. The largest turnover of any of our members is under £6</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">million, the average being £680,000, so any significant cost to our members has to be met, and usually it is a matter of juggling between one and the other.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">We are also very worried by the possibility of level crossing signs changing from one location to another.

We still have a long way to go, moving from a reactive to a proactive place. As to where I believe we are now, when we have an incident at a level crossing, we are able to find out true facts, good data and analysis that stand up to subsequent investigation much more quickly. Tragically, we had an incident just this morning on Mr Verster’s route. Within a couple of hours now, we are able to get all the facts and pass them over to the relevant investigating authorities, apart from ourselves, and those data stand up much more than the appalling place we were in back in 2005.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q162 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Network Rail’s lawyers at the time argued that the risk assessments should not be given to the inquest.

As I said, we are in a completely different place. In the last year, we have published the risk assessments of all our level crossings, as part of our move to much greater transparency.

We heard earlier about the all level crossing risk assessment tool used across the industry. That is very necessary, but I do not think it is sufficient.

The state our company was in over the risk assessment, and, to be honest, the subsequent behaviour of the company towards the families involved, were quite appalling. I think we have changed from that. I pay tribute to Tina Hughes and others who have helped get us there. She has been magnificent in helping us in the last two or three years. I believe that the company is in a much better place, but there is still a long way to go. Crossing the railway is dangerous, whether it is on foot or by vehicle.

One can learn from the excellent work, for example, of the British Transport Police liaison officers. It is different in each circumstance. How organisations such as ours would respond depends on the circumstance of the incident in which, tragically, somebody was killed and on the personal wishes of the bereaved themselves, but I would like to think that in such very difficult circumstances we would not behave as we clearly did after the Elsenham incident and others that are covered in other witnesses’ evidence.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q166 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> We have heard this afternoon about current concerns about risk assessments at level crossings.

We have improved that a lot in the last couple of years. The big step forward has been the appointment of 100 level crossing managers and the leadership of Martin Gallagher in the middle as head of level crossings. The training programmes we have put in, the new ways of gathering the data, the independent assessment of that and getting more managers out alongside the level crossing managers, are all helping to make sure that we are gathering the right data. We are not just relying on the cold numbers but asking broader questions and seeking broader advice on level crossing usage. That is giving us a better risk profile than would have been the case in the past.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q167 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Do you distinguish between misuse and unintended error?

I think in some of the other witness statements there were some very good comments about human factors. Some of the language used—“misjudgment”, “errors of judgment”, “misuse” and “abuse”—needs tidying up. Fundamentally, we are trying to make crossing the railway as safe as possible, given that it is a dangerous environment. We could be rather clearer in our language between occasions of abuse and trespass, which do happen but which </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">are not nearly as significant as errors of judgment and misuse. On the latter, we can do a lot more through education—there is a repeat of our advertisement about the risks of level crossings coming out again today—and through how we engineer level crossings to minimise the chance of anybody being injured or killed.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q168 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Is there full co-operation between yourselves—the railways holder—and the highways authorities, or is that an area of difficulty?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robin Gisby</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: It is one where we work closely with them.

Some of that is linked to planning applications and so on in the normal course of events. That situation might arise if there was, say, a very significant housing development on the other side of a railway track that was going to generate a lot more traffic. We might have a discussion with the developer about the cost of putting a bridge over the railway and making it safe for a considerable increase in traffic.

We are upgrading our risk assessments all the time, so that we are on top of this as much as we can be, and then making sure that in our responses to those risk assessments we are minimising the risk, and hopefully eliminating the crossing altogether. We are moving as quickly as we can in that area.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">We could do with some help in this area. As we said in our submission, the closure process is sometimes a little cumbersome. We have managed to close about 700 in the five-year control period that finishes in March of next year. As for the money we have for the next control period, in the initial determination of the Office of Rail Regulation we were offered something like £69</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">million. We went back and asked for more, and they have given us another £30 million-plus, so we are well over the £100 million mark. As we spend that money on a mix of reducing risk at some crossings and closures, I would seek to close about another 500, which is the number everybody is discussing.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">To give an example of how we might do that, we have more than 600 crossings of the railway at the moment, whether footpath, user-worked or road crossings, where there is an alternative crossing within 200</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">metres. Those are particular ones where we would seek to close one and make greater use of the other, but we need to balance that with the overall view of risk. We must prioritise on a risk basis across the network. I would not like to come back here in two or three years’ time to say that I had managed to close 300 or 400 crossings just to achieve some numbers if I had not done all I could to continue to reduce risk.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q173 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> How many crossings rely on whistle boards?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robin Gisby</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: I do not have that exact number to hand. They are usually in rural areas—footpath crossings and so on. There is a mix of things we can do at whistle boards. There was some discussion two or three years ago about the use of whistle boards at night. We have had some issues—you talked earlier about the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Mexico</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> level crossing in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Cornwall</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. We have an issue elsewhere as to whether or not the whistle board can be heard properly and whether it gives enough sighting time. As soon as you move the whistle board further away from the level crossing to improve the time for pedestrians to cross, you perhaps reduce the time when it is audible. Some technology that we are introducing, which I believe one of your previous witnesses mentioned, is to sound the warning at the crossing by equipment that we put at the crossing itself, rather than it coming from the train. That gives you a much more audible and local sound, as well as the lights and so on that we use at other level crossings, so that crossing users can hear it immediately, rather than planning on whistle boards that might be some distance down the track.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q174 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Are you satisfied with the number and expertise of level crossing managers?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robin Gisby</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: I am in a much better place, having 100-plus of them, getting them out there and training them. I have been out with them myself. The work they are doing is really important. Having them dedicated and specialist is a huge step forward from where we were two or three years ago. A level crossing is quite a complex thing, not just in the movement of people but in their technology. I have 14 or 15 different types of level crossing, some dating back to Victorian times. I have a lot of footpath crossings and a lot where I am dependent on a farmer or other user in how they cross it. That will vary during the year—if it is harvest time—and in some of the equipment they use. I am in a much better place now, the company is in a much better place, and I think users of the railway are in a much better place, because of the level crossing managers and their increasing expertise. It is a very specialist role. To go back to 2005, it was a role split among other things people did. That was inadequate and the focus now is much better.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q175 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Sanders:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Do you have a very long-term plan to eradicate all level crossings, or will that always be a pipe dream?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robin Gisby</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: If we built the railway from scratch and started again, we would not have any. Our priority must be to eliminate the highest risk locations, not just the easy ones to close. You start looking at density of traffic and high-speed routes; that is where we have prioritised, and we will continue to do that. Where we do upgrades of significant railway lines, as we are doing on the Great Western main line and elsewhere round the country, we always ask ourselves the question—much more than we would have done five years ago—“What can we do to eliminate this level crossing, as opposed to upgrading it?” That might involve an underpass, a bridge over the top or diverting traffic to somewhere else.

We are keeping on top of this all the time. It varies a little: if you look two or three years out, it varies as rail and road movements change, both vehicles and pedestrians; it also varies a little around planning and closure issues—getting permission to put in a footbridge and so on.

It is important to recognise that the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> has the best level crossing safety record in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> and, by extension, the world. If we exclude suicides and suspected suicides, there were nine fatalities on the network between 2012 and 2013. Of course, any death is deeply tragic, but all of these deaths happened as a direct result of misuse, either accidental or wilful, by the crossing users themselves; indeed, the latest figures indicate that 90% of the risk factors at level crossings arise from public behaviour. For instance, the most recent example—a near miss at Waterbeach in September—involved a cyclist who chose to ignore the crossing barrier, the warning lights and the warning sounds and decided to cross while the train was approaching. I am very pleased to say that she avoided death or severe injury, but it was only by the narrowest of margins. I am sure we all hope that she will never do that again, but it is that type of misuse which we must seek to prevent in the first place. Such behaviour not only puts the member of the public who does it at risk but has severe consequences potentially for both the operator and the train passengers. While rail industry operational errors or other process issues do occur, we should recognise that all the evidence is that they account for only a tiny percentage of level crossing incidents.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Aside from closure, obviously the best way to reduce risk at level crossings is to ensure that they are used safely and that any instructions displayed are followed. I think we can praise Network Rail for the work they have done in raising public awareness of the inherent risks of misuse through the Don’t Run the Risk campaign and other initiatives. I know that they are still very keen to reduce that number further, and the Don’t Run the Risk campaign has contributed to meeting the target of reducing level crossing risk by some 25% by the end of March 2014, a year earlier than the targets set for the control period.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Network Rail should be congratulated on that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The Government are supporting the work by providing £109</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">million, ring-fenced, to deliver maximum reduction in risks at level crossings, until 2019.

What I sought to do was to explain how many of the deaths had arisen, whether it was misuse or failing accidentally to see the barrier in place or the warning signs. Clearly, there are occasions when Network Rail, or other railway causes, may be at fault, but we have to recognise that we need a greater programme of education so that people clearly understand the risks they run. No one is underestimating the level of personal tragedy that anyone feels from a bereavement, but at the same time I have to recognise that we need to educate the public that, first, incidents are relatively infrequent and therefore perhaps some people do not take them as seriously as they should, but misusing or failing properly to acknowledge what a crossing is trying to tell you, i.e. stop, is likely to have very unfortunate and tragic consequences.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q184 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> What do you think the role of the Department should be in reducing the level of tragic accidents?

Of course, there are things we can do in terms of the highways, but the key is to concentrate on how we can improve safety, and that is to use the money we are giving to Network Rail to close crossings where we can and make crossings even safer. Some of the work Network Rail is doing now, in terms of spoken word announcements and making sure there are full barrier closures, is key. Equally key is ensuring that we all support the Don’t Run the Risk campaign that Network Rail are running.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q195 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Could there be an issue to do with clarity of signage, which is something your Department should take an interest in?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Stephen Hammond</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: We are taking an interest in it.

There will always be some errors, but I want to continue to see improvement in the overall safety record of the railway, and some of that will be to do with level crossings. We are devoting £109</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">million in the allocation to the improvement of safety. I will be seeking an assurance from my officials that the money is being spent on the highest risk crossings, and, if we are looking for a reduction in risk, I will also want to see that that is shown in a reduction in fatalities.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q199 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Graham Stringer:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> We have just had Network Rail before us. They accepted that their treatment of the families of victims on level crossings has not always been appropriate or as good as it should be.

There are other types of support. In particular, the British Transport Police has a dedicated victims and witness support group that is available to access. In what Network Rail choose to do, and how they choose those policies, I hope they would wish to show every sympathy to the bereaved families of victims. I am sure that is what they try to do, but exactly who they choose to turn up with is a matter for them as a private company.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q200 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Graham Stringer:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> It is a matter for them, but you can have an opinion on whether it is appropriate for a large company like Network Rail, which is effectively in the public sector, whatever the technicalities of its ownership, to turn up with PR people.

On a micro-scale, what involvement is there within your Department, or with you personally, with any particular level crossing? Do you just have an overall view of the strategy and leave it to Network Rail per se? That is my understanding so far of the particular instances in my constituency of Lincoln. Phil Verster, whom we did not get to question, was like a breath of fresh air when he came into his role, but I do not think the Department get involved in any micro-issues, do you?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Stephen Hammond</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: Rather like you, Mr McCartney, I get involved in micro-issues in my constituency. I have a very controversial level crossing in my constituency, so at that level, yes; at my ministerial level, no. The Department works with Network Rail but it is Network Rail’s responsibility in almost all cases, as the duty holder. Where there are other duty holders, it is their responsibility to ensure that the appropriate and highest levels of safety are undertaken.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q202 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Karl McCartney:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> With this arm’s length relationship that the Department may have with Network Rail, they went back to the ORR to say they wanted more money than they were given originally, as we found out earlier today. Because of particular instances around the country, would you say, “We should probably give Network Rail more money to ameliorate more problems or safety aspects at various level crossings,” or do you see the answer as closing as many level crossings as possible, which for some of us is just not an option?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Stephen Hammond</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: As I indicated earlier, ultimately the safest way to ensure there is no problem would be to close as many level crossings as possible, which is why that is part of what the money is being spent on and why 700 have been closed in the last five years. My understanding is that the ORR’s initial view was that around £67 million was appropriate for England and Wales and £13 million for Scotland. The sum was increased from that level to the £109</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">million, which is now split between England and Wales and Scotland.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q203 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Karl McCartney:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Those are interesting figures, particularly for </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, which may be dependent on how many railways there are across the geographical landscape.

The most important thing is that, at local level, the people who understand the issues at particular level crossings can make those improvements at that level. Network Rail made a good step forward with that. They could work with local authorities and think about the specifics and detail that always make that one crossing a little safer.
