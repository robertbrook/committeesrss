I guess one of the bits of background to this session is to wonder where the voice of Public Health </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has been in some of the public health discussions over the last seven months.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Duncan </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Selbie</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Minimum unit pricing and, for that matter, standardised packaging came very early in our creation. We were certainly free to give our views, which we did. With some humility, we would accept that it was too early in our days for us to be of any real materiality in the policy decision, but our views have certainly been sought and, we believe, listened to. To go straight to your question—are we free to speak or to publish, or are we fettered in any way?—that is not how we are experiencing it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q5 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Could you talk to us a bit about how you develop a point of view on those kinds of issues where there is a high level of political interest, sometimes with a capital P and sometimes with a small p?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Duncan </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Selbie</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The most important thing to convey is that we would speak to the evidence rather than to opinion. Would this be an opportunity to involve Kevin Fenton in talking specifically about those two policies? It does go wider.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Fenton</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: A key part of what we do in the agency is really to look at the evidence regarding the burden of disease and what are some of the core priorities we should be focused on, whether in the health improvement domain, the health protection domain or the health inequalities domain. We know that there are substantial data showing us the burden of disease that is attributable to behaviours such as smoking, alcohol and drugs, high body weight or obesity, and other risk factors and behaviours. Those identify areas where we need to prioritise both investment in our research and investment in our programmes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Based on those investments, we are able to generate new data, new policy positions or programmatic positions that we can then share with our partners working at local level or across the system. We certainly work with Government partners to say, “These are emerging </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">priorities that need to be addressed,” and “How can Public Health </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> work with you to ensure that we are driving health impact in these areas?” Everything really starts at characterising the epidemiology of disease, characterising the burden, looking at where there are health inequalities, looking at where there is evidence for us to make real improvements and impact, and then using those data to drive and to prioritise action.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Specifically, on MUP and plain packaging for tobacco, it is very clear that these are two areas where we need to do a much better job as a country, to continue both to drive down smoking rates among adults and to limit the initiation of smoking among young adults. Data from a number of systematic evidence reviews from many western industrialised countries are now consistent in showing that standardised packaging would have tremendous benefits both in reducing the attractiveness of smoking to young people and decreasing the acceptability and attractiveness of smoking to current smokers. It would provide opportunities to have much clearer messages on the packages related to health and the harms of smoking. That is an area where the evidence on prevalence and incidence, prioritising where we should focus and then looking at the evidence on what works really drive our actions.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Duncan </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Selbie</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We want to make an observation on a more recent issue—shale gas extraction.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Cosford</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: If it is of interest to the Committee, as you will be aware, we have national scientific experts on the health impacts on people of chemical and radiation exposures. Over the past year or so, they have done some extensive work on the potential public health impact on communities in the areas where </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">fracking</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> or shale gas extraction would potentially take place. The process we have gone through there is a very extensive scientific exploration of the evidence on whether there are immediate health harms from that process. We have published openly—but for comment, in the first instance, from people who may think that we have missed some of the evidence—to get that evidence finalised and to give a clear view from Public Health England on the public health impact of shale gas extraction.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q6 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Keeley</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The next shale gas exploration site is in my constituency, so this is a very lively issue for me. I have to say that I was profoundly disappointed in what you came up with, because my constituents are very concerned indeed about these health issues, particularly the possible introduction of new chemicals polluting an atmosphere where we already have some of the worst air quality in the country. My constituency has three motorways and some of the busiest trunk roads in the country; I definitely have the worst traffic junction anywhere in Greater Manchester. In fact, the Highways Agency has just shelved a plan to widen the motorway at that point because the air pollution is so bad on so many days of the year that it was thought that we cannot have the motorway any busier.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Into that soup of appalling air quality we now have very close to schools, farms and houses an organisation that wants to start introducing chemicals. The whole process—this is the point where I take issue with your initial conclusions—is that you seem to say, “This is a process that’s safe if it’s monitored properly and if the processes are followed.” My take on that is that we have no idea. You have no idea and we have no idea. Nobody in this country has any experience of these processes. I think it is far too early.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I am sure the Government were delighted with what you said, given that they want to rush to shale gas and the Prime Minister wants to win a debate on it, but my constituents deserve a bit more calm and real consideration of evidence, which we do not have. I have read some very </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">frightening things about pollution and emissions from the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.

Our scientists are also doing work on combating air pollution, what is required to address that and the potential health harms from air pollution.

The health check programme is a population-based risk awareness, risk assessment and risk management programme that is offered to individuals in the population aged 40 to 74 years once every five years, with the intention of identifying the early risk factors for cardiovascular disease, kidney disease and stroke. More recently, a component was added to increase awareness around dementia as well. We are looking at early intervention with individuals within the population, to educate them about their risks and to manage those risks.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q44 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Valerie </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Vaz</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You know that the Royal </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">College</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> of General Practitioners does not like it very much.

In this country, we are dealing with a crisis of non-communicable diseases—high burdens of chronic diseases and lifestyle factors that are driving not only individual misery and premature mortality but also tremendous costs to the NHS. To be honest, we have been doing the same things over and over and having very little impact in terms of our relative performance in addressing these chronic diseases in this country. We really need, therefore, to think about innovative approaches that can help both to educate and to engage the population around their health earlier so that we can take control of health in a more strategic way.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The health check programme has come under some controversy, in part because of a systematic review that was done by the Cochrane Collaboration and published last year. It looked at about nine randomised control trials of general health checks that were offered between the late 1960s and the early 1990s—so the most recent study was nearly 20 years ago. That systematic review looked at the impact of those general health checks on population mortality. The Cochrane study was unable to demonstrate any impact on mortality. The systematic review also tried to look at the impact on morbidity—what happened with disease outcomes; did it make any difference? Unfortunately, the quality of the studies, because they were so old, did not allow it to look at those intermediate determinants.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I think that generated a certain amount of uncertainty and angst, certainly within some sectors of the provider community, about whether this is a worthwhile investment. We feel that the health check programme as it is currently designed is very different from the health checks that are in the systematic review. We are not doing a general health check—we are doing a health check that is really focused on cardiovascular risk. We are doing a health check whose individual components have been reviewed and approved by NICE. The pathways that are implemented are all based on NICE-recommended actions. What is different with the health check programme is that we are combining these individual interventions into one, for the first time. I think some colleagues are wondering whether or not that is an effective way of doing it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q45 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Valerie </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Vaz</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">think</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> it is </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">worth</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> while?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Fenton</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We have certainly looked at the programme as part of the transition from management by the Department of Health to Public Health </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.

I can tell you that it was a wonderful opportunity for me to speak about my level of exercise, alcohol </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">intake and so on. It depends on what is actually found in the risk assessment. Most people who come through may have one or two issues that may require some advice, a brief intervention or referral to a risk management service—for example, a weight management service and so on. Very few, depending on their cardiovascular risk, may require further diagnosis for particular illness and, therefore, be placed on specific management. The good thing there is that the health checks offer us an opportunity for early identification of problems, engagement with individuals on their risk and having a conversation about health.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q49 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Valerie </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Vaz</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Among</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> the staff—the public health people who work in Public Health </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—did you hear the voices against this, saying that this was not a good idea?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Fenton</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes.

We have our health protection responsibilities, which are not replicated anywhere else in the system.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">At Public Health England, as a body, we do not regard ourselves as important; what we hope is that what we offer will be important. There is the obvious work that we do around health protection, but there is the wider work that this nation has never prioritised, which is about the improvement of health. There is now a voice for health improvement that is national. We hope with and through others, particularly local government but across Government, to stimulate a debate so that we are not spending everything we have when it has all gone wrong.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q70 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Would Dr </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Cosford</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> like to come in on the health protection function?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Cosford</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Perhaps I could give a brief story. Some time ago, on a Friday afternoon, we had identified to us a new virus from a patient from the middle east in one of our </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> hospitals. It was a very severe virus. Nobody could understand why he was as ill as he was. We did the work, identified the virus and identified what its characteristics were. It was the new MERS </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">coronavirus</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">At the time, we were not sure whether or not it was going to be a new SARS outbreak. Over a weekend we had teams working nationally in our laboratories sequencing it and with the hospital teams locally to know how to handle the patient, how best to protect staff, how best to prevent spread and what we could do internationally to find whether there were any other cases. On the Saturday afternoon we had our first advice out. We spent some time on it afterwards. It turns out not to be quite such a transmissible infection as we feared, but that is one example of an immediate response to a new, emerging, very severe potential harm that we would have sorted. I am sure the Committee would think that that was of value.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Likewise, we have some of the best vaccination programmes in the world. We are responsible for continuing the oversight of those programmes. Since 1 April, we have introduced four new vaccination programmes across the country that have protected people in a variety of different age groups from a variety of different infectious diseases. Those are just a couple of examples from a health protection point of view. I could quote many.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q71 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Sharma:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> There are two points I am </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">very</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> concerned about. First, if somebody is told that they may be at risk in future of suffering from dementia, are you creating a fear in the mind of that individual, even if you are telling him or her, “These are the treatments. These are the best exercises,” and all that you have explained? That is the first point.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The other one relates to health checks. You are giving authority to the local dentist. The dentist might be treating your teeth and, right in the middle, might ask you whether you have had your health checks and advise you to get them done as well before you leave, because you are offering that individual extra payment and greed is part of human nature. They will say, “That is an extra few pounds that I or the dentistry will be making.” Don’t you fear that you are forcing people to have health checks or that others will force them to get health checks for different reasons?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Duncan </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Selbie</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: That is very interesting, because coercion is not part of this at all. What I was reflecting in response to Ms </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Vaz</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> was that dentists are highly trained individuals who see 2 million people each week in this nation. We know that—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q72 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Sharma:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Don’t you </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">think</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> that this can happen and that you are giving an opportunity for it to happen?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Duncan </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Selbie</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: If you want to have a conversation about your health, catching people when they are coming to see you is a good moment. It is a good thing—it is an opportunity. People who go to see the dentist may not be going to see the GP. It is just about taking every opportunity to have a conversation about how you are doing and whether there is anything that you could be doing to improve your health and your life chances. What I was reflecting was that it is not just about GPs, as important as GPs are. There are many other professionals who can have these conversations. We know that people still listen to their doctor, their pharmacist and their dentist. The connection with getting paid for it is interesting.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Rosie has a question specifically about that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q73 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Rosie Cooper:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I am obviously on another planet today.

We have severely restricted resources all piling down this avenue. How are you going to check? The databases will not be there to cross-check it. This is just another licence—it is G4 rampant, or Serco, or somebody else. They are going to take us to the cleaners.

That is what I was referring to. Professor Fenton said something about what actually happens. It might be an indulgence, but I led an acute teaching hospital for five years and can tell you what the consequence was of not having these conversations about health. Just listen to what Marmot </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">has to say. We know that 50% of everything affecting length of life and life without misery in it is the personal choices that we make.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q74 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> But what is </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">the</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> answer to Rosie’s question?

All individuals who participate in the health check are actually invited for their health check. This is done once every five years. It is done by a letter that is sent out from the GP practice. On receipt of the letter, they are invited to do the health check either in the general practice or at participating sites, which may include the local pharmacy or the local dental practice, depending on what sites are part of the programme.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">When I did my health check, I chose to do it at my GP practice. I could easily have gone to one of the local pharmacies. Whichever sites are participating in a locality are able both to collect the data and to ensure that the data that are received from the health check are fed back to the GP practice, so the GP is aware of what has been offered, what the results are and whatever steps need to be taken. There is integration across the system. That is why I think that the health check programme is both responsible in managing resources and has built-in checks, so to speak, because we are able to look at the data flow—who has been offered the check and what its outcomes are. This is what we are doing as part of the implementation of the programme. I hope that reassures you that there is good governance and good oversight of the programme locally.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Duncan </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Selbie</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The contracts are let by local government—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q75 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So these are not </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">opportunistic</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> health checks.

The Committee is currently undertaking an inquiry into the management of long-term conditions; I am sure you have touched on it before. Can you outline </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">how obesity contributes to long-term conditions and morbidity in the population?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Fenton</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Thank you for that question. I am really glad you are focusing this on long-term conditions. As you know, obesity is one of the major public health crises that we have in this country. Currently, nearly two thirds of adults are either overweight or obese, and it has tremendous impacts on cost to the NHS and premature mortality in the country. We </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">know that obesity is a challenge across the life course, with nearly one in five school-entry children being overweight or obese and one in three young adults as they leave school being obese. So we have a real problem.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I think the creation of Public Health </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and the new system transformation we have just been through provide us with an amazing new opportunity to do something different to address this epidemic. First, we can use organisations and leaders such as ourselves to take the bully pulpit to talk about the burden of this epidemic and what needs to be done, thinking about the evidence and how we apply that to work. Secondly, the creation of local government as the seat of public health, looking at the health of its communities, leveraging assets from active travel to leisure centres, and beginning to think about the built environment and ways in which we can encourage both better eating through planning and changes to the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">obesogenic</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> environment, provides an amazing opportunity for us to address the epidemic.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Finally, there are examples where we are now beginning to see real improvements in responding to the obesity epidemic. Recently, I visited Rotherham, which I am sure you have heard about, which is one jurisdiction that has done tremendous work in reversing the trend—the trajectory—of childhood obesity. There were three key elements of success there that I would like briefly to share with you today.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The first is leadership. The local council and local leaders agreed that this was going to be a priority and that they were going to put in resources—to put their money where their mouth is. The second is to look at what works and to do a much better job of implementing that, looking across the life course. The third is to ensure that there is robust infrastructure for evaluating their progress and to make mid-course corrections to enhance their efforts moving forward. I would like to see that rolled out across the country and to see more local authorities—more jurisdictions, supported by colleagues at Public Health </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—doing exactly that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q79 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">David </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tredinnick</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> My local council does this anyway. It has a programme of trying to get people into exercise and trying to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">address</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> obesity, too. Does it really need a national push, with vast numbers of people, to tell people that they are too fat?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Duncan </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Selbie</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The “vast numbers of people” are scientists. The great majority of our people are working in our laboratories and scientific centres. We are not talking about vast numbers of people employed by Public Health </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> who are telling everybody what they should eat and so on. This is not how we have been constructed.

We have been looking at all of this. As a Committee, we have been over all the ground we can find on this terrain, and we are doing it assiduously. I am just saying to you that, for me, body mass index is a pretty straightforward measurement. You measure your waist. If you are </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">2 inches</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> too big against the index, you weigh too much, you know you have the problem that Professor Fenton is describing. I just do not know to what extent we need a national body to tell us that we are doing this when all the local people—the doctors and everyone else—are saying, “You’ve got to lose weight,” and, “You must exercise more.” I am just questioning you—that is all.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Duncan </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Selbie</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Before Professor Fenton gives the proper answer, whatever we have been doing for the last 20 or 30 years, it has not been working. We need to be standing in a different place, or the music </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">has</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> altered so we cannot continue to dance in the same way. The national organisation you are referring to—established by the Government, not by us—was set up to say, “This we cannot continue with.”</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">This is a big issue, because the conversation that is being had in this House today is all about what is going on in hospitals and A and E departments and not about where the main action is, which is what people are experiencing in their day-to-day lives, whether they have employment and whether they have decent places in which to live—the sorts of things that are absolutely core to what local government cares about.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Your county council, which I am going up to see in a couple of weeks’ time, will be as passionate about this as the other half that I have met in the last year. They talk with a passion about this. Their closest partners, as CCGs and GPs coming together, care more than we could ever care about this stuff. What is different is that there is now a national voice, with some freedoms but responsibilities to go with those, to say, “Do you know? Holding up the mirror, we are just doing this wrong.”</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We can have a conversation about health checks and whether that is right, but at least it is a first endeavour to do something that is not about waiting until hundreds of young people pile into A and E departments, paralytic. All we are doing is rehydrating them, not having a conversation about why. Do you know that the test for an acute teaching hospital on vascular care is whether not to amputate, not, “Why are you a chaotic diabetic?” or even, “Why are you diabetic at all?” With the new legal duty placed on local government, this is a conversation we can now have.

What work are you undertaking to support local authorities in their programme to reduce the rate of obesity? In the last 20 or 30 years, we have failed, but what targets are connected to these interventions and over what time frame will their success or failure be measured? What is the time scale, and what support are you giving to local authorities?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Fenton</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Very briefly, we are aligning ourselves to the ambitions set by the Government, which are to see a flattening of the epidemic trajectory by 2020. Remember that no western industrialised country has turned the tide of obesity, so this is an ambitious target in itself.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In terms of how we support local government, we have now established a PHE healthy weight and obesity programme, which is focused on four key areas. The first is ensuring that we have and provide the evidence on what works and we work to translate that evidence to local government in ways that matter to it, so that it can do a much better job of implementing. Secondly, we are supporting local systems by really looking at what is working locally—looking at examples such as Rotherham to see what we can learn from those jurisdictions and how we can facilitate the diffusion of innovation and of that evidence, so that we can do a much better job of learning more quickly.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Thirdly, we are really looking at supporting the system through training and capacity building. We have not really had a national focus on obesity. For something that is so prevalent in this country, we have never had that at a programmatic level. Now is the time for us to do it and to look at ways in which we train, skill up and support our local systems.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Finally, the thing we are really passionate about is looking at health inequalities. We know that obesity is not randomly distributed in the population. If you are living in poor or deprived circumstances, you are far more likely to be obese or to have a higher BMI. We really want to work with those areas to understand what more we can do to target our efforts to address the obesity epidemic there. That gives you a flavour of what we are doing with our programme. We really just started in April this year.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q83 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So far, we have </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">been</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> discussing obesity for about 10 minutes without discussing food.

We are supportive of responsibility deals, recognising that this is one of a series of interventions that we have really to change the environment to improve health. These include using legislation and policy, partnering with industry, thinking about individual interventions and thinking of community-level interventions. We should not view the responsibility deal as the only game in town—it is one of many.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We know that, through the responsibility deal, there have been some successes. It is currently being evaluated, and PHE looks forward to seeing the results of the evaluation, which will be available in the next 12 to 18 months. However, we have to look at some of the accomplishments: reductions in the population intake of salt; front-of-package labelling, which will come out shortly; and some of the interventions on workplace well-being, which have been done through collective leadership of business. Has it been enough? Has it been fast enough and impactful enough? That is what the evaluation will show, but I think we </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">should not denigrate some of the real achievements of using this approach to help to change the environments in which we are currently living, working, playing and even praying.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">              </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Barbara wants to come to another cause of ill health—smoking.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Keeley</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Before I leave our earlier point,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> just as a piece of information, there was a letter in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">The Independent</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> yesterday from Professor Andrew Watterson, the director of the centre for public health at the university of Stirling, who pointed out—given the points we made earlier—that your report on shale gas specifically excludes occupational health and safety.

Those are some of the benefits that we are likely to see. It is our role as an agency to ensure that we are collating the evidence, presenting it to policy makers and presenting it to our local partners to ensure that they are able to make decisions based on the best available evidence.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">One of the other things we are doing in the agency is looking at the impact of the introduction of standardised packaging in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Australia</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, where, as you know, it was introduced last year. We are still in the first year post-introduction. One of the challenges is that at the time when Australia introduced standardised packaging, it introduced a range of other interventions as well, so it is going to be hard to tease out the unique contribution of standardised packaging.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That brings me to my last point—that none of these interventions should be viewed in isolation. They are a package of comprehensive, integrated prevention programmes that are really needed to drive down levels of smoking.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Duncan </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Selbie</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: If I think about hospital-acquired infections, a number of years ago we had very embarrassing levels of MRSA and clostridium </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">difficile</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, which are dreadful things. Over a period of time, we tried a number of different interventions—washing hands, doctors not wearing ties and watches, looking at the antibiotic policy and looking at aseptic ways of doing things in hospitals. No one could ever say that a particular intervention was the main one that led to the improvements, but, if you had the package of them, you could expect to see improvements. As a nation, we have such a lot to be proud of on this.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Similarly with smoking, standardised packaging is believed to be the next step in the journey. It is not all that ever matters; we could spend much of our time this afternoon on everything else that matters. The supply chain for the tobacco industry is children—200,000 a year starting smoking. Normally, I would have the packaging in front. There is some emergent evidence about how attractive </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">slimline</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> cigarettes are. You would think that intuitively, but the evidence now supports it. There are cigarettes that change flavour when you flick a switch and ones that look like </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">iPhones</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. It is just attractive. We do not know, because the evidence does not yet exist and will take time to come out of Australia and other parts, but we believe—and it appears to be the view—that this is the next important step. It would be very odd to have a public health agency that was not in support of anything that would reduce the impact of tobacco. It remains the number one killer by a country mile.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q86 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">Keeley</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I understand that, because my local authority smoking rate is 25%, which is more than the national average, and 1,000 children a year are judged to start smoking in Salford. There is a concern that we included in our debate that fewer people are successfully quitting smoking now and fewer people are attempting to quit. Just a couple of weeks ago, we saw figures for between April 2012 and March 2013. There was a decline in the number of people setting a date to quit and a 7% fall in the number successfully quitting for four weeks. That has emerged in the debates we have had here. You have talked about a package of measures, but really we are seeing something that is going backwards. I do not know whether there has been anything in the last few months that indicates why that is.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Fenton</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There are various data that are coming out at the moment. I think we need to be careful in both taking a slightly longer-term view and triangulating all the various data sources. We know that patterns of use of smoking cessation services are changing as people’s quit behaviours and quit attempts change as well. The ways in which people are quitting are also changing. They are using more nicotine replacement therapy. The emergence of e-cigarettes is also going to be a disruptive influence on the trends that we are seeing in terms of quitting from smoking and then, of course, from nicotine. I would say that, yes, there are some emerging data, but I think we need a little bit more time really to bottom out what is happening with the trends and to begin to triangulate those data sources.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q87 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Grahame M. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">Morris</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I have a question in a similar vein, moving from cigarettes to alcohol.

On this idea of following the evidence, I am sure you are aware that this Committee held an inquiry and published a report last year about the Government’s alcohol strategy; I hope you are familiar with that. One of the problems that we had—which you have just alluded to in relation to plain packaging—is that there seems to be little evidence on which to base policy, in terms of what the specific public health benefits would be.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I am talking about minimum unit pricing of alcohol here.

Richard can come on to some of the issues we have been talking through there. The principles are clear in my head—and, I think, in others’ heads as well. The principles are that Public Health England leads on the specialist health protection response. It will chair an outbreak control committee, for instance, if there is an outbreak, make sure that the right specialist advice is provided on how to control an outbreak of infectious disease or mobilise our air quality monitoring cells when there is a fire that is spewing noxious chemicals across a community. The NHS is responsible for responding and providing the clinical response. The local authority is responsible for making sure that those plans work properly and are working in effect for the local population.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Richard </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gleave</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: This has to be a local first service that is focused around what happens in the individual patches, but it is a service that needs to be escalated quickly should something grow and spread. Those two principles, about handling both of those aspects, are absolutely at the heart of the Public Health England contribution.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We have put together a group that has the Faculty of Public Health, the Local Government Association, the Association of Directors of Public Health, NHS England and us.

The risks here are not just biological threats but also the chemical and radiation incidents we have talked about before. The breadth of knowledge that we need to provide as Public Health </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> to support the local teams is crucial.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We have agreement that we are going to ask each of the local health resilience partnerships across the country to look at their own local arrangements, to ensure that the partners together have looked one another in the eye and agreed how they will address the different sorts of incidents that might occur. There is not one national, one-size-fits-all model that will work for this. There is a national resource that can be pulled upon to provide consistent support. That is what we provide—often with support from NHS England, but that is our unique contribution to it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q100 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">David </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tredinnick</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> On the point that you made about nuclear issues, as someone who served in the forces a while back, can I ask what liaison you have with the Ministry of Defence?

We have the national expertise on radiation exposures and also contribute to the monitoring around a site.

There is a discussion to be had about why that might be, but a big driver of that is that the folk that have heard the messages about what they can do to improve health, and have had the choices, have been exercising them—you meet very few doctors who smoke, for example—and those who have not been hearing them, or have not been able to act on them, have not.

We have seen £2 billion go out of adult social care budgets. Surely, in those places where that is happening the worst there is going to be an impact on health inequality, because people are not getting care and support this year that they may have had last year or the year before.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Duncan </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Selbie</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: What I would add—perhaps this is something we have not talked about—is that, with the local public health system, the legal duty to improve health now rests with local government.

I am asking because NHS England is currently consulting on funding allocations; in fact, it is next month, or within the next couple of weeks.

We said that within six months—we are in this period now—we would begin a conversation about three and five years, with a view to the next 10 and 20 years, because some of these things take longer, but other things can happen a lot faster. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The conversation with the head of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">home </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">civil service, was around what we wanted to do: to introduce the idea of a framework for health and well-being as a nation, one that set out the evidence of what was driving poor health, inequalities—all the things that Ms </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Keeley</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> referred to about when you are with your constituents, and you are out there and seeing the lives that people are having to live.

Our particular contribution, if you are familiar with the NHS atlases, is in looking at variations in outcome around the country, and we definitely have a role in co-ordinating and extending that evidence base. We also have a local implementation duty.

I have been uncharacteristically quiet because I am making a major contribution to the public health of this country by keeping a quarantine space around me.

Is there any point in local directors of public health, or, rather, local authority involvement in public health at the local level, given that a lot of the programmes are mandated? Mr </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Gleave</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, you indicated earlier that Public Health England can use the Secretary of State’s power to step in if they are failing, particularly in the case of emergencies. Is there any role for local authorities, who have a democratic mandate? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Duncan </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Selbie</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is difficult to know where to start about where we have been on this. This is not meant to sound terribly unkind, but the public health responsibilities that have rested with the NHS for a number of ye</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">a</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">rs have not had the attention or thrived in the way that we would have hoped. Mostly, I am talking of upper tier local government, but districts have a place as well. They are receiving new clarified duties to improve health, but they have never not been responsible. All the determinants that we have been talking about are hugely important. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">A small amount of money—not insignificant, but not huge compared to the health care spend—is transferred into local government. It is roughly £3 billion a year, so that gives you a sense of the percentage. Local government’s interest, like ours, is not in that £3 billion but in the £100 billion that they spend, and the £100 billion that the health service has, and the £100-plus billion that the voluntary and third sector has. If this conversation had taken a different course, we would have spent most of our time talking about the impact of local government on improving health. It is massive, and what is driving it is a passion and a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">knowledge of place and people. They do not present as conditions; they present as people—real people living in real places, in context. Coming along and saying, “We don’t think you should be smoking,” is probably not a smart intervention when dealing with all the issues that have been raised this afternoon. The democratic connection is hugely important as well. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We see the health protection responsibilities that Richard was referring to and the Secretary of State’s power, but we are not going to hang around and wait for permission; if it needs to be done, it will get done. The majority of our added value from where previous organisations have been is in this wider context, and local government is mission-critical to this. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q133 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrew George:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Why do you </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">need</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> to mandate funding?

The Secretary of State has mandated that it must do certain things. The biggest contributors are the sexual health services. What is not mandated is drug and alcohol services, but that is another huge contribution. Then there are a small number of things, like child measurement systems and so on. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The most fundamental </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">mandation</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is the public health advice that they must give to CCGs about how they prioritise, what they choose, straight from the evidence.
