The CQC is one of the few organisations to remain following the reforms, but it has been required to implement major changes to its approach to system regulation. The CQC is changing as lessons are learned from examples of poor care such as at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust and Winterbourne View care home and reports into quality and safety of the care delivered by the NHS.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">3.3</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The RCN supports many of the changes being made by the CQC, including the move away from a generic inspector and inspection model. This involves the move to larger inspection teams with a stronger role for nurses and clinicians and also includes patients and members of the public. We are also pleased that the CQC has incorporated listening events into their new acute hospital inspection model, which enables anyone who has received care from the trust being inspected to attend and share their feedback. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">3.4</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">We are less convinced of the merits of the CQC’s proposals for rating all acute hospitals, however. The application of a single rating for an acute hospital, for example, which provides a number of different services, may not provide an accurate reflection of the quality of care across those different services or even on different wards. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">3.5</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Uncertainties also remain in some of the core elements of the CQC’s overall approach to monitoring standards of care. The most notable is the precise fundamental standards that the CQC will focus on, which will be consulted on later this autumn. The fundamental standards will need to ensure that </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">they address what we know can lead to organisational failure, for example, staffing levels and skill mix, organisational culture and management structures.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The CQC will need to translate these into tangible, transparent standards that can be inspected against.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">3.6</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">As was stated in our written submission to the Health Select Committee last year, the CQC also needs to ensure that it continues to meaningfully engage with providers so that they are able to use the results of inspections to make improvements in the care they provide. Professor Don Berwick, in his report on NHS patient safety, made a number of recommendations around transparency and adopting a “culture of learning” within the NHS. The CQC could help to facilitate a culture of openness and candour in those it regulates by ensuring their inspection reports are drafted in such a way that they encourage a </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">‘learning</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> organisation’ to respond appropriately and the lessons learned to be applied across the NHS.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">3.7</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The RCN has approximately 200 members employed in frontline and national roles across the CQC, representing around 10 per cent of the total workforce. We are one of the recognised trade unions within the CQC and RCN representatives continue to meet regularly with CQC management to discuss and negotiate on issues which affect the workforce. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">3.8</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">We remain concerned about the lack of a robust approach to workforce planning within the CQC; how the CQC will transition away from a generic inspector model; and the pressing need to improve learning and development opportunities and support for staff. We have been concerned by the worrying culture of bullying at the CQC which was detailed in the CQC’s July 2013 independent report into bullying and harassment within the organisation. Whilst welcoming the current administration’s acknowledgement of such unsavoury issues, we would now like to see evidence that they are taking action to implement the lessons learned. While we are pleased to see a small improvement in morale in the CQC’s recent staff survey, we are aware that much more needs to be done to enable the CQC to be seen as a role model for the behaviours that it is looking for in those it regulates.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">3.9</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The RCN is pleased that the CQC approached the RCN to ask us for our insight and local intelligence to support their pilot of new style inspections. We are also working on a Memorandum of Understanding between our organisations to provide a framework for more joint work for the future. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">October 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:right"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
