It was a grim experience especially with small daughter and the idea that either the airport </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">or airline had significant numbers of people on the ground is bizarre. If they were there they made a successful effort to make minimal appearances. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">When moved from North to South and later back again, we organised keeping the group together ourselves.

Especially as no one seemed to have thought about the numbers of small children inevitably there. I used to do air travel as Lords Minister so did feel I had a basic grasp of contingencies and have formed a view of 2nd runway idea. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">In </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">the hearing one witness, I think from Easy Jet, said he had stood on a table and addressed the throng. I don’t know if it was him I saw but there was certainly an occasion when a man stood on a table in the Easy Jet area at the far end from where I was. I </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">have no idea how many people were between him and me but a great number. Many were distressed and crying or shouting children. Around me, no one could hear him or had the smallest idea what he was talking about. I suspect that may have been true for most o</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">f the large departure area through which wound the massive queue to the only functioning loo. There appeared to be a loud speaker public address system since it was playing an occasional loop saying how bad the weather had been. I was among many who could </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">not understand why it was not used. I pity the guy who tried if that was the only resource at his disposal which would be hard to believe.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">It is hard to describe the state of the loos in Departures but I haven’t really the language to describe those in Arr</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ivals before they were closed. As I said, the queues were very long indeed. Like me, with a distressed four-year old who simply had to go, many parents took small children to the front of the queue and asked if we might go ahead. The adults were great and </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">realised we had less control over events than they did. But the consequence was plainly that a number of adults waited still longer and were becoming distressed themselves. Two heavily pregnant ladies were letting kids overtake while I was there but were a</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">lso in clear distress. Given the number of staff normally at the airport, I can’t believe there were no other loos and temporary access arrangements possible. If there are not, the airport is woefully unprepared for far more minor events.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">January 2014</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
