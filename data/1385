font-size:12pt">that once again Hampshire County Council had incorrectly upgraded it from its original status as a bridleway, to a Road Used as a Public Path (RUPP) and then in 1987 under WCA 1981 to a BOAT.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';

GLEAM has </span><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">received countless complaints about green lanes being damaged by motor vehicles, to the extent of making walking or cycling impossible, and of rutting which presents a risk putting use by horses out of the question.  Occasions of actual injury have been reported, as have cases of horses being 'spooked' by fast-moving motor vehicles - even to the point of causing fatal injuries to riders.  </span><br /><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></li><li style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Highway authorities have a parallel duty not only to repair rights of way, but also to spend taxpayers' money in a responsible way.

Damage to public paths is not only a criminal offence in itself (a factor normally overlooked by highway authorities) but is also one of the express grounds for imposing a TRO.  Regrettably, authorities commonly adopt a policy of waiting for damage to occur before even considering making a TRO.  It is factors such as these which offer such a compelling case for a right of appeal.  </span><br /><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></li><li style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Failure by an authority to carry out its repair obligations is covered by Sections 56 - 58 of the Act.  There are appeal rights to the magistrates' court, including the matter of costs.</span><br /><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></li><li style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Damage which impairs the use and enjoyment of highways by others is in effect an obstruction.  Sections 130A-D of the Act deal with notices under this heading and also with appeal to the magistrates' court, including the matter of costs. There is no apparent reason why no right of appeal exists in respect of TROs.  Rectifying this defect would fit squarely within the proposals under Clauses 15 - 17 of the Deregulation Bill.  Drafting such a measure would be straightforward, as use could be made of the existing legislation referred to above </span><br /><span style="color:#0d0d0d; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></li><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">On balance the proposal will reduce bureaucracy for the same reason as is given in paragraph 81 of the Notes to the Bill. </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">This </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">states</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> regarding applications for gating orders: </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">"This measure will make it easier for owners to obtain permission to erect gates on byways.
