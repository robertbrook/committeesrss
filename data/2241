The providers are not driven by equality of opportunity and a fair proportion of time dedicated to growing female sports participation. They are generally more concerned about generating the income and the bottom line. The current climate as also resulted in the public sector mentality shifting towards being a more commercially driven animal. In the past leisure centers would have happily provided a badminton court for 4 females. However that would now not happen at the expense of a potential 5 a-side booking that would bring in more income.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">1.5</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">You might think that when performing at an elite level that access to facilities is easier for our elite women athletes.

This resulted in our elite women’s hockey team that consisted of 4 Olympians having to leave the City boundaries and try and establish their routes in the leafy suburbs of the County at the local Grammar School.

Unfortunately the only element that gets anywhere near a debate is the financial purse at Wimbledon for the women’s winner in comparison to that of the men’s winner. The argument regarding the fact the men have to play more sets is ridiculous and this is something that we should be striving to lead the way with and offer the same financial incentives through both the men’s and the women’s draw.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">2.2  </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Prize money is only part of the problem. If you unpick the distribution of public sports funding (Lottery and exchequer) and the equality of distribution amongst sports you will find that female dominated sports like hockey and netball are way down the list in terms of the finances their respective Governing Bodies receive. This is largely due to the fact that their market is harder to reach than the more male dominated sports and they are realistic about the number of participants they can attract. This unfortunately creates a knock on effect to the amount of funding they receive. Greater allowance should be given by Government and Sport England to realise that women like it or not are a harder audience to attract in to sport. Rather than diluting the funding these Governing Bodies receive they should be given more funding due to their market being more difficult.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">2.3</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Sport England’s £500 million worth of funding distributed to Governing Bodies of Sport should have come with some criteria round women’s participation. Instead they have suggested that 60% of this funding needs to be directed towards 16 – 24 year olds playing more sport. This needed to go a step further and suggest that a percentage of the funding should have been focussed on women and girls of this age.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">2.4</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">It raises the question as to whether we need more females in high profile administrative roles when it comes to sport.

Basically you not only have to be elite you have to be the best in the world to attract the interest of commercial sponsorship. This is largely due to the lack of media exposure that women’s sports receive. Sponsoring a female sports star is not going to raise the profile of your brand when TV cameras and newspaper photographers are very really seen anywhere near a hockey or netball fixture even at international level. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">2.5</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">When sponsorship deals do materialise for females it tends to be for the individuals competing in sport and not for team sports.

While participation may be generally the same between boys and girls in early years it does not take long until the problem kicks in.

Mr Gove aside, all political parties would appear in general to want to increase participation, improve competitive opportunities and ensure staff are trained and supported to deliver great PE and sport with suitable extra-curricular provision. A ten-year vision for PE and school sport is needed, a vision that is refreshed every three years as needed. We must continue to fund this area as it will never be sustainable within a school without direction and clarity regarding targets. Certainly cutting PE and school sport funding has had a devastating effect on participation rates in both the curriculum and extra-curriculum sport just in two years. </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">    </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">5.8</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Currently let down by the lack of recognised Government school sport strategy, vision and organisation to drive school sport each and every school will be left to fend for itself. This is extremely worrying in the battle to continue and encourage more girls to participate within sport. The saving grace is organisations like the Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation, The Youth Sports Trust and The Association for Physical Education all of which are hugely experienced in the Physical Education needs of children and young people and in particular girls.    </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">September 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
