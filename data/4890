I will start with you, Sophie. In your written evidence, you state that a codified constitution could be framed so as to ensure that the judiciary has the same attributions and the same constitutional position as at present. What role do you think that the judiciary currently plays in the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> constitutional settlement?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sophie </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Boyron</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: The role of the judiciary for the moment is to respect a certain balance between the various institutions and ensure that some important principles of the constitution are respected. For </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">me, it has both an institutional and substantive role for the moment, and I think it is perfectly possible to inscribe that and protect that from a constitution.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q103 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Tracey Crouch:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Michael, do you agree with that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Gordon</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: Largely. I would probably define their role more specifically in relation to the functions that they currently have. It is an interpretive role in terms of legislation, applying the rules made by Parliament and then using the processes of judicial review to control the actions of the executive, subject them to the rule of law, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">ensure</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> they are behaving lawfully. That power is not static.

I think it is very difficult to know in advance and in the abstract how exactly you could design a codified constitution to preserve exactly this current role for the judiciary because, as I just indicated, I think judicial power is not static. It does change and it is very difficult to identify in advance what other conditions may come into play that may cause the courts to develop their own power in certain ways. Certainly there are indications that they may be willing to do that as part of their responsibility for the development of common law principle. I don’t think it is necessarily obvious how exactly you could preserve their role by, say, stating in a codified constitution that the courts will have the same role for the future as they have now. I think that would be quite difficult to do, and it would be open to them to think about how they might want to interpret that provision as well. I would look to focus instead on defining very clearly the powers of Parliament. Rather than defining the powers of the courts so directly, focus on the powers of Parliament and define their legislative power and allow the role of the courts to be defined by implication.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q105 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Tracey Crouch:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Do you think that by having an unwritten constitution, as we do now, that in itself preserves the constitutional role of the judiciary in its fluidity, flexibility and ultimately progression?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Gordon</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: I think it does to a large extent but an unwritten or an </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">uncodified</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> constitution is still subject to this idea that judicial power is not static and can change and develop over time.

Pre-enactment review looks, on the face of it, to have great benefits and it might work in the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> for several reasons. One is that it would appear to protect parliamentary sovereignty in the sense that it would happen before the statute or an Act of Parliament came officially into effect, so it would look as if it runs less against parliamentary sovereignty in that sense. It was sold like that in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">France</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> when it was first introduced. I think that is just an appearance, not a reality, so I do not buy into that idea. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Secondly, it is believed to be beneficial because the intervention of a court or an advisory body, whatever it is going to be, happens before the Act has any legal effect, which means it will avoid what I would call constitutional damage in the sense that no unconstitutionality will have taken place prior to the Bill being declared to be unconstitutional or incompatible. Those are the advantages. The disadvantages are that it is an abstract review. I am not completely convinced that courts can pick up every single point of incompatibility prior to its having been implemented, and prior to having specific factual situations before the courts. That is my big concern. That is a side issue; any drafting can sort it out of course. Also there is then an issue of how you are going to integrate. If you have only pre-enactment review, that is not a problem, but if you have pre-enactment review and post-enactment review, how those work together can give rise to problems. The court may have said something in the pre-enactment review that might have to be contradicted later, and that does give rise to issues of legal certainty and could give rise to issues of the legitimacy of the judicial process if they end up contradicting each other regularly.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Gordon</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: I agree with that. There do appear to be advantages on the face of it, but, for very similar reasons to Sophie’s, I think it might be a problematic mechanism. It could potentially blur the lines between the legislative process and the adjudicative process in perhaps an unhelpful way. This is speculation but I am not even sure that courts would want this power. Under the devolution legislation, the Supreme Court now has the power to assess whether Acts of the Welsh Assembly, Scottish Parliament and Northern Irish Assembly are within legislative competence in advance on a reference. There has now been a case on it. I know it has been referred to in other evidence. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Maybe I am reading too much into it but there are a couple of stages in those judgments where both Lord Hope and Lord Neuberger seem a little bit reluctant about what is going on, not overtly but they say a few things that appear to be managing the expectations of the different parties involved. They sort of say, “Just because the Secretary of State has lost this case doesn’t necessarily mean it is a defeat because actually you have kind of won at the same time”. Lord Hope goes out of his way to justify the use of the reference procedure and say, “Even though it means that legislation that was perfectly valid already has been delayed in coming into force, hopefully you think it was a useful procedure”. Maybe I read too much into it, but I am not entirely sure the courts are wild about that power anyway, probably for very similar reasons.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sophie </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Boyron</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: The little evidence I have in comparative analysis shows that often it is used for political reasons in the sense of the Opposition stopping an Act of Parliament, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t work. It often is given as a protection for the Opposition or a weapon that the Opposition can use. It does not have to be, you don’t have to draft it like that, but it has been used to that effect. I am not completely convinced that that would fit in with what I understand to be the British constitution as it stands for the moment.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q108 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> To follow up on one of Tracey’s points, isn’t it more helpful to have a pre-emptive stage rather than wait until a law is passed and then the judiciary get involved? Isn’t it sensible at some point to have the ability to consult to see how this might work and if there might be problems and get them out at an early stage?

I would say it is now broadly accepted that there is a stable reconciliation between those two principles. I think there is disagreement about how exactly that reconciliation has been achieved. There is much academic debate about how we have got to the position we are in but I think most people probably accept the endpoint. That in itself has had an impact on the way Parliament thinks about its own power and influenced legislation like the Human Rights Act and the devolution statutes where Parliament sees that it can give power away to some extent without interfering with its sovereignty necessarily. I think it has had an impact on Parliament’s view of its own power there, perhaps even extending that to the European Union Act 2011 as well. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q112 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Browne:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> The EU in all its manifestations.

A topical example is MPs’ pay rises.

That is a micro example but if you get into a written constitution, is there a danger that it all looks fine, it is all codified and then, as the fashions change and you get the ebb and flow of politics, Parliament keeps wanting to do things that it is not allowed to do because of the constitution even though Parliament itself gave its stamp of approval to that very constitution?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Gordon</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: It is a possibility.

We can write rules that might preserve what we want to but we don’t necessarily know how those rules will be understood in 200 years’ time. We can’t guarantee it, which is partly why going down the codified route, if you are interested in preserving parliamentary sovereignty, is probably one that needs to be approached with great caution, I would say.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q116 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Browne:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> But it is possible to reconcile them?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Gordon</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: I think so, yes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q117 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Browne:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> You don’t think that the tension is such that the cracks will ripple through this inflexible document when it is exposed to reality?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Gordon</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: In my mind there would be two models.

This gets to the nub of our ongoing deliberations. What is then the role as you see it for the judiciary when you have a written constitution? There is a slight question as to why you bother going to the effort of getting elected as a Member of Parliament if the judges who have never subjected themselves to any elections at all get to overrule you the whole time. But even if you are not just thinking about yourself and thinking about the interests of your constituents, there is a frustrating sense of having to write back to the constituents saying, “Yes, I do agree with you. What is more, most MPs, as far as I am aware, agree with you but I am afraid we are not able to do anything about it”. There is an issue there about whether democracy is functioning properly. I will get to the question. If you have the rules and the judges are enforcing the rules, there is not any scope for irritating impingement of democracy in the views of elected Members of Parliament because that gets you away from the rigid enforcement of the rules. That seems to me the biggest tension.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Gordon</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: Perhaps, but there is always scope for courts to read extra things in around the rules. A really instructive case in this sense is what has happened in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> in relation to the Scotland Act. The Supreme Court in the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Axa</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Insurance case basically say that in section 29 there is detailed provision as to what the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament should be, but for no reason that was live in the case, as far as I read anyway—there might be debate about that—they also assert a common law jurisdiction that they may need to have the power to review Acts of the Scottish Parliament in exceptional circumstances in the future. So even if you do start defining in relatively detailed terms—and the Scotland Act does define in very detailed terms what legislative competence may be—I am not sure that that can always prevent courts from taking that kind of action to read things in and around the rules.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sophie </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Boyron</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: Can I refine that point? There are two things I want to say with regard to written constitutions. Firstly, having a written constitution does not mean that you won’t have tensions. However clever the drafting is, it is likely that some tensions will occur and we can’t necessary plan for those because that is ball gazing. However, a good constitution should be able to create a framework in which those tensions can survive and be resolved at least temporarily on a certain level. Then you move on and different tensions and different resolutions happen. That is how a constitutional system works, whether it is codified or </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">uncodified</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. That works in codified constitutions so I don’t think that is very specific to codified or </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">uncodified</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> constitutions. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">However, one other point that I wanted to make with regard to the relationship between a codified constitution and courts is that, depending on what codified constitution or type of constitution you are going to adopt, the power of the court should be matched to that. I think that we should not start discussing separately the powers of the court and then match to that whatever the constitution is going to be. It is the other way round. We need to decide what kind of constitution needs to be adopted, whether codified, rigid or what we call a flat constitution, which would not have hierarchy and in that case the role of the courts would be very different.

Courts can find ways out of limits you place on their power. The </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Anisminic</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> case shows that.

I think if you were going to go down that route it would be better just to make reference to the power of Parliament and leave the rest of it to come from implication. If you do start trying to define what the power of the courts is in rules in a way that is absolutely designed to capture things as they are, it is not quite an invitation for them to go and see if they can find clever ways to </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">reimagine</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> those rules but it might be, depending on the culture and background of course.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q125 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Fabian </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Hamilton</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> I would love to know your views on this.

That is what most written constitutions want to do but you could adopt a codified constitution for a range of reasons that are not necessarily oriented towards that. For example, our unwritten constitution is contained in a variety of sources. It is quite confusing, maybe less so now that we have increasing constitutional Acts of Parliament coming through, whatever that means. But one thing you might want to codify for would be to make the thing more accessible and clearer and give the citizens a starting point to try to understand the thing. That would be a perfectly good rationale for codification in my view but it would not necessarily require you to bring in the Bill of Rights, the constitutional power of review for the courts and so on.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q126 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Fabian Hamilton:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Wouldn’t codifying our constitution, or having it in a written form in some way or another, finally end the idea of the royal prerogative and the fact that the Prime Minister is exercising the royal prerogative and the decision-making powers of the monarch, in other words end this idea that it is the monarch who is the supreme source of all authority in this country?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Gordon</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: Absolutely, and I think that would be a very welcome thing for a codified constitution to do in fact, although Acts of Parliament are doing it aside from codification, aren’t they?

We are looking at the constitutional role of the judiciary, not least in the context of moving towards some sort of codification, possibly as a written constitution, but we are exploring those issues. Would any of you gentlemen like to say anything to start off? Are there any particular comments you want to get on the record immediately?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Richard Gordon</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: Could I make one comment, which is that apart from being delighted to be here—it is a privilege to be here, as always—having read the evidence that has been given to this Committee and listened a little bit this morning, I do think that it is important to move perhaps from abstract theory to mechanisms and reality. There is undoubtedly a tension at the moment. However one describes it, there is a tension between the senior judiciary and Parliament. It is not overt and it is not continuous but it can explode. I see some form of framework document, whether you call it a constitution, as part of an incremental process to lessen that tension.

However, a little bit later, I want to chart the trajectory of the apex court—the House of Lords and now the UK Supreme Court, and to see where that is going with or without a written constitution.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q129 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> That is more about what are the legitimate rights of the judiciary vis-à-vis the executive and vis-à-vis the legislature, whatever circumstances.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Murkens</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: Yes. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Picking up on the tension that Richard Gordon just addressed.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q130 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Fundamentally, is it fair, appropriate and just that the judiciary has a power to review or intervene in decisions of the legislature or the executive?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Murkens</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: What we tend to have in mind is US-style striking down of legislation as unconstitutional, but what Professor </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Masterman</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> and I worked out is that there are more subtle ways in which the courts can intervene that are perfectly compatible with our understanding of parliamentary democracy.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Masterman</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: I would echo that and say that, with or without a written constitution, I think one of the valuable exercises that can be gone through here is simply to map what we now regard as legitimate judicial interaction with the powers of both the executive and the legislature.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> I think the Committee is thinking along those lines in the sense that there are many options as we go forward, including just mapping what we have now so that people can understand it.

Nice to see you all. I had better start with a confession. I learned my English legal system from Bill Cornish and my public law from John Griffith at LSE in the very early 1970s and they would have said to me that the landscape had changed a lot as far as the judiciary was concerned over the first seven decades of the 20th century. I suspect from your written evidence, and from Richard’s point about the tension that now exists between the senior judiciary and Parliament, that a lot more has changed even since those times. Politics and </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">judiciary would be old hat I think now. Could you pull those thoughts together to give us a bit of an overview as to what you see are the key changes that have happened in the role of the judiciary? Where we have moved away from that handmaiden to the will of Parliament scenario to the tension scenario—that you rightly refer to, Richard—what are the key milestones for that and what drives that tension? In practical terms, what is the resolution?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Richard Gordon</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: Let me try to give you my very brief thoughts on it. I think there are three chronological milestones. The first is the entry into the European Community, as it then was, in 1972. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Very little happened between 1972 and 1989.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> What did happen in 1989, which coincided with the parallel development of judicial review, was the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Factortame</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> case where for the very first time judges were able to </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">disapply</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Acts of Parliament. That was a direct frontal assault on Parliament by the courts but engendered or triggered not by the judges—indeed the judiciary would have been very reluctant to act in that way—but by the Court of Justice. I don’t think it is totally accidental that it happened four years after the explosion of judicial review in this country. That arose because of an inquiry by the Law Commission in 1985 that reported recommending a streamlined system of public law in this country. Nothing happened for a few years and then we had O’Reilly v </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Mackman</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, Cox v Thanet, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">those</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> sorts of cases. The third development, which was much easier to bring in, the first two having occurred, was the enactment of the Human Rights Act. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">What has been created in those three developments, incrementally as always, is a culture in which the judges are making political decisions. There is no doubt about that, the judges are making political decisions, and Lord </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Sumption</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> made that very point in his recent article. However, the point he did not make and the point I think is of critical importance is that this is a development that has not been triggered by the judiciary. It has been triggered by Parliament, and I think it has been triggered by Parliament without knowing what was happening. How could Parliament have realised that the ECJ would develop its jurisprudence? How could Parliament have seen the culture in which judges were suddenly, in substance if not in theory, overturning Acts of Parliament or provisions of Acts of Parliament? That is the reason for the tensions and I know that judges get upset when they are told, “You are subverting Parliament” because they will say, “No, Parliament created the situation”. What I really want to say is that this is a dynamic that is inescapable unless there is dialogue between Parliament and the judges, not a formalistic dialogue but an informal dialogue. Unless that happens, this problem is going to get much worse.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q132 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Robert Neill:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Do you think the creation of the Supreme Court and the removal from the Upper House has ironically, and probably unintentionally, made that dialogue harder?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Richard Gordon</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: I am afraid it has. In one sense the Blair Government brought in a range of heady constitutional reforms. We must not forget that the creation of the Supreme Court was not anything other than a really political decision and the dynamics of that decision are themselves interesting. But what it has actually created is a loss of influence by judges in parliamentary affairs in the name of separation of powers. There is a real loss there because judges used to understand at the most senior level how Parliament worked. Now that influence is fast diminishing and that is why I think the need for dialogue is even more important that it has ever been.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Masterman</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: I would add only one thing to the list of milestones that Richard Gordon has already outlined and that would be the devolution legislation of 1998. Even though we know that decisions involving disputes around the competence of the devolved Administrations vis-à-vis the Westminster Parliament are relatively few and far between, this is still adding an intra-jurisdictional territorial dynamic to the powers of the courts that was previously unknown in this jurisdiction.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Murkens</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: I can only echo that. My answer could be used to create a broader perspective, which is that in a living constitution—and assuming that we all understand the constitution to be a living thing whether it is written or not—the role of the court will inevitably and naturally change as part of that process. This is true also in the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. In the infamous </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Dred</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Scott decision of the late 19th century the US Supreme Court treated an escaped slave as property that had to be returned to his rightful owner. In the infamous </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Lochner</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> decision in 1905 the US Supreme Court developed a substantive notion of due process in order to strike down progressive legislation as unconstitutional. That is the same court that after World War II desegregated schools in Brown and legalised abortion in Roe v Wade. The US Supreme Court has changed along with the American constitution, the German Constitutional Court has changed since its inception in 1952, and of course the UK courts at all levels have changed. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The end of World War II is probably a good starting point and the famous </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Wednesbury</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> case that gave us our modern version of judicial review of Government action in this country is not the same basis for judicial review any more. It is formally the basis but it has been added to and expanded over time. Just to complete this thought, there is an irony potentially that this is a parliamentary committee trying to map out the current and future powers of the senior judiciary and I would like to know what the senior judiciary think of this exercise, going back to a separation of powers and judicial independence type principle.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q133 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> You would like to know what they </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">think?</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> We have been to visit the Supreme Court, so I just put that in as a matter of fact and we will continue to do that, but as people have rightly commented I do not think it is anything to do with the fact that they do not meet in the House of Lords. They are all still Lords. There are many other Lords who have a judicial background, so I think Richard has entered a note of controversy there. But it is absolutely clear that people in the judiciary do not want to be seen to be visibly and publicly interacting either with the executive or with Parliament. At one level I think that is a shame but I think the way we get around that is by having informal discussions and doing the sort of meetings that we did with the President of the Supreme Court, which we must continue to do as a committee if our work is to have the evidence base that is so important.

You said the American Supreme Court had changed, but is that strictly right or is it actually that the composition of the court had changed, essentially? A much more socially conservative group of judges had been replaced by a far more broad-minded and socially liberal group of judges, ironically as the result of political action because of appointments by the President, confirmed by Congress. You might say that is an example of a politicised court changing in its way. Its constitutional powers and its jurisprudence have reflected its political philosophy.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Murkens</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: I don’t disagree with you.

I don’t think that is the case currently, although I was thinking about this question before coming here. By political I mean I don’t think we will see a case like Roe v Wade or Bush v Gore in the UK Supreme Court. A challenge for the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> court may be assisted suicide and after last year’s decision in the Tony </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Nicklinson</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> case I think this is a question that may come back to court. From a legal perspective or constitutional perspective, I think the courts rightly said that this was a question for Parliament to decide but that is the cut-off point where the judges say, “This is not a legal question for us to decide. It is a political question for Parliament to decide”. I think this question and similar questions may come back to the UK Supreme Court, raising questions about its nature.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q136 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Robert Neill:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Roger and Jo, in your written evidence you state that the UK Supreme Court can be seen to discharge some of the functions of a constitutional court. You are quoting Lord Phillips in his lecture broadly around that, aren’t you? You classify them into two kinds. One is those that Richard referred to where there has been a specific delegation by Parliament, more or less intended, which has given the court a role that is then asserted and filled. Then you talk in your paper about a second type, which is the common law constitution idea and you make reference to Simms, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Anisminic</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> and so on. The point is clearly made in the first case, I think—Richard has already articulated it—but can you expand a bit more on the second? Might that second in particular, where this is not Parliament having delegated but the judges asserting and Simms and Lord Hoffmann speak, for example, be seen as an example of where you are saying the courts will wriggle out of attempts to control their power? Could you expand on that a bit?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Richard Gordon</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: Could I give a few thoughts on that? I haven’t written about it but Jo and Roger have. There is nothing sacrosanct about the common law. Historically it was one of many systems of law. It grew up to its position of power through a degree of political assertion on the part of the judges. It trumped equity in the end. So the common law has come to have a kind of mystical significance in the language of the judiciary that it has not always had. I think that the way our constitution operates, and I think will always operate whether you have a written constitution, codified constitution or anything, is by recognition—Hart would call it rules of recognition—among the three organs of state. In other words, Parliament, the executive and the judiciary rub along in an informal way knowing the proper bounds. They know how far they can go to—or do they?—but broadly they want to know how far they can go. This echoes something I think Graham said a bit earlier. You need to know what the rules of the game are, and Parliament itself, committees of Parliament, are in danger of sometimes breaking the rules. I don’t accuse this Committee of that but there are one or two committees that are acting in a way that is causing concern within Parliament. I have written about select committees. If there was a framework of rules I think that would happen, which is why I think a framework document—I wouldn’t necessarily call it a constitution—would be a good idea so that we knew the basic rules. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">You are quite right to say, I think, that Parliament has not delegated some of the common law documents that are coming out. However, you should remember that in a case like Simms—and Pierson is another one—the principle of legality is not some freestanding common law doctrine. It is a principle of statutory interpretation but the judges have created it. So there is that tension there and that is why again I think one needs to be very careful. If you regard the constitution as power players jostling for amity or comity, the power word of the judges is the common law. We saw that recently in John Laws’ lecture, the Hamlyn Lecture. The power word of Parliament is parliamentary sovereignty, although actually it is executive sovereignty. By all means keep the language, but one does need to keep one’s feet on the ground and not regard parliamentary sovereignty as the only card in the deck. It may be the trump card but it is sometimes quite dangerous to start producing trump cards. One has to get along with all players in the state.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q137 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Robert Neill:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> One might say that one of the problems in that relationship is precisely that parliamentary sovereignty in practice means executive sovereignty and it might be easier to have a tripartite arrangement where there was a real distinction in the framework.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Richard Gordon</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: That is what I believe we should have. I think there is a great danger when the executive starts pulling out trump cards. With great respect to the Secretary of State for Justice, he is pulling out a trump card at the moment, precisely in the area of judicial review, with reforms that the senior judiciary and lawyers are very troubled by. He can say this is parliamentary sovereignty, but it is going further than any Government has ever done before and that is when things begin to become destabilised.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q138 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Robert Neill:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> That is the context in which you envisage the framework document that you talk about?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Richard Gordon</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: Exactly.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Robert Neill:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Jo and Roger?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Murkens</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: I think your question goes to the heart of the question that Roger and I are interested in.

The alternative, which is similarly unsatisfactory, goes back to this common law romanticism that Richard Gordon spoke about, which is to say that the judges essentially take the law into their own hands and </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">disapply</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> the statute or strike it down and impose their own values on those of Parliament.

It shows both the brilliance and the powerlessness of the courts in many respects because it shows that the common law is able to incrementally develop to the extent that it can purport to place limitations on Parliament’s ability to legislate freely, albeit limitations expressed through the interpretative power of the courts, but also at the same time maintains the parliamentary sovereignty that the clear language of the statute that does not admit of any ambiguity is still sacrosanct. It shows this tension at its best, perhaps, because it shows that the courts are conscious of their overriding role to vindicate the rule of law but know also that this needs to be balanced against the democratic imperative in parliamentary legislation.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q139 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Robert Neill:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Given that you say it already covers some of the functions of the Supreme Court, if you went down a codification route—I take Richard’s point that you might not need to do that if you have a framework document—where are the further areas beyond that specific one where there is parliamentary delegation and so on?

Where I think the judiciary will react badly is if they perceive their power to be slipping. If they perceive their power, whether it be a constitution or simple executive acts of Parliament, to be diminishing vis-à-vis the executive and Parliament I think you will get the kind of legislative techniques we have seen and referred to earlier, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Anisminic</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, reading down statutes in evocation of the common law. In that context, the rule of law is such an abstract concept that Parliament has not even currently attempted to define it, but there are two versions of the rule of law. One is the thin version and the other is the thick version. I am assuming members of this Committee will have been filled in on that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> We will come to that in a little while, Richard. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Richard Gordon</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: But just to say that the thin version is often the language of the executive and the thick version is often the language of the judges.

The judiciary for the most part have a very broad conception of the rule of law and different judges have different conceptions, but the thick version is effectively, as Sir Sydney </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Kentridge</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> has termed it, the rule of justice. The jurist Ronald </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Dworkin</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> would have said judges themselves are responsible for developing substantive principles of justice. The thin version is the version that simply says that provided a law is enacted and there is conformity with the law then the rule of law is satisfied. The problem with the thin version of the rule of law is that it undoubtedly allows for the executive to exempt itself from it, because if you pass a law that exempts the executive and comply with that law you are of course complying with the rule of law in that sense. There is, however, a third version of the rule of law that is neither thick nor thin but which one might call populist or </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Daily Mail</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> and often invoked by Government for no doubt popular support. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">My feeling is that there needs to be dialogue about what really should be fashioned in terms of a societal consensus or, if you like, consensus between the organs of state, as to what we really do mean when we talk about the rule of law. This can’t be done in any formal way but if it was done in an informal way so that parliamentarians got an idea of where the judges were really coming from—it is difficult because we have had four lectures recently from judges and two of them have </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">said completely different things. John Laws, for example, believes so strongly in the common law that, although he ends up by saying we don’t have to follow Strasbourg, he is really saying that the judges hold the whip hand, whereas </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Sumption</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> is saying completely the opposite and saying you don’t have to follow Strasbourg because it is going beyond the text of the convention, that actually a lot of the questions that judges are deciding are political questions and they should not have to decide these questions.

It is not a juristic concept at all. It is just that a lot of the public can’t understand what our courts are doing. The judges would defend it by saying, “We are simply applying the rule of law, the rule of justice, we are applying the European Convention”, whatever it might be, and Parliament, or rather the executive, I think would say, “You are going too far”. I don’t think the executive would go as far as the populist conception but I think the executive is much closer to the thin version of the rule of law than the thick version.

The rule of law is not a rule and it is not always about law but it is a constitutional principle. It is an aspiration, it is an ideal and it is an ideal for Government, the ideal that the Government has to act according to law. It cannot act in an arbitrary way. It is also an ideal for law, which means that when Parliament enacts law substantively it is without legal limits. Parliament can enact legislation on any topic it likes but, according to the rule of law, the laws that Parliament enact have to be clear, precise, especially in criminal law forward looking, not retrospective, those kind of formal standards that parliamentary legislation has to meet. The problem with that, as is also well known, is that any self-respecting dictator can satisfy the formal precepts of the rule of law. The apartheid system, for instance, made sure that its laws were accessible, clear and forward looking. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The problem that Roger and I have with the thin conception of the rule of law is that we don’t see how it operates in a democracy or how it makes a material difference to a Western liberal </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">democracy that we imagine the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">United Kingdom</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> to be. When I earlier referred to the courts’ democratic conception of the rule of law, we are drawing on dicta by judges in the House of Lords and the Supreme Court but also in lectures where they have said we need to hold parliamentary legislation to a slightly higher account or slightly higher benchmark than just is it clear, is it precise, is it forward looking, but also is it compatible with a Western liberal democracy, whatever that means. That is a slightly different question than the formal questions that we have tended to ask in the past.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Masterman</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: I agree with Jo, obviously. The point that Richard makes is an excellent one and well made, because the difficulty, of course, of trying to argue that the courts’ role is to vindicate this thing called the rule of law is that the rule of law ends up just being an empty vessel into which individual judges’ perceptions and views of what society should look like are poured. Another kind of core aim of any initiative like this should be to unpack what we mean by these statements. Nobody doubts that </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Entick</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> v Carrington is good law, nobody doubts that the rule of law is a constitutional fundamental, but there is considerable doubt as to what the term actually means, what it requires in practice, even if you go beyond simply outlining the kind of procedural and maybe substantive characteristics of what something called the rule of law would require. What are the consequences if those requirements are not satisfied? Do you then go down the alleyway that says that judges should be able to strike down legislation that contravenes these standards, or are we talking about something slightly different?

If the Government introduced into </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Parliament</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> a Bill that infringed a fundamental right, whereas in the United States and in France these constitutional controls are extra-</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">parliament</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">ary—whether it be the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Conseil</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Constitutionnel</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> in France or the US Supreme Court in America—in Britain the controls are intra-</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">parliament</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">ary. I think Lord Lester explained this in his evidence here. Under section 19 the Minister has to declare that the Bill is incompatible with the Human Rights Act. There is the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights. There is the Lords Constitution </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Committee</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. They would all be looking at this Bill and saying, “We have a problem, what is the Government going to do about it?” This is also a defence of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">parliament</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">ary sovereignty rather than executive dominance because the Government still has to work through </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Parliament</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> in order to get legislation passed. Can the Government, if it really wants to, get the Bill through? Yes, we know that it can, but there is also an orderly </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">parliament</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">ary process</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Richard Gordon</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: Can I just expand on that? What Jo is saying is in a different way exactly what I have tried to say, which is that </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Parliament</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> can do anything it wants provided it can practically achieve it. So it can’t remove Canadian independence but it could certainly withdraw from the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">European</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Convention, and that is what may happen if one party gets in next time. It would be a manifesto commitment. But I am afraid the problem is that it will be perceived by a large section of the organs of state as going too far, I think, in the sense that there is very strong support for the progress we have made since enacting the Human Rights Act. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">To give you a graphic example, when I went to </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Singapore</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> a year ago I looked at their constitution and I also looked at the cases that have been brought before their courts and talked to the Attorney General’s chambers. Oddly enough when I got back from </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Singapore</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> I was briefed by the leader of the Opposition and I said to him that he had a strong case that he was bound to lose.

Statistically you have no hope whatever”. That is a different legal culture, but the point is that all the rules in Singaporean administrative law, you could go back in this country 30, 40 years and they were our rules: ultra </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vires</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, the dominant principle, and so on. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">I think shifting from the convention would send a huge political signal to the Council of Europe members; it would endanger our relationship with the EU and it would cause a constitutional destabilisation.

There is no doubt about that. My point is that holding the trump card in a constitution such as we have is not enough.

I think there are problems with references. I also happen to think there are problems with simply striking down legislation and I do not think it is solved remedially by prospective declarations, which have caused all sorts of problems in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Hong Kong</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, for example.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">My current thinking, having started off as a huge advocate of a classic codified </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">constitution</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, is to say it should all be done incrementally.

It will happen at some stage, maybe 100 years down the line, but you have to do these things incrementally.

So it is the mechanism that arguably in theory allows for this dialogue, allows for </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">a collaboration</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> between the branches of government, that does not necessarily result in one always having a trump card to play.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Murkens</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: This dialogue is not just a matter of institutional comity; it is a matter of necessity because of the breadth of law. If we think about this, when </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Parliament</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> legislates, it legislates for the nation. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Parliament</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> is the forum of the nation. It cannot ever anticipate all the individual repercussions that will emerge somewhere down the line. That is for the courts to solve. The courts are there to protect individual justice. That bias is ingrained in the judicial system. When the courts say that we have an issue here with individual justice that has emerged further down the line and </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">that therefore shines a negative light on the integrity of the statute as a whole, the judges have to have some mechanism in which to say a </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">constitution</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">al issue has arisen.

I have not yet worked out what I think is good mechanism. But you must have judicial insight somewhere in the way in which legislation is framed and applied. Whether that insight comes pre-enactment, which I think is in many ways desirable, or in the courts afterwards, you simply cannot rely upon the written word—and legislation is now incredibly complex—to say we have resolved all problems. However ingenious the draftsman, there are always going to be problems and individual situations. There is always going to be a need for an exception. Somebody mentioned earlier today the need for executive discretion. There is also a need for a residual judicial flexibility. But if the judges apply judicial flexibility in one area, because of our doctrine of precedent they may apply it in an area that upsets the executive. These are problems. They are genuine issues and I do not think they can be resolved by an abstract solution. I think it has to be incremental and hopefully crystallising into </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">some kind of document that lays down a broad framework of rules.

It seems to go on and on and there seems to be lots of different interpretations whereas perhaps the Germans have been a bit clearer than we have, I don’t know.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Murkens</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: The premise is a little different. The Germans have always been concerned with upholding the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">sovereignty</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> of their </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">constitution</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, and this does indeed go back to the 1970s because the German </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">constitution</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> includes a catalogue of basic rights. The </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Constitution</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">al Court looked at the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">European</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Community of the 1970s and found human rights protection to be lacking and therefore said, “If we are going to give effect to community law it will have to be compatible with our </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">constitution</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">” and hence the human rights dimension. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The British courts, or the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">United Kingdom</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, in comparison is more concerned with </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">parliament</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">ary </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">sovereignty</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> and who has the final word in that. That is a content-neutral debate. It is more about the locus of power rather than the content of legislation.

I suspect the answer is pretty obvious, but if you were to create be it a </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">constitution</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, be it a framework document, that said there shall be a form of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">constitution</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">al court, however you dress it up, do you think by now there is enough expertise and awareness of the issues entrenched in the current Supreme Court to make that fairly easy to move over into that form?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Richard Gordon</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: I think it would be very easy to do it but I think it would send out all sorts of signals. When I wrote my book on the Crown Office—this is when the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">judicial</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> review was just beginning—I had to have each chapter vetted because it was not allowed to contain any reference to an administrative court, it being thought that if you did that you would be assaulting Dicey, who said that all our courts dealt with the same law. It was only quite recently that we called it the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Administrative Court</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. There was a lot of sensitivity about that. So I think if you called it a </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">constitution</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">al </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">court, that</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> might send signals now. We do not need to do it but it would be very easy to do, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">given</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> the current experience of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">constitution</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> and so on.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Masterman</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: I agree. Asking a </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">constitution</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">al court comprised perhaps of some of the judges, maybe even the same judges, as we have in the Supreme Court at the moment would cause no great problems whatsoever, but maybe the difficulty would arise in the label.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> So, let us stick with Supreme.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Murkens</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: Can I just add one maybe related thought? My worry about </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">constitution</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">al reform is summed up with this notion of tinkering with the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">constitution</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. I think introducing </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">constitution</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">al reform piecemeal, like creating a supreme court or creating a </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">constitution</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">al court, or introducing an alternative vote system in the electoral process, without thinking about the implications or taking the bigger picture into account, is potentially dangerous because it creates unintended consequences and knock-on effects that are not immediately clear. So again I would think about the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">constitution</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">al picture </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">as a whole rather than individual aspects</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> of it. It is beyond your remit I think.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> But it is not beyond our intellectual capabilities. Some of us may appear to be piecemeal but still have a master plan in mind. Others of us botch along depending on what the political winds are and what expedience can deliver for us. I am not sure in which camp I or my </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Committee</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> sit but I can guarantee you that we will do the best we can. Since we are much better informed after this morning, I think we will do a reasonable job at the end of the day. Roger, Jo, Richard, thank you so much.
