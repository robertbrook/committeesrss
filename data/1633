Consequently, significant resources are being given to strategic transport projects and to the provision of road and rail infrastructure. Beyond Local Sustainable Transport Funding (which has been most welcome), Department for Transport initiatives for local public transport have been biased towards urban areas (such as Better Bus Areas and Green Bus Fund). Unfortunately, rural areas have not had the attention they deserve. Equally, as budgets for supporting local bus services are cut back, rural areas suffer more, as a greater proportion of services in rural areas are supported than in urban areas.    </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Issues for public transport in Herefordshire</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Herefordshire has a traditional pattern of conventional bus services, which radiate out from </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Hereford</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> to the surrounding market towns and operate on regular frequencies (mainly hourly).

Equally, it is important to avoid diluting what services provide (i.e. trying to serve so many different communities that routes become convoluted and slow, and service patterns become overly complex and poorly understood).</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Understanding the market and working with it is crucial in achieving this balance. Therefore, building good working relationships with bus operators is important. In moving towards the provision of a primary network with feeder services, it is intended that more passengers will be fed into </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">commercial services to help maintain them as viable operations and hopefully encourage further investment by operators.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Working with all types of providers is necessary. Hence encouragement is being given to the community transport sector to play a greater role. The challenge here is supporting schemes to build capacity and capability.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">4.  Community transport</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Community transport can play an important part in the overall picture. Currently, the operators in Herefordshire tend to be focused on meeting the needs of particular groups (such as older and disabled people), or on providing particular types of journeys (such as medical). Schemes are generally small scale with limited vehicle and staff resources; for example, each offers quite limited office opening hours for bookings. Consequently, they have limited interest in broadening their horizons, such as the operation of contracts (school and / or social care transport).</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">There are significant opportunities for community transport in the future. However, new ways of thinking will need to be adopted. In general, we are seeking to encourage schemes to become involved in more general transport service provision, complementing the main bus network, rather than just providing for specific needs. One scheme has already adopted the ‘feeder service’ concept. Where users are able to use public transport, the voluntary car scheme will pick them up from home and take them to / from the bus stop, to complete their journey by bus, rather than convey them by car for the full journey.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">One scheme is starting to recruit new types of volunteers, such as people who work during the week, but want to do some voluntary activities at the weekend. This has enabled the scheme to offer its voluntary car service on a Saturday as well as weekdays.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">We are currently working with the community transport sector as a whole to encourage schemes to collaborate with regards to bookings for transport, such that by working together they can extend the times when enquiries and bookings can be taken.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">5.  Taxis / DRT</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">In rural areas, more flexible types of transport have to be part of the solution. Certainly, the Council is dependent on taxi and private hire operators to provide journeys to school and for social care purposes. Therefore, these vehicles are a resource that can be exploited to offer complementary public transport, such as in providing feeders to the core network. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">As time goes on, the relevance of once-per-week market day only buses will diminish. This will provide the opportunity to introduce more demand responsive services. It will be crucial to co-ordinate the provision of all types of small vehicle and specialist transport services (social care, school, medical patients, community transport etc) to ensure efficiencies and economies of scale are achieved. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">6.  Challenges of funding</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Funding to provide services that meet the many demands is decreasing. Therefore, it is vital to achieve the best use of all resources through co-ordination; either by achieving greater utilisation of vehicles or by amalgamating passenger demands. Avoiding duplication of activities by co-ordinating with other organisations will be important. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">In order to minimise calls on the Council to support services, the aim must be to maintain as much of the transport network as commercially viable. As described earlier, the aim of developing rural hubs on key corridors (into which feeder services operate and which offer park and ride) is part of the strategy to achieve this. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">September 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
