Assuming we have successfully met this target by the end of 2014, during which period we will also have introduced case examiners, we envisage proposing to Council a new KPI of 90 per cent of cases progressed within 15 months. This would bring us in line with the performance of the other healthcare regulators, which are managing significantly smaller caseloads. We are happy to propose a start to end target of 15 months rather than targets for individual stages in response to the Committee’s observation that what matters to complainants and registrants is the overall time taken.</span></p><p style="line-height:14pt; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Any further significant reduction in the overall length of the FtP cases will only be achievable if the Law Commission’s proposed reforms are enacted and provide a more flexible framework with alternatives to full hearings.

It stipulates that these should take place after the recognition of the qualification, but before access to the profession. The GMC has a licence to practise as well as a register, so it can meet European expectations by registering an EU doctor and then looking at the issue of language skills before granting a licence to practise.

In this year’s performance review report, the PSA express concern that although public protection is the ‘litmus test’ against which all your work is measured, you have not yet identified measures to tell you whether or not that test has been passed. How do you know, and how can we know, that you are protecting the public?</span></p><p style="line-height:14pt; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="line-height:14pt; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The statement that public protection is our ‘litmus test’ originates with our response to the strategic review by the PSA, which was to review all workstreams and cease work which may have been popular with different constituencies but did not make a sufficient contribution to public protection. In other words, the first improvement step was to ensure that all of our work was squarely about public protection.</span></p><p style="line-height:14pt; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="line-height:14pt; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The PSA is quite right that the next step is to be able to measure the difference we make to public protection, because we need to know the impact of our work as a publicly accountable body and because we need to understand our impact in order to improve as a regulator. Measuring impact is a challenging area for all regulators because it is difficult to isolate the effect of regulation on patient safety from the effects of local policies, employment practices, training, and so on. But we can get better at identifying intermediate measures, such as testing what nurses and midwives understand the code to require of them on a topic, and use that learning to inform improvements.</span></p><p style="line-height:14pt; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="line-height:14pt; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Some of our current KPIs do speak to whether we are protecting the public, particularly those that relate to getting the right people on and off the register, or, in the case of interim orders, preventing or limiting the practice of registrants whose fitness to practise is called into question.</span></p><p style="line-height:14pt; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="line-height:14pt; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">For some other regulatory functions we acknowledge we have more ‘input’ measures than ‘outcome’ ones.

Our powers in this area are to set standards for nurses and midwives and that is why our code provides clear messages about our registrants’ oversight of and ultimate responsibility for work they delegate to others.</span></p><p style="line-height:14pt; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Revalidation</span></p><p style="line-height:14pt; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">10.

We are in discussions with the DH about our concerns however and we hope to clarify and mitigate issues as part of the transposition process. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Five areas of concern for the NMC arising from amendments to the Directive are:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">EU Professional Card</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> – The European Professional Card is being introduced by the Directive and would be an electronic form of recognition. It would be operated through the NMC linking with the Internal Market Information Systems (IMI) operated by the European Commission, through which applications for registration would be transacted. We have significant concerns about the impact of the card both in terms of cost and the fact that it places greater responsibility and power over recognition with the regulator in the nurse or midwife’s home member state. Thus it would constrain the NMC’s ability to impose checks on who enters its own register. We have additional concerns about the process by which the Commission is engaging with stakeholders to discuss the card, which to date has not included regulators who would be expected to operate any new system.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Partial Access to the Register</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> – Where an applicant’s qualifications have such shortfalls that they cannot be made up by compensation measures (for example through a period of adaptation), a new provision in the Directive would allow for partial access to the profession. This is a clear public safety risk. Safeguards have now been put in place in the Directive and most nurses and midwives will not be covered by this new requirement. However we remain concerned that a small group of nurses and midwives would be subject to this requirement and the NMC may thus face legal challenge from a migrant. We hope to mitigate this risk as part of the transposition and will hold discussions with the DH on this issue.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Alert Mechanism</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> – The amended Directive will require the NMC to inform all other regulators in the EU and upload (via the EU’s IMI system) all our fitness to practise decisions in a condensed timeframe.

As the NMC deals with the largest number of fitness to practise cases this will also put pressure of IMI and recipient member states.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 54pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Language testing</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> – as set out in our response to Q.5 above</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Temporary provision of services </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">– the NMC continues to be concerned that nurses and midwives are able to travel to the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> and provide services on a temporary basis without registration.
