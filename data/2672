This is because there is no consistency in local planning policies. One council will have a 20% carbon reduction from </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">renewables</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> policy, and the next local authority will have no carbon reduction policy, but insists on Code 4. Builders are struggling to develop a standard house type working drawing portfolio when there is such an inconsistency of planning policies around the country. Mandatory levels of the code will solve this problem. Developers are now fully aware of the code requirements, understand the costs involved, and can include the non-mandatory elements to suit their budget and expertise.</span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.17pt; padding-left:3.83pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The Code requirements are what developers ought to be building to as a matter of course, &amp; therefore shouldn’t affect the ‘Red Tape’. The supply of new homes is mainly affected by demand and the availability of mortgages (low interest rate and high percentage).
