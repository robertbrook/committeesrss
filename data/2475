Grayling claims the proposals wo</span><span style="color:#42210b; font-family:Georgia; font-size:10pt">uld save the country £220 million a year by 2018-2019, although it is unclear what that estimate is based on.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#42210b; font-family:Georgia; font-size:10pt">“These changes would undermine accountability and people’s ability to exercise their rights,” Ward said. “Whatever their impact on public spendin</span><span style="color:#42210b; font-family:Georgia; font-size:10pt">g, their damage to the rule of law is too high a price to pay.”</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#42210b; font-family:Georgia; font-size:10pt">The proposed changes have drawn widespread criticism. More than 43,000 people have signed a petition to the justice minister opposing the cuts. The Law Society, which represents solicitors, h</span><span style="color:#42210b; font-family:Georgia; font-size:10pt">as called the proposals “economically unworkable and possibly unlawful.” The chairman of the Bar Council has warned that the proposed changes will cause “irreversible damage” to the justice system. A former senior judge has said the reforms will be “absolu</span><span style="color:#42210b; font-family:Georgia; font-size:10pt">tely devastating for the justice system as we know it,” and that “they will lead to many problems, certainly to miscarriages of justice.” Ninety senior barristers who specialize in judicial review have called on the government to withdraw those proposals, </span><span style="color:#42210b; font-family:Georgia; font-size:10pt">saying they would grant the government and other public authorities immunity from effective legal challenge.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#42210b; font-family:Georgia; font-size:10pt">One of the most controversial changes would be the price tendering system, awarding contracts to firms offering the lowest price, and denying clie</span><span style="color:#42210b; font-family:Georgia; font-size:10pt">nts any choice in who represents them. Under the proposals, cases could be allocated effectively at random instead of to lawyers with expertise in a particular issue. The proposed introduction of a residence test for civil legal aid is also very worrying, </span><span style="color:#42210b; font-family:Georgia; font-size:10pt">Human Rights Watch said. Under this requirement, only those who have lived in the country lawfully and continuously for at least 12 months at some stage in their life would be eligible. This would exclude many among the most vulnerable, including women fle</span><span style="color:#42210b; font-family:Georgia; font-size:10pt">eing from abuse and children who are victims of trafficking. British nationals who return from overseas and have not lived in the UK continuously for 12 months would also be affected.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#42210b; font-family:Georgia; font-size:10pt">In addition, those granted asylum would have to wait for 12 months befo</span><span style="color:#42210b; font-family:Georgia; font-size:10pt">re they could bring a new civil or family law case. Failed asylum seekers would be excluded from legal aid altogether, even if they cannot go back to their country because they would be at risk of torture or other ill-treatment there.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#42210b; font-family:Georgia; font-size:10pt">The proposal, says t</span><span style="color:#42210b; font-family:Georgia; font-size:10pt">he government, would “ensure that legal aid would continue to be available where necessary to comply with obligations under EU [European Union] or international law.” In fact, EU and international law require the UK to ensure the right to an effective reme</span><span style="color:#42210b; font-family:Georgia; font-size:10pt">dy, which is key in enabling people to enforce their human rights. If the UK makes these changes, it risks breaching these obligations, Human Rights Watch said.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#42210b; font-family:Georgia; font-size:10pt">The proposed changes would also significantly curb legal aid for judicial review. Under judici</span><span style="color:#42210b; font-family:Georgia; font-size:10pt">al review, people can challenge decisions by the government or public bodies that affect them. It allows people to hold the government to account.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#42210b; font-family:Georgia; font-size:10pt">Under the proposals, people seeking judicial review who do not satisfy the residence test would be ineligibl</span><span style="color:#42210b; font-family:Georgia; font-size:10pt">e for legal aid, as would be those seeking to challenge their treatment in prison. The proposals would also remove legal aid for “borderline cases,” in which it is not possible to determine whether they would have a 50 percent or more chance of success bec</span><span style="color:#42210b; font-family:Georgia; font-size:10pt">ause of disputed law, fact, or expert evidence.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#42210b; font-family:Georgia; font-size:10pt">People seeking to bring complex cases, including those relating to a breach of their rights under the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) and asylum cases would no longer be eligible for legal aid if they</span><span style="color:#42210b; font-family:Georgia; font-size:10pt"> are considered “borderline.”</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#42210b; font-family:Georgia; font-size:10pt">Those who are ineligible for legal aid will be left with the choice of representing themselves in complex proceedings against government-funded lawyers, or not bringing a case at all.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#42210b; font-family:Georgia; font-size:10pt">“The whole idea of legal aid is to make </span><span style="color:#42210b; font-family:Georgia; font-size:10pt">the system fairer for people who can’t afford to pay for representation, but the government’s proposals would do just the opposite” Ward said. “The government should listen to the objections and take them to heart.”</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; line-height:21pt; margin:6pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/06/04/united-kingdom-halt-attacks-legal-aid</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">September 2013</span></p></div></body></html>
