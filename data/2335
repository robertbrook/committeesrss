Thus, “targeted killings” as typically understood (intentional and premeditated killings) cannot be lawful under international human rights law, because this allows intentional lethal force only when necessary to protect against a threat to life, and where there are no other means of preventing that threat to life. There is little public evidence that the targeted killings carried out fulfil this strict legal test. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">The US is not involved in an "armed conflict" with either of these states.  </span><span style="font-family:Arial;
