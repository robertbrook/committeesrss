There is concern that the Crown Estate continues to grant leases for aquaculture, in particular salmon f</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">ish farms, without due consideration for sustainability of ecosystems in pristine locations, and in areas where wild salmon run.</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> This damages small marine communities dependent on tourism of many sorts.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">The prime concern remains the ease with which finfis</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">h farming is being granted approval by local authorities either for enlargement or new sites. Objections by stakeholders are ignored. Of particular concern are the mammoth farms being proposed, both in sea lochs and more open water. The model for “dilute a</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">nd disperse assimilation of faecal, chemical and food waste” is inadequate. It appears most local councillors have insufficient ecological and chemical knowledge to make a balanced judgement of the planning application; and further, and most disappointedly</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">, SEPA and SNH are not following any Precautionary Principle as advocated under the MSFD and GES. Whilst I do understand for regulatory reasons the Crown Estate has passed the role of making a judgement and delivering a ruling on to planning committees of </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">local authorities in Scotland, it still grants the leases, so retains the power to question.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Some local a</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">uthorities are being persuaded by the salmon companies not to insist on an EIA.
