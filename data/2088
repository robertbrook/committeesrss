In doing so the Committee has limited its response to aspects of the draft Deregulation Bill that relate to insolvency matters, namely Clauses 9 and 11 and Schedule 5. Before looking at those specific sections, the Committee should point out that it is fully supportive of the policy behind the measures which are designed to remove unnecessary burdens on businesses, individuals and public bodies alike. Now taking each of the specific insolvency related measure in turn:</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Authorisation of insolvency Practitioners (Clause 9)</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The stated aim of this provision is to increase accessibility and improve competition between insolvency practitioners. We expect that you will hear directly from insolvency practitioners as interested parties in this part of the Bill.  We therefore limit our comments to some general observations, namely that by introducing a tiered system of authorisations, it may in fact be more expensive for those regulating insolvency practitioners to operate and monitor.  It may also make it more difficult for those entering into the market, who will have to specify at an early stage which aspects they are to focus on, putting them at a disadvantage to those who are already authorised to act and will be fully authorised.   It may also have the effect of discouraging competition, for example, in that corporate insolvency work remains the preserve of very large practices.  Whilst we appreciate that the proposals are made with the aims of lowering the costs of training and ongoing regulation for those wishing to specialise, it would be unfortunate if that narrowing of expertise could also potentially result in a lowering of standards at the entry level, which would not benefit the industry.        </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Insolvency and company law: miscellaneous (Clause 11) and Schedule 5</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">This clause simply refers to the operative provisions which are set out in Schedule 5 and are divided into seven parts.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Part 1: Deeds of Arrangement</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> We agree that the Deeds of Arrangement Act 1914 should be repealed and serves little practical purpose.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Part 2: Administration of companies</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Paragraph 5 – This change provides clarification as to the prohibition on the appointment of administrators, which previously has given rise to the court having to consider the point in a </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">couple of reported cases.  We agree with this proposal on the basis that it should avoid further applications to the court.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Paragraph 6 –We welcome the suggested amendments to paragraph 26 of Schedule B1 which has been the subject of numerous cases relating to the validity of appointment for out of court administrators.

The Secretary of State has the ability to seek information from "any person" at present pursuant to CPR 31.17(3) and we cannot see how a wider power as envisaged in the Bill can be justified. We note that there is a discussion paper "</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Transparency &amp; Trust: Enhancing the transparency of UK company ownership and increasing trust in UK business</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';
