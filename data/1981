Our members are people working in the public services, for private contractors providing public services and in the essential utilities. They include frontline staff and managers, working full or part time in local authorities, the NHS, the police service, colleges and schools, the electricity, gas and water industries, transport and the voluntary sector.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UNISON’s response is focused on a number of clauses that is of particular concern to the union and its members. These are Clause 1 ‘Health and Safety at work: general duty of self-employed persons’, Clause 2 ‘Removal of employment tribunals’ power to make wider recommendations’, and Clauses 58-61: ‘Exercise of regulatory functions: economic growth’. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Clause 1: Health and Safety at work </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UNISON shares the concern of the TUC that this proposal will leave workers at greater risk of injury, ill health and abuse at work. By restricting coverage of the Health and Safety at Work Act and taking those self-employed who pose no risk to others from its scope, it will increase the risk of fatality and injury, and the ill-health rate. It is also opposed by the health and safety professionals’ body, IOSH, who labelled it a ‘short sighted and misleading move’ and pointed out that it would not support business. It will simply cause unhelpful confusion and uncertainty. </span></p><ul type="square" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Wingdings; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.49pt; padding-left:7.51pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UNISON believes that the changes proposed are completely unnecessary as the only time the Health and Safety at work Act can be used is in circumstances whereby the person does put another person at risk. If they injure another person through their work, regardless of what they may have believed beforehand, the Act will apply.</span></li><li style="font-family:Wingdings; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.49pt; padding-left:7.51pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">At present, there is a straightforward obligation on all self-employed people to ensure that you protect others from harm resulting from your work activity. This gives everyone a necessary clarity about their legal duty, </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">that  ensures</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> no-one can take risks with others’ safety or health. </span></li></ul><ul type="square" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Wingdings; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.49pt; padding-left:7.51pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UNISON also does not believe that there is any need to change the duty of a self-employed person not to injure </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">themselves</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">. No self-employed person has ever been prosecuted or threatened with prosecution for only risking their own health, however the Health and Safety at Work Act means that the HSE has been able to give them guidance on how to protect their own safety. </span></li><li style="font-family:Wingdings; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.49pt; padding-left:7.51pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Despite the provisions of this Draft Bill, every self-employed person is still going to have to do a risk assessment to see if their work poses a risk to others, just as they do now. However, self-employed people might become unsure if they are covered, or presume that they are not, especially if they are not on the proscribed list of occupations or sectors. Given that some of the most dangerous industries, such as </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">agriculture and construction, all contain a high proportion of self-employed people, the implications of this is alarming. </span></li><li style="font-family:Wingdings; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.49pt; padding-left:7.51pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UNISON is also concerned that people who control the workplace where self-employed people work (often bogus-self-employed) will wrongly think that they do not have any duty of care to them. Self-employed people who employ others may interpret it as meaning that they are exempt from the law. </span></li><li style="font-family:Wingdings; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.49pt; padding-left:7.51pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">While the Bill claims that the proposals are being done ‘for the reduction of burdens resulting from legislation for businesses or other organisations or for individuals”, it will not change the existing situation for those who genuinely do not pose a risk to others but will  in reality create complete confusion for other self-employed people. </span></li></ul><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Clause 2: Tribunals’ powers to make wider recommendations</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UNISON strongly opposes Clause 2 of the draft Bill which would remove the power of Employment Tribunals to issue wider recommendations to employers found to have unlawfully discriminated. This power provides a key additional remedy to unlawful discrimination cases, meaning that where the victim had left the workplace (as they do in 72% of cases), the Tribunal would be able to address the problem of discrimination more generally or prevent it from recurring. If a key objective of anti-discrimination legislation is to eliminate it from workplaces, then UNISON considers this power to be vital. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The Government claims that it is addressing “employer fears about inappropriate or excessive recommendations” but has not produced any credible evidence to support this. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">In 2012, there were 19 cases where Tribunals issued wider recommendations. In 15 of those cases they recommended training on equality and diversity. In seven cases, respondents were asked to address equality issues generally or to review policies. Consideration of these cases reveals them to be proportionate and reasonable suggestions to address serious cases of discrimination. For example:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="square" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Wingdings; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.49pt; padding-left:7.51pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Stone v Ramsay Health Care: </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">the Tribunal found that there was a ‘thorough and abject failure by the [employer] to have protected the claimant from pregnancy and maternity discrimination’ and were reportedly shocked that the employer asked an employee to work two days after she had given birth. It recommended training for senior managers and HR on maternity and pregnancy rights and to redraft their equal opportunity policies. In making these recommendations, the Tribunal stated that it “was of concern to us given the considerable resource of this respondent and the likelihood that it employs considerable numbers of women.”</span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="square" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Wingdings; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.49pt; padding-left:7.51pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Crisp v Iceland foods: </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The Tribunal recommended that those with HR responsibilities and area level managers be trained on disability discrimination, having noted that the employer did not take her disability seriously, she was both harassed and directly discriminated because of her disability and the employer failed to make reasonable adjustments.</span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="square" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Wingdings; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.49pt; padding-left:7.51pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Austin v Samuel Grant (North East) ltd</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: the Tribunal recommended that the employer update its policies on discrimination and that the directors and managers receive diversity training, having noted that the managing director had a long history of sending racist and sexist emails and the HR manager had failed to properly deal with the issue. </span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="square" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Wingdings; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.49pt; padding-left:7.51pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">None of these recommendations are ‘excessive’ and are widely regarded and promoted as good practice by business, Government and a range of other organisations. A publication by BIS &amp; the GEO ‘</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">The Business Case for Equality and Diversity’ </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">concluded that securing such benefits requires “appropriate policies and practices, including appropriate training for those with lead teams.” According to the GEO, the net total benefits of repealing the provisions for private and voluntary sector employers are estimated to be between £0 and £10,000. </span></li><li style="font-family:Wingdings; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.49pt; padding-left:7.51pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UNISON believes these Tribunal powers have an important role to play in addressing the causes of discrimination. The Government has cited research that shows that 54% of employers who are the subject of a discrimination claim “make at least one change” to their practice following the case. However, UNISON is deeply concerned about the significant 46% of employers who do nothing despite having a claim made against them. As the cases cited above show, employers who have been subject to a Tribunal recommendation had engaged in such poor practices that they were likely to continue breaching the Equality Act unless steps were taken. </span></li><li style="font-family:Wingdings; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.49pt; padding-left:7.51pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The Government has also claimed that ‘because the recommendations are non-binding, we feel that these provisions are not having a significant impact on employer behaviour’. But it cannot credibly claim that this power is simultaneously both irrelevant and excessive. If the Government wished to make the recommendations more effective, it could make them binding on employers. </span></li></ul><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UNISON also shares the TUC’s concerns about the Government’s Impact Assessment of August 2012:</span></p><ul type="square" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Wingdings; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.49pt; padding-left:7.51pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The Impact Assessment did not capture the full benefits of employers implementing recommendation. It assumed that the only monetary benefit was a slight reduction in Tribunal claims. However, there are broader benefits to the workplace and employment practices as the Impact Assessment acknowledges but does not quantify. </span></li><li style="font-family:Wingdings; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.49pt; padding-left:7.51pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The Government has failed to adequately consider the equality impact of the repeal. It claims that the repeal would have ‘no </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">significant  impact</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> on any of the protected characteristics’, largely because employers already ‘make changes following a finding of discrimination against them.’ However, this only happens in 54% of cases and even then, it is not clear whether the changes employers make would be as effective or as appropriate as the ones recommended by Tribunals. </span></li><li style="font-family:Wingdings; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.49pt; padding-left:7.51pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The Impact assessment is also now badly out of date. It was conducted when Tribunals had only issued wider recommendations in four cases, leading to a conclusion that there ‘was very little empirical evidence of the power’s usage and the positive impact that it may have’. According to the EOR, there are now at least 28 cases. These should be examined as part of any credible and improved impact assessment. </span></li></ul><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Clauses 58-61: Exercise of regulatory functions – economic duty</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">These clauses impose a new duty on some bodies that exercise certain regulatory functions, to the desirability of promoting economic growth. UNISON believes that these clauses are not only unnecessary but also potentially damaging and in some cases likely to compromise the independence of some regulatory bodies such as the HSE or the EHRC, both of which are required under EU legislation to operate at arm’s length from the Government in the exercise of their statutory functions. </span></p><ul type="square" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Wingdings; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.49pt; padding-left:7.51pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UNISON shares the TUC’s concern about the wording of the clauses, which are opaque. Clause 60 permits a Minister of the Crown to issue guidance as to the meaning of economic growth, but there is no detail on the face of the Bill as to what this phrase will mean in practise. </span></li><li style="font-family:Wingdings; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.49pt; padding-left:7.51pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">While UNISON believes that it is important that regulators do not set out to impede economic growth, placing a statutory duty obliging them to have regard to it in the exercise of their functions, with no clarity as to where and how this might operate, will interfere with their ability to perform their other duties. </span></li><li style="font-family:Wingdings; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.49pt; padding-left:7.51pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">There is also no indication as to how this duty would be enforced and who would judge whether or not fulfilling the new duty would conflict with an existing duty to perform a particular function. There is a danger that those who are being regulated will attempt to use this new duty to override the actions of the regulator. A business, for example could argue that requiring a particular process to be undertaken before conducting a particular activity would prevent them from making a profit and thus reduce their ability to grow. On the other hand, not conducting the process could lead to an accident or illness of an employee. Which of these competing duties would prevail and who would decide? </span></li><li style="font-family:Wingdings; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.49pt; padding-left:7.51pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The Government has already introduced a similar measure for the Pensions Regulator. The Pensions Bill establishes a new objective for the Regulator to ‘minimise any adverse impact on the sustainable growth of an employer of its defined benefit regulatory regime’. This is hugely controversial because it seems likely that employers will be able to point to this law as a reason to reduce, for instance, deficit recovery contributions – which means defined benefit pension </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">schemes</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> are more likely to close. A growth objective may impede the Regulator’s primary function of protecting pension scheme member benefits. </span></li><li style="font-family:Wingdings; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.49pt; padding-left:7.51pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The Government should provide evidence that either that the Hampton Principles are not being applied or that they do not work. We have not seen any evidence to this end produced by the Government in support of this proposal. </span></li><li style="font-family:Wingdings; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 28.49pt; padding-left:7.51pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UNISON joins with the TUC in urging the Government to drop these clauses and consider other non-legislative ways of encouraging regulators to adopt a balanced approach to their statutory functions. </span></li></ul><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">September 2013</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
