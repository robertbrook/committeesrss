There is also a research programme being carried out in the UK at Oxford University. However, thus far this work is limited to a relatively small number of vehicles into which is fitted a substantial computer system including a variety of sensors. The infrastructure is currently very immature in relation to car to car and car to infrastructure communication. That said, some States in the USA have licensed the use of autonomous vehicles within that state alone for example Nevada, where the only stipulation is that the vehicle bears a red licence plate to identify it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-variant:small-caps">Future Issues for the Police Service</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Road Safety</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">From an engineering perspective, designers see autonomous vehicles as the way in which “Vision Zero”- no collisions could be achieved, with the human error element, via the driver being removed.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Technical </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">One of the issues discussed within the ITS workforce is around what comes first, the vehicles or the infrastructure?
