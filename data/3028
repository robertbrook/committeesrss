From a Greater Manchester perspective, the managed motorway schemes, both those programmed</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:13pt"> for delivery and those in the pipeline will help to alleviate existing congestion on key parts of the motorway network. This will improve journey time reliability for both commuters and businesses. The commitment to a new feasibility study looking at tran</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:13pt">s-Pennine links between Manchester and Sheffield is also welcome, particularly as it will take a multi-modal approach.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:13pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:13pt">Looking to the future, Greater Manchester has the potential to deliver significant economic growth in the future, with 50,000 additional</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:13pt"> jobs forecast in the city centre alone. There are significant growth locations very close to the motorway network, particularly the Airport City Enterprise Zone (7,000 jobs in the initial phases, potentially rising to 11,500) and the Port Salford tri-moda</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:13pt">l freight interchange (3,800 jobs), and their success will depend on connectivity being maintained. The production of Route-based Strategies is therefore welcome, because this will allow these local growth considerations to be fed into the planning process</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:13pt"> for the network. The process will provide greater long-term funding certainty for major road schemes which can then inform complementary local transport investment.

The performance of SRN junctions is a key consideration in th</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:13pt">e management of the local road network, as the impact of congestion at these junctions can be widespread. In major urban areas there is therefore a need for a ‘total network’ approach to managing and investing in the road network as a whole, for example ma</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:13pt">naging and addressing pinch points in partnership.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:13pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:13pt">Additional investment in roads will often provide additional capacity and the additional traffic will result in environmental impacts in terms of air quality, carbon emissions, noise and biodiversity.
