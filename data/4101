A small claim took 2 years and the courts malice led to an unfounded award of £3k and bankruptcy proceedings. I am in the 1% to have my case fully investigated and upheld (partially). The investigation serves to protect the interests of the public body. Double standards for evidence and shifting goal posts are hallmarks of the investigation. The PHSO exists to perpetuate itself. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Original Case</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">I was subject to a campaign of harassment by admin staff at Barnet County Court. On complaining the harassment escalated.  A memo was written to the Judge saying ‘teach her a lesson’. Another memo was equally inflammatory both were </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">heeded</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> by the Judges. One awarded costs of £3k in a case worth £1k. This was a small claim I was un-represented whilst the defendant had a large legal team. District Judge Marin did not explain what unreasonable behaviour merited this outrageous award because he knew there was no basis for it. Litigants in Person are stereotyped and deemed acceptable punch bags by courts around London. There is significant abuse of power. Upon complaining I got no reply and so went via my MP to the PHSO.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">PHS</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">STAGE ONE</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">They refused to look at my complaint because I’d not had a final response.

The PHSO’s idea of an investigation involves the placement of a certain template onto a case. One’s case is made to fit that template and inconvenient bits are dropped or otherwise explained away. Double standards for evidence are employed and goals change all the time. There is bias towards protecting the public body. I needed information to launch a higher court appeal however the PHSO and Ministry of Justice colluded in preventing this happening. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Serious and illegal mal administration is ignored whilst trivial matters are upheld. The investigators conduct was poor she misrepresented conversations we had and failed to award costs I’d incurred despite saying she would. I was cheated again.

The PHSO disregarded my legitimate and properly expressed needs for more time. I felt disrespected by their double standards. From their files I learned the investigator delayed the investigation three times amounting to a 6 month delay.

By protecting the poor behaviour of public bodies the PHSO has created systemic indifference to complaints. Malignant cultures thrive where no punishment is ever delivered and often only encouraged. The last place such menace should be found is in the Justice system but it is rampant here. Being in the 1% cost me time, effort, uncertainty and loss of opportunity to lodge an appeal. I felt insulted and disrespected in my interactions with the investigator. I hope the 99% may take some solace in that they were saved the additional layers of grief the PHSO inflicted on me. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">December 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
