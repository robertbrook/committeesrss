font-size:12.5pt; font-weight:bold">National Federation of Roofing Contractors (NFRC)</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12.5pt"> is the leading roofing trade association in the United Kingdom.  Encompassing more than 1000 trade contractors and 165 Associate Members (including manufacturers, suppliers and service providers), the NFRC represents over 70% of the UK’s roofing industry by value. </span></li><li style="font-family:Calibri;

font-size:12.5pt; font-weight:bold">single set of regulations</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12.5pt">.  Too many guidelines and specifications exist at present; industry must contend not only with the standards covered by the Code for Sustainable Homes and the Housing Standards Review, but also the NHBC, </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12.5pt">BSi</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12.5pt">, the National Building Specification, manufacturers' information, local area housing standards, and others.  This unnecessary quantity of requirements has resulted in duplicated specifications, inefficiency, industry confusion and difficulty for contractors in understanding everything required.  This compilation of industry regulations must be carried out as a </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12.5pt; font-weight:bold">matter of urgency</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12.5pt">.</span></li><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12.5pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 14.49pt; padding-left:13.86pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12.5pt">The current range of standards that exist in the UK are costing the industry many millions, not only through inefficiency losses and lost time, but also through misunderstandings and confusion which can lead to penalty clauses, defects and law suits.  Construction businesses often have to wade through and compare Building Regulations and other specifications to see how they relate to each other, which ones carry the most weight, and how they should be followed best, before any work can be carried out.  This is an unnecessary level of bureaucracy, and could easily be avoided through the creation of a single set of standards. </span></li><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12.5pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 14.49pt; padding-left:13.86pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12.5pt">Standards have also been subjected to a varying range of reviews, which raises questions about the necessity and quality of many of the guidelines industry is subject to.  For instance, in general, only the UK Building Regulations have so far </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12.5pt">been subject to formal, robust impact assessments, while many others mentioned above have not.  Local authority planning guidance and standards can vary wildly across the country.  Compiling all existing standards into one single code would therefore help to ensure that all are appropriate to the construction sector.  Likewise, local planning policy should be based on one that of one lead local authority, which can then form a single standard for all other authorities.  It is vital that Government understands the difficulty that having multiple, unlinked specifications presents to the industry, which could operate far better without the burden of excessive red tape and confusion.</span></li><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12.5pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 14.49pt; padding-left:13.86pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12.5pt">It is also important to note that these standards need to be brought together, but </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12.5pt; font-weight:bold">without watering down their content </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12.5pt">or guidance.  This will ensure that they remain fit for purpose, but will cut down on duplication and make it much easier for businesses to understand and follow them.  The NFRC believes that the industry needs to have a major input into the melding of these standards, through trade bodies and umbrella associations, as they are best placed to understand, advise on and explain industry requirements.  Government should look to these organisations to lead on the relevant sets of standards for their sector, to ensure that the clearest and most appropriate standards emerge from a collation of all existing guidelines.</span></li><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12.5pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 14.49pt; padding-left:13.86pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12.5pt">The NFRC therefore urges the Environmental Audit Committee to consider exploring the option of combining all existing building regulations into one single code, which must be effective, fit for purpose and maintain standards of a certain quality, ensuring that existing standards are not watered down.  Government should closely engage with industry representative bodies to ensure that a new, single set of standards are fit for purpose, efficient, and will best support the construction industry.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:12.5pt;
