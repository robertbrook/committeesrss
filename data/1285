font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">While a thriving place to live, in the last census the inhabitants numbered four thousand plus and the figures showed that the local population was slanted </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">towards an older demographic, though this group in no way reflects the total population of the town.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The town grew from a series of very small settlements as the railway brought tourists and those seeking a clean, healthy place to reside. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Grange over San</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">ds still boasts a gentle climate, amazing local shops and a slower pace of life and this continues to encourage both tourists and retirees to the town. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">These two groups mean that Grange over Sands has a particular need for reliable, regular and accessible</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> local public transport on a year round basis.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Grange over Sands, while not isolated, is surrounded by small villages which very much rely on the limited amount of public transport available. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">At present</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> the town is quite well served by both rail and bus</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> services during the week and on Saturdays, though a wider range of destinations might be desirable. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">There is an (approximate) hourly service on both bus and rail services during the day, but a less frequent service in the evening. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">On Sundays the service</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> for both bus and rail travel is very limited, making it impossible, for example,</span><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> to travel to and from entertainment in Kendal, Barrow or Lancaster, or indeed for any other purpose. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Despite some shortcomings, the X6 bus service (from Barrow to Kendal vi</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">a Grange over Sands and Ulverston) could be described as a well-used lifeline for the people of the Furness peninsula. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">This service however, would never have happened without quite considerable investment from Cumbria County Council to get the route up an</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">d running and at the point it is today, where it is popular enough to continue without a subsidy. This really shows what both farsightedness and long term investment can achieve. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">At present there is also a local ‘circular’ bus service on weekdays and Sat</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">urdays which services the local villages and outlying settlements. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">There is no evening service on this route and no Sunday or Bank Holiday service, despite this being a busy tourist destination. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">There is also a very well-used, but intermittent, weekday s</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">ervice from Cartmel via some of the villages to Grange and ultimately to Kendal. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">This bus links in with school services and also serves the village of Levens, between Grange over Sands and Kendal.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> It would be very vulnerable to loss should the schools fr</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">anchise change. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The bus</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> is often very full and frequently is standing only when it reaches the village of Levens, not ideal when many of the users are older people.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial;

font-size:11pt">A series of passenger number and destination surveys have been, and are being, carried out by FLAG (Furness Line Act</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">ion Group) and FLCRP (Furness Line Community Rail Partnership) to ascertain current figures for through journeys beginning before or ending beyond Lancaster. </span><span style="font-family:Arial;

font-size:11pt">nificant detrimental effect upon the financial wellbeing of many communities in the area as well as making the whole peninsula less attractive to inward investment. </span><span style="font-family:Arial;

font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">It is sometimes the case that cyclists arriving at local stations find insufficient space for bicycles on the trains and due to the current lack of extra rolling stock</span><span style="font-family:Arial;

font-size:11pt"> Travelling by bus is not much easier, although the Grange Circular (service 532) which services areas of Grange over Sands and outlying villages is a low</span><span style="font-family:Arial;

font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">While there are a number of community transport schemes operating in Cumbria, should local public transport services deteriorate, these could be better developed locally and Grange over Sands should probably become a focus for such services in the Cartmel </span><span style="font-family:Arial;

font-size:11pt"> A worrying point in this issue is the fact that lack of local tran</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">sport services limits the social options of residents without personal transport.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> This can lead to isolation and depression, particularly in the elderly and or those living alone. </span><span style="font-family:Arial;
