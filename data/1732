This can range from contracted out social care services to bailiffs. Where a service has been provided on behalf of a local authority, whether provided direct by them or by a private provider through a contract, they fall under the jurisdiction of the LGO and the local authority is remains ultimately responsible for any maladministration or service failure.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="6" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.17pt; padding-left:3.83pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Our jurisdiction also extends to considering complaints about the procurement process, under powers granted to us in 2008. Our earliest published decision under these powers focussed upon failings in a local authority tendering process that exposed the Council to “significant risks”. The report highlighted the importance of properly trained and experienced staff along with robust evaluation and audit processes.

In particular, we highlighted the need for councils to ensure that bailiffs handle any complaints quickly and clearly, with the council taking final responsibility for its bailiff’s action. Our work in this area is being considered by government as they consider options for the regulation of bailiffs and we have met with the Ministry of Justice to ensure that our experience informs any developments.

An important aspect of that is for providers and local authorities to ensure that users are fully aware of their right to complain when things go wrong, including reference to the Ombudsman for complaints that remain unresolved.  The public must still be able to access a local authority’s complaints procedure even where a service is being delivered by a private contractor. The appropriate use of signposting mechanisms will be fundamental in ensuring that the public can seek an effective resolution of their complaints.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">This might include ensuring that the complaint process features in any contract between the local authority and a provider so that the public retains clear routes to redress and so that the public purse does not bear the financial costs of the failings of a commissioned or procured service. Councils must remember that they can outsource the service but cannot outsource the accountability.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="10" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">It is for this reason that we have offered to work with the Government’s Commissioning Academy to ensure that the commissioning process takes account of the importance of providing the public with clear routes to redress when commissioned services let them down. We look forward to working with the Academy as they seek to support the effective commissioning of public services.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">September 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
