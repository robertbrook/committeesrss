Unfortunately for </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Syria</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and the Syrian people, it has become more of a banker, providing resources and arms supplies to the various factions, but it is no longer a major fighting force inside </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Syria</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q2 Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> There is a proliferation of opposition groups at the moment, some armed and some unarmed.

The conflict has mutated—in fact, what we are witnessing in Syria is a fierce geo-strategic struggle between, on the one hand Saudi Arabia and its allies, and on the other hand Iran. This fierce geo-strategic struggle has major sectarian connotations. So, unfortunately for the Syrian people, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Syria</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in many ways has become more of a battlefield for regional powers.

What is really most surprising about the Syrian Army is that it has not only remained an intact fighting force in the last two or three years, but it has become a deadlier fighting force in the last two and a half years. The question is why the Syrian Army has survived as long as it </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">has and why it has adjusted and adapted to urban warfare. It is because of the retraining and restructuring that the Syrian Army has undergone by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. Based on everything that we know, there has been a restructuring of the Syrian Army. If you look at the last three years or so, the army now has more capacity to go on the offensive; its fighting capabilities have increased a great deal and improved a great deal.

It would not have been the same, I agree with you. There are two questions I want to address, although I know our time is limited. First, there was a major strategic blunder on the part of the western powers, particularly when the American President said that Assad must go; Assad’s days were numbered and he must go. Yet that particular strategic statement was not backed by any kind.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Of course, the British followed by repeating the same; and the French and what have you. I do not think that President Barack Obama had given any strategic or major calculation. In fact, we know now that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> intelligence services had a different assessment of Assad’s days; that his ship was not sinking, contrary to what the American President said. In that particular sense, there was a calculation; a combination of economic warfare, psychological warfare, regional pressure with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Turkey</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Qatar</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Saudi Arabia</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> supporting the opposition.

There are a variety of reasons. First, we underestimated Assad’s ability to fight to the bitter end. We underestimated the social base of support that Assad had—whether it is 30%. In particular, we underestimated the capacity of the Syrian Army to fight and remain an intact force. We underestimated the capacity of regional allies to support Assad. The most important thing we underestimated was the pivotal support that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Russia</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> provided, too.

There are 75,000 Syrian Kurd refugees in the camp, and there are, I am told, a total of some 200,000 or 250,000 Kurdish refugees in the Iraqi Kurdistan region. My instinct is that those people will not be going back for a considerable time, because they are well looked after and many of the men are able to work and are supported by the Kurdish regional Government. It is clear from the conversations I had there that many of the Kurds in Iraq are anti-Assad, yet the main fighting group among the Kurdish-Syrian population, the PYD, seem now to be working in league with Assad against some of the al-Qaeda-linked elements. What are the long-term implications of that and the fact that the Kurdish region of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Syria</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> now seems effectively to be under the control of the PYD?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Professor </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Gerges</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes, as you said, there are major divisions among the Syrian Kurds. The PYD does not speak for all the Kurdish political elements. Yes, the PYD is implicitly working indirectly with the Assad regime and is seizing the opportunity because it realises that this is a historic moment to have autonomy, as opposed to a state within a state. The PYD has been successful in clearing most of the Kurdish areas of the al-Qaeda and al-</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Nusra</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">f</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">ront</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">s.

You have Arabs and Christians, which tells you that, ultimately, there will be ethnic cleansing, particularly if the PYD decides to pursue the strategy of having an autonomous Kurdish area. I do not think the Syrian opposition, whether you are talking about the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Salafi</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> elements or the Free Syrian Army, would allow the Kurdish areas to establish an autonomous zone within </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Syria</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> itself.

It is a recent development. I think that we miss the big picture by saying that it is a sectarian divide.

You have sectarian mobilisation. You have major material and ideological resources invested in trying to mobilise both camps. The reality is that the sectarian divide masks geostrategic interests. The geostrategic struggle is what matters—that is the independent variable. The sectarian divide is basically used as an asset by the geostrategic powers in order to mobilise their own communities.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">So what does Hezbollah say? “We intervened not only to save the Assad regime, but to save the shrine of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Zainab</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, one of the most sacred </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Shi’a</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> shrines in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Syria</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.” Many </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Shi’a</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Iraqis are coming to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Syria</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and mobilising on the fact that the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Shi’a</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> community and shrines are being threatened.

It seems to be fragmented. What is your assessment of this?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Shashank Joshi:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I do not see why its natural tendency should be to coalesce in the first place. First, there are ideological differences involved. You have the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">jihadis</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> at one end of the spectrum; you have what Professor </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Gerges</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> called moderate </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Salafis</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, although some may disagree that they are moderate, groups that have coalesced into the Islamic Front, which is itself a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">coalition of three previous umbrella groups plus others; and then you have the FSA with its Supreme Military Council, which itself has some brigades and battalions that have overlapping membership with the Islamic Front. There is no natural reason why these ideologically differently inclined groups should coalesce in the first place.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">On top of that, you have geographic differences—these groups are active in different places. So even within the Islamic Front, some of these groups have turf to defend; they can extract rent and they can smuggle in particular areas. And you have external sources of support. You have Saudi Arabia supporting not only the Islamic Front, as Professor </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Gerges</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> rightly identified, but specific groups within that, so they have an incentive to maintain that support and avoid sharing the spoils of those outside resources with others.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In a way, I am not sure why they should coalesce. Their objectives are different. Their threshold for what constitutes victory is different. We have already seen six out of seven groups in this Islamic Front, which is one of the most significant bodies in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Syria</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> now, say that any attendance at the Geneva II talks by the moderate opposition would be considered completely unacceptable and would invite retaliation, so they have different objectives as well.

Those who were supporting the Islamic Front say. “This is our only hope for pulling fighters away from the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham.” Some have said that they can work tactically with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Jabhat</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> al-</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Nusra</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and pull it away from </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">ISIS</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, because those two al-Qaeda groups themselves have their own differences. I think the Free Syrian Army’s calculation was that if they were fated to have this front and lose members to it, at least it would weaken the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">jihadis</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> themselves.

It was not easy to access what was going on.

It wasn’t just to do with social support. There were plenty of people saying, “Assad has the support of his people,” and in many cases saying so on fairly spurious grounds. People were saying that 50% of the population supported Assad. Part of the issue was that we just got the military analysis wrong and that was pure lack of information.

It was not going to be a regime-threatening strike. It would have targeted some elite military units and would have had a concrete impact on Assad’s effectiveness, but after that point, now that the disarmament effort is under way, I do not see why it would particularly strengthen Assad. Once the process continues, there will be less and less need for co-operation with the Assad regime anyway and he will be almost back to where he started.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q43 Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The whole chemical weapons situation, in effect, led to the announcement that Geneva II would take place on 22 January.

How do we get round that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Turkmani</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think this applies not only to the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">jihadis</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> who are fighting the regime, but to the extremists who are fighting on the side of the regime, such as people from </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Hezbollah</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> or </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iraq</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. The issue here is that, yes, the new authority may be obliged to fight in other ways those who refuse to join any peaceful solution, but the peaceful solution has to be offered first, and it has never been an option. On the contrary, the option of escalating the violence created the ground that gave rise to all the jihadists. There was no jihadist group in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Syria</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> that began straight away in an area of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Syria</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> where there was no fighting. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Jihadism</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> does not arise from a safe area. First violence spreads into the area, with the regime attacking the people and people responding. Then it gets far more complex, and becomes a pointless conflict with support from outside for both sides. That creates a perfect environment for </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">jihadism</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. You have a failed state, you have violence and you have people who are desperate.

I want to emphasise that the people who make up the body of these groups are not as you describe. They are merely Syrians who found no other options and no other way to go. They were very desperate. Yes, the leadership of the jihadist groups is extreme and will continue to fight any coming authority, regardless of who wins this conflict, but we have a chance of taking these human resources from them if we offer peace. If we look at young Syrians who are joining the jihadists because there is no other way, I think we have a huge opportunity to weaken this extreme mentality.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Shiraz Maher:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You mentioned the sectarian element and disregard for the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Shi’a</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> community.

They are not fighting 24 hours a day. They might spend two days of the week fighting, and they spend the rest of their time in religious indoctrination classes. A large part of the classes involves really absorbing and imbibing the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">al-Qaeda</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> narrative and its world view.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Our centre has been in touch with a number of Britons who are in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Syria</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> right now, fighting with jihadist organisations. It is quite telling: we can see from our interactions with them that they have adopted wholesale that ideology and that world view. They must have been radicalised to an extent before leaving the West, because that would have motivated their departure. However, if they were not already highly radicalised before they left the West, we can say with a degree of confidence that even those who do return to the West will bring with them the very devastating world view that we have seen proliferate over the last decade or so.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q65 Mike Gapes:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> May I put to you a scenario that you might say is fanciful?

It was the regime that was the strongest party; it was the regime that was killing, right? So when this regime was confronted with any level of violence, even just one bullet, it would respond 100 times more violently. So surely by confronting it with violence, we were just calling for more and more violence from the regime.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There are so many examples.

It was safe; it was highly populated. The regime did not interfere with this area—not because of its good will, but, for whatever reason, it did not interfere with it. Once fighting groups took a decision to enter this area—and there was a firm decision; it was not self-defence—the regime decided to send missiles and to apply a blockade. Somebody died in the cold weather in that rich area. So, yes, violence got the worst out of the regime. We knew that it is in control of the country, and this is how it is going to respond, and kill its own people.

The only safe exit now is through the only channel open to the regime: to share power in the Government of Syria. I am not saying that it will accept that necessarily. There does not seem to be enough international will for that to happen. The regime is now behaving as a Russian agent, not as a regime for its own people.

It is in their best interest for the killing to stop, to have a ceasefire and for the crisis to be over, whereas it is not necessarily in the best interest of warlords to end the crisis. If there are to be peace talks, I would rather have at the table those who have an interest in ending the crisis, not just parties that are gaining from the continuation of the conflict.

There are still so many Syrians inside the country, and we have to ask: who is running the society? Is it the political groups? No. Is it the military groups? No. It is the silent player in the background: the newly emerging civil society. It is delivering services, offering protection, delivering food, assisting the wounded and doing media work.

It is a public movement, and public movements take time to develop leadership. When the UK decided to recognise the opposition in exile as the sole legitimate representative of the Syrian people, it actually removed the opportunity for the real leadership—the grass roots leadership—to emerge from within civil society circles to lead the movement and become its real voice, expressing the real needs of Syrian society and calling for a solution. Instead, the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> recognised people who live most of the time in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">France</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> or in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. The people inside </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Syria</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> were saying, “Those people do not represent us.”</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I would say that the leadership model was applied was wrong. The leadership should have come from the bottom up, not from the top down. I think there was interference with the Syrian public movement to impose a particular leadership on them and to recognise a particular player as the sole legitimate representative. Who is any non-Syrian party to decide who is the legitimate representative? The Syrian regime is not legitimate; how can anyone else decide who the legitimate party is?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q75 Sandra Osborne:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you agree with the previous witness that there is potential for radicalisation among refugees both within </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Syria</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and in other countries, such as </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Lebanon</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">?

We are seeing younger people than before being radicalised—the example of the Palestinian connection is a good one. Certainly, again, with a lot of the jihadists we interact with and talk to and whose media output we monitor, you are seeing individuals as young as 13 and 14 serving within their ranks—not to a significant extent but it is happening. Again, if this conflict is protracted and continues over many years you would expect to see those numbers grow over time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I want to come back to one of the points about the civil society. It is difficult to see quite what shape and manner this civil society movement we are hearing about is taking. Ultimately, if they are the ones delivering the infrastructure now away from the state—delivering food into certain areas and so on—you have to ask who is opening up the supply lines to ensure those food supplies can get in. You are seeing a starvation campaign take place right now on the outskirts of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Damascus</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. Who was it who went down to those parts to try to reopen supply routes in? It was the jihadist fighters, unfortunately.
