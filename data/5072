Moreover, practical experience in combating INNS issues around the world has developed significantly, with an </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">array of successful prevention, rapid response, major eradication and long term control initiatives.  The UK has a number of active research groups but is not at present one of the world’s principal centres of expertise in academic invasion science. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Some general patterns of invasion are well understood and should be clear targets for action: for example, introducing non-native vertebrates to islands, or freshwater fish and crayfish to aquatic systems, will nearly always prove damaging and must be prevented or subject to rapid response action as a matter of high priority. Predicting invasions can sometimes be challenging, however, as there is a degree of intrinsic uncertainty: predicting which species will become invasive, and what effect they will have on ecosystems is often less than 100% precise. Risk Assessment should be conducted and interpreted in that context, and should be a dynamic exercise that builds on new understanding and experience. Specific uncertainties must not, however, hinder the establishment of general prevention and rapid response capacities, as these will be fundamental to constructing an adequate future response to INNS.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Public understanding of INNS issues is often limited. This can generate difficulties when communicating and reporting on INNS issues, and when seeking public engagement – which will often be critical with respect to preventing introductions – and in promoting vigilance and early warning capacity. Public communications and awareness campaigns on INNS – key elements of an effective response - should focus on the idea that careless species movements cause problems, and that we must all remain vigilant. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Most importantly, government and agencies must ensure that surveillance mechanisms are adequate to inform effective rapid response capacity, particularly for areas of high vulnerability (islands, freshwater bodies, river catchments) and high biodiversity value (protected areas).

In a trading block such as the EU, if one Member State fails to implement adequate measures to prevent and combat INNS, the whole Union is put at risk. The growing number of biological invasions hitting EU countries, the risk of rapid spread and the wide spectrum of species and impacts requires a legal framework for coordinated action, for the benefit of all.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Domestic arrangements with respect to INNS across EU member states are currently inadequate, with the result that national Governments are having to spend significant amounts of money to tackle the problems on their own. Worryingly, there are no means to ensure that neighbouring countries take parallel measures in order to prevent new invasions of the same or similar species. This is true even for island states such as the UK, where the number of INNS present, relative to area and human population, does not differ significantly from continental states in Europe.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The European Commission’s draft Regulation on invasive alien species, published in September 2013, is therefore a significant positive step.
