In deciding how to proceed, we have been guided by three principles. First, that we should implement the Hirst judgment in a way that meets our legal obligations, but does not go further than that. Secondly, that the most serious offenders will not be given the right to vote. Thirdly, that we should seek to prevent the taxpayer having to face future claims for compensation.   The Government will therefore bring forward legislation providing that the blanket ban in the existing law will be replaced. Offenders sentenced to a custodial sentence of four years or more will lose the right to vote in all circumstances, which reflects the Government's clear view that more serious offenders should not retain the right to vote.” </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">In the Committee’s view, the proposed 6 month rule would not satisfy the Court and is not objectively justifiable and accordingly Option 2 should not be followed.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">In terms of the distinction between short and long term prisoners, based upon whether a prisoner has been sentenced to more or less than 4 years, sentencing generally has some relevance to the severity of the offence and the individual circumstances of the case and is therefore one of the criteria mentioned by the European Court of Human Rights which may allow disenfranchisement to be imposed.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Although there may be concern about whether Option 1 (4 year rule) would satisfy the court and that it may be vulnerable to challenge in future, nevertheless, it seems an appropriate mid-point.   There are currently 2,400 prisoner vote cases pending at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.   This may give the Committee some assistance when considering the potential impact of a failure to legislate properly on this topic.   As Lord Mackay stated in the Committee’s 5th Report (February 2011) Paragraph 13, persistence in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">ignoring the court’s judgement creates a situation where “the right to damages becomes a realistic expectation”.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">I hope that these comments are helpful.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">June 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
