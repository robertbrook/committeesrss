EU legislation does not generally apply to the self-employed, and the approach by other member states varies, with some countries choosing not to apply health and safety law to the self-employed, whilst several apply the law to the self-employed only where activities are considered particularly hazardous or if they present risks to others.

A 2003 evaluation of the HSAs found that only 30% of schools thought they had a positive impact on parents and teachers working together. The research also suggested that parents can find HSAs patronising and, because they are not legally enforceable, of limited value.

The growth duty will stimulate the use of interventions to achieve compliance which may be more supportive of the growth of a business than traditional compliance and enforcement methods/sanctions.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Benefits to individual businesses and to wider business sectors will be achieved through improved advice and guidance and, where possible, more proactive support for growth through for example regulators’ recognising where good business management practices match with a good grip on risks and compliance issues at key points in a business lifecycle. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The impact of the growth duty will be seen in areas where regulators have an element of discretion as to how they carry out their activity.  For example:</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 10.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">For an individual business, the regulator can choose the advice it gives on how to comply, its enforcement policies and actions, the registration or licensing processes it puts in place, the forms it requires and the fees it sets, within the bounds of the legal and policy framework it operates in. </span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 10.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">For the business community as a whole, the actions of a regulator can have wider economic impacts. For example, taking enforcement action can send a signal to the wider business community regarding ‘level playing fields’ and thus improve business confidence; while safety or consumer regulators can directly impact upon consumer confidence in certain sectors (such as civil nuclear or food safety). A regulator can also choose how and whether to engage with industry sectors on the guidance it produces. </span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The Government has taken care to frame the growth duty in a way which avoids negative unintended consequences - the growth duty will not prevent regulators from dealing with non-compliance using the full range of sanctions at their disposal nor have any impact on the importance of their current duties. We have worked closely with regulators and other Government departments and taken measures to mitigate risks where they have been identified. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The consultation process highlighted concerns among regulators that the duty could invite vexatious legal challenges intended to frustrate the regulatory system, consuming resources and undermining regulators’ ability to carry out their statutory functions. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Evidence from regulators however suggests that vexatious or unfounded claims made by businesses against regulators are rare as they are quickly thrown out by the courts and can also have a negative impact on businesses’ reputations. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">There are ways to minimise the legal risk of vexatious challenges, for example through guidance that articulates the sorts of measures regulators need to take to meet the growth duty in different regulatory fields, which will assist in defining expectations of the duty.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">How might the extent to which a regulator has fulfilled, or breached, the duty be ascertained? </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">At this stage the Government does not propose that the growth duty should impose additional reporting and monitoring requirements on regulators. These regulators are already be bound by obligations under the revised Regulators’ Code. However there will be a clear expectation that regulators will be transparent and make clear in public the steps they are taking to respond to the growth duty through existing mechanisms. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">If a regulated person has grounds for considering that a regulator has acted disproportionately, without having due regard for the impact its actions have had on growth, then the growth duty will provide a mechanism for regulated persons to hold regulators to account. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Where challenge mechanisms are already in place (e.g. appeals), the duty in primary legislation will provide a ground upon which businesses can challenge a decision taken by a regulator.  The risk of challenge will provide an important incentive for regulators to take the growth duty seriously and be transparent in how they respond to it. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">How can the likely financial and economic impact of the proposed duty be assessed? </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The Government has undertaken an initial impact assessment to identify the costs for regulators of implementing a growth duty and the benefits to society that the growth duty will deliver. Whilst costs and benefits are difficult to monetise, we will continue to build the evidence base and share this information with Parliament. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The current impact assessment found that a relatively modest saving to business of 0.3% of administrative costs would result in a positive net impact to society. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The growth duty is expected to generate significant benefits to businesses by:</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 10.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Contributing towards a reduction in unnecessary costs and burdens; </span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 10.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Allowing regulators to more confidently deliver compliance and support prosperity in partnership with business; </span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 10.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Helping businesses feel they are understood, trusted and empowered to be innovative in their business practices; </span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 10.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Improving the skills, knowledge and experience of the regulator and their interactions with business.</span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 99pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">So far, only a few regulators have felt able to provide details of anticipated costs of implementing the growth duty.  We will be working with regulators to develop guidance on how to respond to the growth duty. Regulators will be able to use this guidance to provide figures on the likely cost of implementing the growth duty and this additional information will be fed into the impact assessment as it is developed.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">A business survey has been commissioned to gather baseline data against which the impact of the growth duty will be measured.  The draft guidance currently in development may by extension also assist businesses in considering the likely benefits of a growth duty.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Consumers and individuals will benefit directly from growth. Moreover, the growth duty will encourage regulators to be more proportionate in their interactions with businesses that wish to comply.
