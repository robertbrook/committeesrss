Prospect is a trade union representing 120,000 professionals, managers and specialists across all sectors of the economy. We represent 50,000 professional scientists and engineers in the UK. These included more than 1,000 employed by the Forensic Science Service (FSS). At the time of the Select Committee’s initial inquiry we expressed considerable concerns about the merits of the decision to wind-down the FSS and the impact that it may have on the criminal justice system and forensic science in the UK. </span></p><p style="line-height:14pt; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="line-height:14pt; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">2. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Prospect therefore strongly welcomes the Select Committee’s decision to investigate the aftermath of the closure decision.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> To inform our submission we have consulted with our members who we</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">re made redundant from the FSS.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Their comments do not make for happy reading: In summary ‘We were world leaders in forensic science, something this country and our Prime </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">M</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">inister should have been proud of. Now we have a forensic archive that costs the taxpayer just as much to fund as having the FSS.

The majority have vast amounts of expertise which is simply lying dormant as they remain unemployed or have moved to other fields’. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">More than one member perceives that they have been ‘kicked out’ of their forensic science career only to ‘end up in an unskilled, low paid job with no prospects’. Some of those who have managed to stay in forensic science are paying a very high personal price to do so: ‘I am now travelling more than 120 miles a day … to a private forensic company’. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">O</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">thers </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">have </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">express</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">ed</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> concern</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> and frustration stemming from the</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> insecurity of employment in the private forensic sector, with a number facing redundancy for a second time. </span></p><p style="line-height:14pt; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="line-height:14pt; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">4.

For example there is now a European Standard Set for DNA profiling. The FSS was ready to use this system but it would have required a significant upgrade to the National DNA Database (NDNAD) software to allow profiles to be loaded. There is no sign of current FSPs moving to the ESS or of funding for the NDNAD to move forward to facilitate this. </span></p><p style="line-height:14pt; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="line-height:14pt; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">6.

Experiences of the transfer of work were particularly problematic in London. Overall four out of ten members consider that communications were poor, with some unfair treatment of staff.   </span></p><p style="line-height:14pt; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="line-height:14pt; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">10. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">There appears to have been prolonged uncertainty among staff about whether they would be transferred to another provider or made redundant. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">These concerns are explored in more detail in paragraphs </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">18 </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">to </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">20</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> below. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Even where staff were transferred, there are concerns that their full skills are not being utilised.

A year after transfer many of them are still not back to reporting cases or are doing so in a very limited capacity. Other homicide staff in the sexually motivate crimes unit were initially included in this transfer but this decision was reversed and they were subsequently made redundant.  </span></p><p style="line-height:14pt; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="line-height:14pt; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">11. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Feedback we have received from members indicates that </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">FSPs</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> were most interest in taking on FSS staff either with skills that are expensive to train or those that were recently qualified with little or no reporting experience. Conversely, there was little interest in recruiting the most experienced (and therefore higher paid) scientists. Consequently at least one generation of reporting scientists has been lost.

Much emphasis has been placed on the custody of the F</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">S</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">S archive, and rightly so, but this does not account for the many databases collected over the years, such as the 10,000 record Chorley analytical glass database, which have been lost to the forensic community. Neither does it account for the large scale loss of specialist equipment sold at auction, including the robotics platforms that had been in operation in London for barely one year. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">It is also worth noting that there was a wealth of intellectual property sold by the FSS – DNA Boost, Kwikmix (DNA mixture statistics software), DNA Insight.
