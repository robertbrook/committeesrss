We are here in November 2013 and clearly we have learnt something in the meantime. Looking back, I think the Stern Review was a bit optimistic about growth, particularly if we look at the science, which looks increasingly worrying in many ways. Emissions are on higher paths than we thought, some of the features are coming through more quickly than we thought, and some things left out of the science models, like the dangers of the thawing of the permafrost emitting methane, look more worrying than we thought. Looking back, I would have made the assumptions about growth and the implications for growth of a very hostile environment stronger, in the sense that I would have been more worried about future generations being possibly worse off and, in some areas, substantially worse off than the current one.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Of course, this was published in 2006, before the financial crisis, and we have had in many countries a period of interest rates on the floor and unemployed resources. That would have </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">been a good time to invest in the growth story of the future, which is a wave of technological change not exactly similar, but similar in many ways, to what we have seen a number of times in the past, from the mechanisation of textiles at the end of the 18th century through railways and steel and motor cars and so on. So the second thing I would emphasis is that we did not anticipate the recession then and this would have been a good time to have invested in the real growth opportunities. Those are the two things I would want to emphasise about the overall lessons we have learnt since then.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q2 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> How do you feel about Government policies and the strength of the signals they are sending to meet our climate change obligations?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Lord Stern</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I spoke in the Lords yesterday on the Teverson amendment. I broadly welcome the Energy Bill and the energy market reforms; I think they are on the right lines. My concern is Government-induced policy risk.

That undermines confidence. I have spent long periods as Chief Economist of the EbRD, which is largely an investment bank, Chief Economist of the World Bank, and head of the Government Economic Service here, so I have long experience discussing with investors round the world.

That is something I find worrying. We have deterred investment by vacillation over policy and an attempt to do something about it now, which I welcome, has itself been undermined.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q3 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> When you talk to investors they do raise the concerns of political risk, but there is also still a statement that in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> up until now, if there has been a mechanism, the Government has not reneged on it like </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Spain</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> did, where they changed the incentives retrospectively.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Lord Stern</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I would agree with that.

You are letting people have for free something that is deeply damaging. That is a market distortion, and I spent much of my professional career arguing the virtues of markets in allocating resources </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">and in discovery and so on. If you let people do damage for nothing, in whatever context it is in, you are essentially subsiding that activity.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In large measure I think that answers your question, but there is more to the answer than that. The answer to the question is that people should pay the cost of the resources they consume and the damage they do, just as when they buy a meal at a restaurant they pay for the rent at the restaurant, the time of the people who have cooked the food and served it to them and for the food itself. You expect to pay the costs and that is how markets work. The first part of the answer to the question is that people should pay the cost of the inputs and this is an input into the activity.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">On the other hand, of course, you want to protect the poorest in your communities, and that is a desire most Governments share. Clearly there are vigorous discussions about how best to do that, and there should be vigorous discussions how best to do that, but protecting the poorest in the community should come out of general taxation. By the way, if you did price carbon properly, you would have rather a lot of revenue in order to do just that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q5 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you see the new climate economy project bringing anything to the global understanding of climate change?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Lord Stern</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I hope so.

It is about the economics of the new climate economy. On the commission, we have a number of former finance ministers, presidents and prime ministers and half a dozen CEOs of the big firms in the world, so this is oriented to those who take economic decisions and those who invest in a serious way. I emphasise that because much of the international discussion of this issue is carried out by environment ministers. I bow to no one in my admiration of environment ministers, but generally they do not take the big economic decisions in society.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We wanted to look at this from a very direct, pragmatic, economics perspective and look at the policies, technologies and investments that are likely to be necessary to make this transition to a new carbon economy.

I am one of two vice-chairs of this commission and I also chair the economics advisory panel, a rather distinguished one: for example, it has on it Danny Kahneman of Princeton, who recently won the Nobel prize in economics, Phillippe Aghion of Harvard, arguable the leading growth theorist in the world, Dani Rodrik, another professor at Harvard, and Ottmar Edenhofer, who is the chair of working group III of the IPCC, which is looking at policy.

That is regressive, so if you apply the carbon tax they are going to have to pay more for that fuel. It is almost circular, is it not? You get yourself into a situation where you are taxing them and then giving them back the money. I wonder whether it would be better for us not to tax the fuel but, if Government is going to intervene, to make people more fuel-efficient. Is that not a more sensible approach, not least because it would be economically better if we use less energy for every 0.1% of growth we can secure? I wonder why you think a carbon tax is an appropriate way to address fuel poverty. I do not quite follow the logic. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Lord Stern</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I completely agree with you about the importance of energy efficiency and you have probably seen the report of Sir John Hill of the London School of Economics on fuel poverty, which points directly to energy efficiency as being the most important way of helping poorer people cope with energy bills.

What you are doing is stopping giving people something for nothing where that something is deeply damaging. You would expect prices to reflect the costs and that is what this is doing. To call it a tax is to beg that question in some ways. I do not mind calling it tax, but we have to recognise that what it is doing is stopping people doing for nothing something that is deeply damaging, and that is emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">For people of whatever standard of living—and I have worked a lot of my life in very poor economies, particularly 40 years in India and 25 years in China and elsewhere—the best way to overcome poverty is to have a price system that works and have opportunities for work and education and a transfer system that supports those people who are worse off. To price something below market, as I would argue you are doing without the carbon tax, is generally bad economics and bad for growth.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q8 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Lee:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I hear all that and I understand, but back in the political reality in which I have to exist—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Stern</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">:  I do, too.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Lee:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> —the reality is that at the moment coal is extremely cheap. I am sure a lot of people in this country could be employed digging coal out of the ground and I suggest they would tend to be people who are at the bottom end of the income scale. We are not doing that because we have made a political decision to not burn coal.

About 25% of our electricity comes from coal, so what we are discussing is moving away from coal and I think that is something both you and I support. We have to recognise that if you make a transition from one way of generating and using energy to another, it is exactly that it is a transition and there will be some dislocation. It is not win-win-win for everybody, but we have to make that transition for the reasons I and many others have argued.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The policy challenge is to try to do it in a way that gives as little dislocation as possible, but such dislocation as is there is managed. There are going to be people round the world who work in coal who, over the next 20 or 30 years, will gradually have to move into other things. We lost shipbuilding and motor cycles and other things in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and you have to manage those transitions if those kinds of things are happening.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In this case, we are arguing that this should happen. Whether or not we lost shipbuilding, as a piece of economic history you can argue whether it should have happened, but in this case we are arguing quite explicitly that the move away from coal should take place unless, of course, we do carbon capture and storage. I hope that for somewhere between $50 and $100 per tonne of CO</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:8pt; vertical-align:sub">2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, you could have a carbon price that over the medium term could indeed support carbon capture and storage from coal and that, of course, would change that story.

The British Government, both this one and the previous one, based its energy policy on the Stern Review and cite it always to justify its policies, both in detail and in general. In your review you say the cost of mitigating, i.e. preventing, global warming in future will hopefully be 1% of GDP. The benefits of doing so will be upwards of 5% and indeed even higher than 20% of GDP, so benefits would to five to 20 times the costs. But the IPCC in its last report, which came out after yours, concluded that, “Analyses of the costs and benefits of mitigation indicate that these are broadly comparable in magnitude” and so it “could not establish an emissions pathway or stabilisation level where the benefits exceed the costs”.

I am not one of those who say you should not use a low discount rate. If you are entitled to use a low discount rate it is a subjective thing and you give an ethical reason for doing it, but implicitly you do not use that low discount rate in discounting the opportunity cost of the investments that have to be made to prevent it. This is not a point that I have made; Professor Mendelson and others have made it. If you did use the same discount rate to discount the costs of preventing high emissions as you used for the benefits of preventing high emissions the costs would be far higher, would they not?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Lord Stern</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Again, there is so much confusion in the way you put it about the meaning.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q16 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley: </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">I </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">thought</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal"> it was quite clear.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Lord Stern</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: No, it was not. Can I explain to you why it was not? This goes to the heart of much of what we are talking about here. Discounting looks at a benefit that appears some number of years from now in relation to a benefit that might appear now, and that is the discount factor. Those relative values could be worth half as much or they could be twice as much. Discounting could go one way or the other, but that is the idea of discounting.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q17 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Does that not apply to costs as well?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Lord Stern</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It does. Let me go through because this is an important point and obviously we certainly need to go through it with some care. That is the discount factor, that relative value, and the discount rate is the rate that value falls. Of course, it will depend on the good you are looking at and it will depend on the moment in time, so there are many discount rates. In particular, the discount factor and thus the discount rates that emerge will depend on what you assume about whether the people down the track will be better or worse off than we are. I think we share that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Looking back at the Stern Review, I said right at the beginning, Sir Robert, that we were rather optimistic about growth. I think from that point of view discount rates were possibly on the high side if you are looking at consumption benefits going into the future. Then, of course, you have uncertainty, which we took into account explicitly through looking at the expected benefits, looking the various probabilities of different kinds of outcomes. You imply that we ignored uncertainty</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">at one or two points in the paper, which we quite explicitly did not. There is a headline there.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">If you look at the cost side, you are looking at the opportunity cost of different kinds of inputs into that story. On the cost side you are looking at what costs occur to firms in different circumstances and that is why, in many ways, you would use the opportunity costs they face. In a world with very imperfect markets you will find many different kinds of discount rates according to who it is that is facing the problems, because our markets are not perfect. That is why you would not expect to have the same discount rates for all goods, for all activities, for all people.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We use the discount rates appropriate for the question being asked. So when looking at benefits you look at what happens to consumption to people at different periods in the future. If you are looking at the cost side you are looking at the costs that firms face. It is a matter of imperfect capital markets and different kinds of constraints facing different people. You would not expect those things to be the same.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I should add that I was sitting in the Treasury doing this.

The reason that is not a helpful way by itself of appraising investment is it does not look at the detail of the costs and benefits, and that is what you do when you do a cost-benefit analysis.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I think the argument you just put could be set against any investment in the growth context and I do not think you would want to do that, but I come back to the point I made, Sir Robert, right at the beginning. Looking back, I think we were overly optimistic about growth, particularly by that I mean the threat to lives and livelihoods in the future from unmanaged climate change.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q21 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> But what you are effectively saying is that there is a factor in your equation that leads you to put more value on increasing the incomes of people 200 years ahead, from seven times what we earn today to ten times what we earn today, than any reduction in living standards today and over the next 50 years through this process of transition to very high cost sources of energy.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Lord Stern</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: They are not—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> High, excluding the external costs.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Lord Stern</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: They are not very high costs.

If you look at the cost of energy bills from 2004 to 2012, you will see that they have gone up from a bit over £600 to a bit over £1,100. The vast majority of that has been the gas price, and it has not been the green story at all. Probably £30 or £40 of that increase over those eight or nine years might have been green policy. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We have to be very clear that these are not massive costs, but I go back to what I said before. You look at the magnitude of the investments. You look at the benefits from the investments. You look at the incomes of the people to whom they accrue. You look at the uncertainties. That is what we do when we do cost-benefit analysis. You could advance the same argument against any investment in the context of a model or a set of assumptions that assume growth. What I am underlining is that since the Stern Review the assumption of underlying growth, particularly in the context of the magnitude of the risk and the science, is not something I would want to make now. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I do not know if you have read it, but I did send you all an article I published last September, just six weeks or so ago, in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Journal of Economic Literature</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, which is the most prominent place in our academic profession for this type of discussion, where I went through, in great detail, why I felt that those underlying growth assumptions were not appropriate in this kind of context.

You want to look much more broadly. For example, in this context, I have emphasised risk to lives and livelihoods. Unmanaged climate change could lead to hundreds of millions of people having to move and that could result in deep conflict and we could risk very large numbers of deaths as a result of those kinds of moves. If you are writing about the great famine, the Great Leap Forward in China, I think you would want to look at the 30 million or so people who died, and I do not think the first thing you would look at was the GDP series for China through that period. I think this is a very big issue in this context, the risk to lives.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There is the risk to environment itself. As I said, I have been working in China for about 25 years now and those of you who have been to Beijing recently will have seen the deep damage that is done to the environment by the smog there and thus to health. The ways in which communities function are very important. If you look at lives, environment, the functioning of communities—I could go on, but I have mentioned things that are highly relevant to this particular policy context.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q23 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Lee:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Not just economic measures?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Lord Stern</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I do not mind—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Lee:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> In the round, you do not—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Lord Stern</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I do not mind how you classify.

As we do manage that change, we are going to find—going to back to what I said earlier—as we have seen in past waves of technological change, they are full of innovation, learning, discovery, investment and growth. Chris Freeman, who died a year or so ago, was a famous economic historian who looked at waves of technological change, and he began that story with the mechanisation of textiles and went through, as I described, with steam and rail and then on to steel, motor car mass production and then, of course, ICT. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Now you see those waves of technological change bringing innovation, investment and growth, and you are doing things in different ways. That is the opportunity that we have and when we do it I think we will find it is cleaner, quieter, safer, more energy secure and more bio-diverse. I think there is a great future for growth, for a while, of a very different kind and we are seeing lots of discovery. We are learning how to do that.

Computers, rockets, a variety of different inventions that have been driven by the need to win a war and I wonder whether the problem with the whole climate change is that it does not appear like a conflict, but in fact it is. How would you suggest politicians could frame that? To me, that would be a better way of pitching it to the public, instead of hugging polar bears. Do you know what I mean? There is this sense that, yes, people </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">like polar bears but, ultimately, they also like to heat their homes and feed their families.

This is something that is full of risk and uncertainty. We cannot forecast exactly what these effects would be and we know, from psychology and behavioural economics and so on, that people’s understanding and ability to cope with and understand risk and uncertainty is limited. It takes us potentially far outside the range of human experience. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We have not seen 3°C on this planet as global average surface temperature in the 19th century. We have not seen that for 3 million years or so. We have been around as homo sapiens for 250,000 years and basically, our experience and our civilisation is in the holocene period, since the last ice age. I emphasise that because it is not just risk and uncertainty; it is potentially taking us way outside human experience, which we do not deal with very well. It comes with long lags and it is associated with the aggregate of what we do and not what one individual does. In other words, it is all the emissions put together, not just an individual’s emissions. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">If you put that—risk and uncertainty, outside human experience, long lags, and that it is the aggregate not the individual contribution that is the driver—it is about as difficult to mobilise political support as it could be and all of that comes from the science. That is a measure of the difficulty in communication here, but the risks involved are potentially immense, as we have been discussing with, for example, increases of 3°C and 4°C and upwards, which is possible, possibly leading to hundreds of millions of people having to move; rewriting the relationship between human beings and the planet. That is the scale of the risks we face. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In looking at the communications issues, it is very important to dig into the science to see and appreciate exactly what it is that we are trying to communicate. It is not “we getting across to people”.  That is not the right language. It is people as a whole talking this through; if you like, John Stuart Mill’s approach to democracy and Government by discussion. If we, as a community, can discuss and look at these consequences then you will find people increasingly, as many do already, start to recognise the urgency of action. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It is a bit like drunk driving. When I was at university, those laws were not yet there and when they came in there was a great discussion about restriction on individual freedom. We eventually got to the point of regarding drunk driving as irresponsible by discussing the evidence and going over the risks, and I think this is the kind of discussion we need to have. It involves academics like me. It involves institutions like the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">British</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Academy</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and the Royal Society opening up public discussions and it involves politicians like you talking it through in a balanced and evidential way. I do not see any other way of doing it. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In that discussion the kinds of metaphors and illustrations we use will of course make a difference but, ultimately, it is bringing a collective understanding to the immense risks that we face and only there can we see the necessary political will to act strongly. I am not that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">pessimistic, as that political will is increasing in different parts of the world. As I say, the climate change legislation and policies in this country are quite good relative to elsewhere.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q27 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Lee:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You have already made reference to working in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">China</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.

Do you perceive a real challenge of modern democracy and, dare I say it, not great political leadership on the global stage at the moment—I am being very careful in my words. Do you see that as a real problem and a challenge with regards to climate change policy because we are increasingly very much worried about Twitter and tomorrow’s headlines instead of taking a longer term perspective, particularly in western democracies, at the moment?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Lord Stern</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: If you take a long-run view, democracies are quite good at taking stable, reasonable decisions. I already mentioned the Great Leap Forward and Chinese famine as examples of what can go wrong outside democracies. As Amartya Sen has constantly underlined, he is not aware and I do not think any of us are aware of a major famine in a democratic country with good communications and discussion. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I think, on the whole, democracy is the best way of dealing with these things, but this is a particularly difficult subject for public discussion for the reasons I have described. It means there is a greater responsibility on you as politicians, myself and my colleagues as academics, journalists and people in the media, to conduct that discussion in a responsible, measured and evidential way, while underlining the very big risks that we face. I do not think I would take the view that you need some kind of autocratic regime to get to good places. Our climate change legislation did come from all parties getting together in a sensible and evidence-based way and I hope we can continue to do that. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">If you look around the world, I thought President Obama’s speech of June this year in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Georgetown</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">University</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> was pretty strong, setting out an agenda for the second term, which he did not have to do.

It says “anaemic growth” and, broadly speaking, that is an assessment I, as someone who was chief economist to the World Bank and looks carefully at these things still, would share, but that is anaemic growth—positive. Suppose we had zero growth from now on, but no change in technique. We as a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">world would be emitting about 50 billion tonnes of CO</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:8pt; vertical-align:sub">2 </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">equivalent, which is what we are emitting now.

I do not think we should choose one or the other; both are relevant. If two countries trade with each other and one exports stuff that is quite intensive in carbon to somebody else, they both gain from that trade. That is what we teach in economics, in David Ricardo and the gains in trade. They are both involved in the transaction. They are both gainers. I think that both output basis and consumption basis are relevant parts of a discussion and I would not choose one or the other. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">China</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has seen the dangers that it faces. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">China</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is the biggest emitter and it realises that how much it emits directly affects what happens to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">China</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.

It does not necessarily depend on strong growth elsewhere and, if you have been following the Chinese economy and discussions around the 12th and 13th plan, which I have been involved with to some degree, you can see that they are looking for the balance of the economy to shift to domestic demand. They are looking for the share of consumption to go up and they are looking for the composition of that consumption to be more focused on services, much in the way that it is in richer countries. In terms of trade, in terms of the balance between investment and consumption and in terms of the make-up of consumption, they are thinking through all those issues.

Different people build different assumptions into those models and that is why you get a very big range of outcomes. My views on the balance of those models are in print. In the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Journal of Economic Literature</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> piece that I sent to you, looking at the way in which these models were structured, the very modest approach to damages, the optimistic assumptions of growth, the way in which they left out a number of the risks in the science that are relevant—looking at all those things, I argue that, on balance, the integrated assessment models that produce the kind of calculations you just quoted, Mr Lavery, those models systematically underestimate. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">If I just take the one that the Americans have been using, which has been associated with Michael Greenstone of MIT and others, they currently have $35 a tonne of CO</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:8pt; vertical-align:sub">2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:8pt; vertical-align:sub"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">as the cost of carbon</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:8pt; vertical-align:sub"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">and I have argued that that is a gross underestimate.

You would expect different models to give different results. That is the way in which economic discourse takes place. We learn from those models and one thing that I have argued is that, for the reasons I have described in some detail in my piece, those models are giving a rather strong underestimate of the social cost of carbon.

Most of the Stern Review was looking at the different kinds of risks of different kinds of policies in a way that did not depend on the integrated assessment models. That was one chapter in 27 and the rest of the chapters were not based directly on that. They were looking at different kinds of risk in different kinds of ways that, of course, are complementary to that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q33 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Ian Lavery:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The economic models used to derive the social cost of carbon are highly sensitive to input assumptions, including what we have already discussed this morning, which is the choice of discount rates. What is the argument for basing policy on models that appear to the layperson to be overly sensitive to apparently subjective input assumptions?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Lord Stern</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think I have already answered that question, Mr Lavery. You have a range of models that give you different insights into questions. You see how different assumptions affect answers. I suggest that we can come to the conclusion that, looking at those models, they give a lower bound, some benchmark, on the social cost of carbon. I have argued that, say, if you take the Greenstone model that was used in the United States that comes out with $35 a tonne of CO</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:8pt; vertical-align:sub">2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, we can suggest that the carbon price should be much higher than that. That is throwing some light on an argument. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">You should never take one model as the answer to any question and that is not what economic models are about. An economic model is a sentence in an argument. It helps you understand the issues that are involved and, in this case, it helps you understand the magnitudes that are involved because, as I have argued, it puts a lower bound on the social cost of carbon.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q34 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Ian Lavery:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Is this fairly similar to actuarial valuation, with these different inputs?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Lord Stern</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is true that what the actuary thinks about your life expectancy depends on how he models the risks that you face and having a discussion about the assumptions the actuary is making is quite helpful to understanding some of the issues. I think we should see modelling in this kind of spirit. It is explicit and it helps you understand some aspects of the problem, but you should not expect one model to give you a simple, unambiguous answer. If you take a collection of models; if you look outside the models and ask what the big issues are outside the models, then you can come to a balanced judgment on the policy issues and that is what we tried to do in the Stern Review.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q35 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Graham Stringer:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Professor Stern, you are a distinguished academic.

I think we sent you that paper as well. It was subject to very careful assessment and discussion and lively academic discussion, which should be there, but this was a Government report and we shared it with many academics as we were writing it.

At the end of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">day, it is a Government report and it falls into the same category then as the Barker report and the Eddington report of being a position statement of the Treasury at a particular point in time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Lord Stern</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I worked with Sir Rod Eddington on the Eddington report, so I know a bit about that. I chaired the academic advisory panel. He asked me to chair that academic advisory panel. What we did on that is we got together a number of leading academics and we subjected the kinds of arguments that were being put to academic scrutiny. When we were doing the Stern Review, we started putting the team together during the summer, and it was assembled in October of 2005.

I think we went about the Stern Review in a way that was unusually open in terms of seeking out criticism, but you do not submit a 700-page report to the learned journals. That is not the way the learned journals work and we could not ever have done that. What we did do is seek out the criticism and we were open for evidence and I think we were as open and self-critical and sharing as any other Government report that I am aware of.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q37 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Graham Stringer:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Are the Government policies that are being pursued in tackling climate change making progress or are we going backwards?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Lord Stern</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: A little bit like the curate’s egg.

I said earlier in our discussion that these had been somewhat queried or undermined by, for example, returning to possible reviews of the Fourth Carbon Budget, a suggestion that we might be rolling back green levies and so on. I think a good direction is being undermined by uncertainty and Government-induced policy risk, which has been generated by the current discussion.

I think that having a consumption-based measure, along the lines you are describing, and an output-based indication of emissions from a country would be valuable and I think it would be an advantage to set those numbers side by side. If low-cost manufacturing moves out of your country into other countries but you are still consuming those products, then in thinking about the emissions that you are responsible for, that would be one part of the story. I can only reiterate what I said in my answer to Mr Lee. I think both of these measures are of interest and the fact that emissions go up on a consumption-based measure is directly relevant. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q41 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Graham Stringer:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think we agree on that, but isn’t the point that the current policies are producing negative outcomes in terms of what is required and do you not think we should look at them in that context?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Lord Stern</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I certainly think we are not doing enough, and I think in the last few years there has been a real risk of going backwards.

You may or may not accept Liberum’s figures, but it is going to be a lot of money.

I refer you again to the calculations of the Climate Change Committee, who suggest that in the remainder of this decade the overall dual bill, electricity and gas, might go up by £100 or so—8% or 9%—as a result of those policies and that quite a lot of that, perhaps all of it, could be offset by energy efficiency.

To improve investment in R&amp;D you need direct involvement in the R&amp;D itself, but in many cases you are going to encourage activities through private market incentives. For example, feed-in tariffs have been used in different parts of the world for solar and they have encouraged enormous technical progress in solar. I am making a distinction here between R&amp;D in which, I agree with you, we should invest much more but, in addition, I am making the further point that things like feed-in tariffs allow experience and learning on the job and moving to scale. That is what we have seen in solar, where the price per kilowatt hour of a solar panel has dropped by a factor of five or six over the last seven or eight years. That has not been narrow R&amp;D in the sense that people sometimes talk about it. That has been learning by doing, experimenting, the hard grind of engineering and so on. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The same is true with the very big improvement in fuel efficiency of cars.

If you look at what happened, say, to a big American firm like DuPont, they decided to have a very strong focus on energy efficiency and they found a few billion dollars a year. The idea that everybody always explores all the opportunities that are open to them and relentlessly, with full information and magisterial computing abilities, always searches out ways of reducing costs is not something that I would accept. You see in many firms that a very strong focus on energy efficiency produces strong results. We have seen many times that the imposition of emissions standards, for example, often in the face of complaints by car companies, turns out to generate quite a lot of energy efficiency. I do not accept the idea that if you see a £20 note on the street it must be counterfeit, otherwise somebody would have picked it up.

Just two last questions, if I may. Bjørn Lomborg has recently published work saying that your analysis, among others, overestimates the negative impact of global warming and underestimates the benefits and there are a number of immediate benefits, the most obvious being less people dying in the winter if it is warmer, but there are other benefits from global warming. What would be your comment on that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Lord Stern</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Bjørn Lomborg is an entertaining read, but it is not serious scientific research. If you look at Working Groups II and III, which are impact and policy from the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">IPCC, you will see the kind of overall effects that they describe as deeply worrying. We are risking going way outside human experience, as I described before. The reasons for living where we do, which are associated with rainfall, ports, rivers, sea levels, North Indian monsoon and so on, could be radically redrawn over a period of five, 50, 100, 150 years, some effects coming sooner. That is the scale of the effects we face. You will maybe find a few benefits here and there to some places for a while, but those things, for any rational judgment, are way smaller than the kind of risks and the much bigger picture that we see. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I know we are running slightly late, but if there is time for one more set of questions—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Lord Stern</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I have to go and chair a meeting of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">British</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Academy</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q51 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Albert Owen:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I will be very brief, and apologies for not being here at the beginning.
