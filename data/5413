I say “enormous potential”. I guess some members of this Committee have probably been there; you always get the feeling in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> that there is a very lively, free, open society trying to get out, and one day it is going to come good. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q3 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> How strong is our capacity to read </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">?  Has that capacity been better in the past than it is now, or do you think that we have a pretty good understanding of what is going on?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Robert Cooper:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> For myself, every now and then I began to develop a theory about what the Iranians were doing, and then I slapped my wrist and said, “Don’t ever think that you understand them.” There is no doubt that having good people on the ground, particularly </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">people who speak Persian, who know the country and know the people, is invaluable. Can you ever completely understand them? Actually, it is sometimes quite difficult to understand people in this country, so I wouldn’t ever be sure of that, but you can certainly understand them better, and having people on the ground who have experience, knowledge, contacts is always essential. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q4 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Of late, we have taken a fairly cautious approach in our diplomatic relations, rather than being more open.

One should also not get euphoric, either—there is always some thorn with the rose.  Nevertheless, the last election and the arrival of Mr </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Rouhani</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> as President clearly offers an opportunity quite different from anything that we have had for the last 10 years.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q5 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sandra Osborne:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> With regard to who is actually in charge of Iran and the various different structures there, how high is the risk that powers within Iran will block any deal on the nuclear issue?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Robert Cooper:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It is very difficult to understand what is going on inside Iranian politics, and in this issue, the President is not probably the most important single figure. The most important single figure is, I assume, the Supreme Leader, the guide. Nevertheless, experts tell me that President </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Rouhani</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has a very good relationship with Ayatollah </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Khamenei</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, and certainly he has been given some room to take negotiations forward on the nuclear programme. But, over the past 10 years, the less attractive elements of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, the Revolutionary Guard, the militias and so on, have gained an awful lot of influence, and I do not think that it is exactly the same country it was when the first attempt to negotiate with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> started.

What has changed has not been that we have followed </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> policy; rather, it has been that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> policy has converged on what </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Britain</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> at first and then the European Union as a whole was doing: a belief that the problem could be solved through dialogue.

I am sure that they have substantive and reasonable concerns about the Iranian nuclear capability. The word “capability” is always slightly ambiguous, so let us say “nuclear programme”. How much capability they have is not really clear. We share that concern—I think everyone shares that concern—and it is not just a question of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">; it is what this would do across the Gulf. It is an easy prediction to make that, if </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> actually acquired a nuclear weapon, the Saudis would accelerate their relationship with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Pakistan</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.

I used to think that they would really like to have negotiation as an Olympic sport. They are very difficult. They are very tough negotiators, but lots of people are tough negotiators. They are very subtle, and you have to pay a lot of attention to the words. In the initial agreement to suspend enrichment activities, “activities” was not defined sufficiently well. This is the agreement reached with the three Foreign Ministers. As others here will tell you, the Iranian definition of enrichment activities did not include manufacture of centrifuges, so while the agreement was in force, they continued to manufacture centrifuges. They also put together a plant for converting yellow cake into UF6, which you can then enrich—that is a sort of pre-enrichment activity. They followed the letter of the agreement exactly, but were far from following its spirit. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In negotiations with the Iranians, with the long history of our relations with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and all of the different faults we have committed, one gets used to any concession being seized and no concessions being made in return. My most memorable personal experience was a six-hour session with Dr </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Jalili’s</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> deputy trying to agree an agenda for the next meeting. Actually, it was clear in the first 20 minutes that we weren’t going to agree, but I thought in order to convince my principals that we’d better carry on for another few hours first. What were we discussing and at what point did I eventually say, “No, I can’t agree.”? They were trying to arrange the agenda so that the nuclear issue would not be on it. Seeing that the six countries came together to discuss the nuclear issue and that was the only raison d’être of the talks, that wasn’t acceptable. Anyway, the six hours it took to establish that was time well spent.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q19 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Roy:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It was said that, during negotiations between the Iranians and the EU3+3, the Iranians were able to determine what the differences were between the six countries—the six negotiators at the other end of the table—and it was therefore easy to split an opposed negotiating team.

The Russians know them extremely well. They are neighbours and they tried at one point to seize a bit of Iranian territory. They have a complicated relationship with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, but one that has made them quite a lot of money. They are also potentially a big competitor with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, because the largest gas reserves in the world are Russian and the second largest are Iranian.

But, for Europe, we are a little bit closer than </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">China</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is, for example. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">But yes, there are differences, and yes, the Iranians work very hard at exploiting them.

I have no doubt that the sanctions played an important role.

There are many who believe that mistakes were made by both sides in the relationship, but you specifically pointed to 2002-03, when there were overtures by Iran, which the US unfortunately rebuffed—the axis of evil, and all the rest of it. The </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> took a hard-line approach at the time, which in a way led to the fall of President </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Khatami</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, a reformist President, in the elections, which made for a more hard-line approach.

I agree with you. There were mistakes made by both sides. A lot of Iranian behaviour was calculated to make suspicions on our side deeper than they were. But on our side we probably missed an opportunity. There was also a kind of learning process on our side, as I said in answer to an earlier question. Negotiating with the Iranians is quite tough, and you need to be very careful.

Reciprocity was always a key factor for the Iranians and their long-term criticism of the Western approach has been that there wasn’t enough of it to encourage concessions. There are those who believe that the West has gone too far. Do you think we have done regarding the concessions we have made to the Iranians, or is it still all very qualified at the moment?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Robert Cooper:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> No, it is extremely qualified. The critical part—several things are important for the Iranians in this—is the phrase, “enable the repatriation of an agreed amount of revenue held abroad”, because the most important part of the sanctions has been those on financial transactions, which have made it difficult or impossible for oil revenue to reach Iran. I would not like to give you a number because I am not actively involved, but an important question there is, “of an agreed amount of revenue held abroad”. If my understanding is correct, the agreed amount is quite a small proportion of the revenue held abroad, so the concessions made so far are not gigantic. There is a lot more behind. As negotiations continue, particularly with some of the sanctions being suspended, even more revenue will be accumulated, so the incentive to make a deal will become greater over this period.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q29 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Baron:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The critics of the deal would suggest that it still leaves the path open for </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> to enrich uranium. The NPT itself makes very little mention of enrichment. Is that a valid criticism? The French in particular were concerned about the possibility of future enrichment.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Robert Cooper:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Right. With respect to the whole Iranian programme, one can ask why they ever needed to enrich uranium. Normally, someone embarking on a civil nuclear programme starts by getting uranium supplied from someone else, you build the reactor, and you learn how to make a reactor work, as with the reactor in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Bushehr</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> where the fuel is all supplied by </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Russia</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. Enriching uranium is technically difficult and after that you have to learn to fabricate it into fuel, which is just as difficult. Normally, that is the bit you get someone else to do until you have got a really big nuclear programme. The fact that the Iranian programme concentrated exclusively, it seemed, on the part of the nuclear fuel cycle that is dual use is what made everyone—a really mild term—suspicious.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q30 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Baron:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Could it be argued that they were just trying to get to the point of capability? If you look at the Japanese and less so the Germans, you could say that they are similarly at that point, without becoming a nuclear power.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Robert Cooper:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Here is a point at which we do not know what the Iranians wanted—perhaps they did not know either. It always seemed to me that there would be an extremely dangerous moment for them when they took their great stockpile of enriched uranium, for which they have no use at all, and tried to produce weapons-grade material and to turn it into a bomb. If you were lucky, that would take you a year or more, even if it worked, and then you are not sure whether your bomb will work—meantime all hell will break loose. So I always thought that the Iranians had really got a problem: they were piling up this enriched uranium, but not doing anything with it. They could not use it for civil purposes, because they did not know how to, while trying to make a bomb with it would be a very, very high-risk procedure. You could say that they got themselves into a kind of trap.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q31 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Baron:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Finally, Sir Robert, what confidence should Western negotiators have that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> will abide strictly by the terms of any agreement? How sure can we be, given that places like </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Parchin</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> are still a contentious issue?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Robert Cooper:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes, and the example that I always used to quote—I am not sure if I can remember the location correctly—was the place where the IAEA inspectors, in response to some tip-off, were planning to visit. When they got to the site, they found not only that the machinery had all been removed, but that the building had been removed, and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">2 metres</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> of topsoil—apparently because the Iranians had decided to construct a park there.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What we have now—that is why it was wise to make an interim agreement—is a period in which I hope that a new standard of transparency can be set and that the IAEA can get really open access. That is what we ought to watch very carefully. In the past, there have been all kinds of games played, with objections made to this inspector or that inspector, visits delayed and buildings being found to have been cleaned out and repainted—which did not mean to say that all the isotopes had been got out. All of that increased distrust. With the interim agreement, there is now an opportunity to reverse that process and for the Iranians to demonstrate that they are capable of co-operating and being transparent, building a track record.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">If there is a further agreement, I am sure that that will not be an “in one bound Jack was free” agreement.

We know that Anglo-Iranian relations have not always been terribly positive, but they have not necessarily been quite as disastrous as some of the naysayers would like us to think.

There were periods in the 1990s where things were going probably much—I would not want to say “much worse,” but the readings were certainly not as good as they could have been. That really reflected the fact that many of the old hands at the Foreign Office were retiring, and in the absence of an embassy in Tehran, there were really no new people coming up to take those positions.

They are actually quite convinced that you run the show. There are antipathies and animosities. I have written about this issue and looked at it in some detail. It is very interesting to see this, in a way, dichotomous perception. On the one hand, they have this deep antipathy towards all things English. They always say English, by the way—they say “</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Inglisi</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">” rather than “British.” Being north of the border helps, in certain respects. The fact is that they have this sort of wariness of the cunningness of the Brits.

You can see that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I always cite the fact that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Britain</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is still one of the leading destinations for Iranians to travel to and be educated in or whatever. The current President has a doctorate, of sorts, from Glasgow Caledonian university. That was very much promoted in his campaign literature. This is the thing: you think on the one hand that they might think it is terrible that he has had this experience in Britain, but on the other hand, it was promoted very much as a positive that he had this experience in Britain. At least one Iranian academic said to me on a visit, “All our problems started with the seizure of the British embassy in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">2011.”</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I said, “Do you think it’s all of them?

It is interesting, because he thinks that because he was in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Glasgow</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, that basically means that—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q48 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Or an </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Inglisi</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> President.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Ansari</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes, that’s right.

Clearly, overthrowing a democratically elected Prime Minister was probably the lowest point of Anglo-Iranian relations.

I think that those who work on </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> are fully aware of this subtlety and these nuances.

He is also somewhat opaque in his politics. I mean, his championing of liberal and progressive ideas in the June election was a bit of a novelty for many Iranians; they had not really seen that in him before. None the less, he did it, and did it rather well. He was helped by the fact that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Jalili</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, his main competitor, was, in a sense, completely incomprehensible to most people.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There is, in a sense, a view that not only simplifies the power politics in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, but simplifies </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Rouhani</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> as an individual and says, “This man is someone who can do wondrous things and can achieve great things, and basically has a political view that is very clear.” Actually, it has been quite difficult, sometimes, to pin down exactly what his political leanings are.

That is a pity, because </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Britain</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has traditionally been in a very strong position to understand that historical legacy. Also, as I said, that simplification is detrimental to any positive understanding of the future, and not only when it comes to the general lay of the land. We tend to focus or fixate on individuals—I think </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Rouhani</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is one—and see them in much more simplistic political colours than perhaps they have. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q51 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Baron:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Can I develop that even further, while we are talking about a simplistic approach and focusing on one individual?

To what extent is his support grounded in the electorate as a whole? What we would like to know as a Committee is: what strength does he have in his position? What support does he have? Is it simply a case of the Supreme Leader—I suppose the clue is in the title—giving him some slack and seeing what happens? Would it be as simple as cutting him loose? Or is there real popular demand for change that we perhaps underestimate? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Ansari</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> If you want to look at </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Rouhani’s</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> election victory, there are a number of factors that feed into that. One of them has to be the fact that the Supreme Leader was reconciled to the fact that he would win in any modestly free vote. But there are two figures in the background that we have tended to neglect. One of them is </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Khatami</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> himself, and the other one is Rafsanjani. Both of them put a lot of weight behind </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Rouhani</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, and brought their constituencies with them. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">My reading of the situation is that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Rouhani</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> himself does not have the sort of social base that the other two have. Rafsanjani has a very powerful following in many elements of the bureaucracy in the country. He is widely respected in many parts of the Government. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Khatami</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is the one who really has the reformists’ heart and mind, if I can put it that way, and the populism on the street. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The unfortunate thing is that since </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Rouhani’s</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> election in June, both these individuals have been quite badly—I do not want to say hammered, but certainly </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Khatami</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has effectively been disowned. They could not even find the courage to invite </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Khatami</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> to the inauguration; they did not think it was worth the risk. Rafsanjani, for two or three months, played a much more prominent role and made a number of speeches and very interesting comments, but he has since come under more and more attack. If you look at the constellation of Iranian politics as a negotiation in some ways—I am probably guilty of simplifying to some extent as well, of course—between </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Khamenei</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, Rafsanjani and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Khatami</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, I would have to say, in the last two to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">three months, you are seeing </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Khamenei</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> reasserting himself in quite an aggressive way, and doing it with the support of the Revolutionary Guards and others. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Rouhani</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has made a lot of promises. One of the reasons why I was genuinely surprised that he won is that the promises he made in his election were extraordinary. They were way beyond almost anything that people had expected. I personally felt there was absolutely no way he could achieve them. He would not be able to fulfil those promises. The truth of the matter is that among the big promises he made was the release of all these political prisoners, a much </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">desecuritised</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> atmosphere, improved human rights and this, that and the other. A generous interpretation would say that at the moment, it is work in progress. I do not think he has made a huge amount of progress on these particular things. The Government focused more on the foreign policy aspect than the domestic. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q52 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Baron:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">  Can I push you further, Professor?

Is he perhaps reflecting a bit of a shift in Iranian public thinking on this issue? How well grounded is he? To what extent does he reflect the wishes of his people? On one hand, we are told that they are absolutely tired and fed up with sanctions, but on the other hand, we hear experts say, “Actually, this is a matter of national pride, and sanctions have had only a marginal effect.” </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Ansari</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I am of the view that—this goes back to the view about </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Khatami’s</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> support during the election, and his backing </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Rouhani</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and bringing the constituency with him. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Khatami</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> said very clearly ahead of the election—“This is not the time for sulking.” The big worry was lack of turnout and poor turnout. He basically encouraged his followers—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">if the majority of Iranians, certainly by my reading, are given an opportunity to express their preferences, their preferences are basically for a normalisation of relations with the West. One of the things that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Rouhani</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has promised for instance, which is symbolic but is testament to this mood, is that there will be direct flights between </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Tehran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">New York</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. Frankly, that is the least of their concerns in many ways, but clearly this is something that he thinks will garner a certain amount of support. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I think that yes, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Rouhani</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> reflected that. He understood and could see after 2009 and the huge uprising that followed that you do not want to go through another fiasco like that. There had to be someone who could reflect that popular sentiment. If you looked at the crowds coming out, even in the last election, it was quite striking that, despite the repression that had occurred—let’s not have any illusions about it—people were quite courageous in the chanting that was going on in the two weeks up to—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q53 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Baron:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Very briefly, though, Professor, can I press you again, perhaps in a different way?

I am not so confident that people would be that willing to rush out, but the fear is certainly there. We have to marry this to the state of the economy, which is in an extremely parlous state. If </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Rouhani’s</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> promise is not at least even partially fulfilled, then I think their worry is that you are going to see a certain amount of backlash on the streets.

In many ways, there has been a convergence, in part because the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Ahmadinejad</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Administration did a fantastic job of unifying almost everyone against </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’s objectives.

There are both pros and cons, by the way. I wouldn’t want to put it all one way, but there is an element of seeing things in a political, far too short-term way. I think you have to see things in a much more strategic, long-term way to see where the strategic interests of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> lie.

No—the real lesson that has to be learned is that, actually, it is the simplification that is wrong.

I know that people in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> are beginning to question what the point of all this was over the past 10 years and what they have been doing.

There is a fear of giving too much away, because what will happen to you when you get home? There is that element. That has always been a hindrance in many ways. Ignoring the nuclear negotiations, even business negotiations with Western companies in the 1990s were tortuous, for the very reason that nobody wanted to appear to give away too much to a Western company—even though, frankly, it would have been in the mutual interest to get a really good oil or gas deal set up in the 1990s. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q66 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mike Gapes:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The joint plan of action owes a great deal to a shift in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> approach that you alluded to.

There was clearly a shift. To be perfectly honest, right from 2009 the Obama Administration have been saying, “We are open to some sort of negotiation or some sort of opening.” It is just that, obviously, the election crisis in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> that year put paid to all that. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It is a rare occasion—this is why a lot of people have been very hopeful and optimistic about it—when we have had that sort of marginal area, where both the Iranians and Americans have been willing to sit down and engage in a very serious way.

I have to say that the European translation was pretty good. The one that was slightly different was the American version, because the State Department issued pointers, which were slightly different, and that had to do with some aspects of the lifting of sanctions on insurance. The European and Iranian translations were pretty good, and they reflected each other rather well. In that sense, for me, I think the agreement is a good one, and I agree with others about that.

They did not take seriously the oil embargo that the Europeans imposed in July 2012, and they had not invested in the future of the country. Therefore, at the moment, the situation is dire, and those serious economists in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> understand that it will be years, not months, before the situation improves. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q71 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We could get to a situation where after six months, we get there and there is not much happening, and the hawks will be calling for the re-imposition of the sanctions that were lifted.

If you look, going back to John Baron’s comment earlier, at what Iranians want, Iranians want basically very similar things to what ordinary people want.

Certainly from the American side, if you look at Obama’s election in 2008 to 2009 and his approaches to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Khamenei</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> well before anything broke out in the Arab spring or </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Syria</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> or whatever, they would have been amenable to some sort of negotiation and some sort of negotiated settlement.

That might be the best way of putting it. The thing is that they wanted to find alternative means of getting to the solution.
