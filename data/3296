font-size:11pt">In order to remain relevant to its membership of over 600 households, HRA provides a focal point for issues of concern to members and provides help and advice to members when they are dealing with their Local Authority.  The increased use of information technology by our local authority presents a significant barrier to HRA members if they are not IT literate.  This gives rise to a significant amount of casework for HRA Officers, particularly in the realms of planning control, planning enforcement and other environmental issues.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt;

font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">This has resulted in decisions made by Council Officers becoming more difficult to challenge for both Members and the general public.  Pressures on finances and increasingly demanding timescales for completing tasks such as determining planning applications have encouraged Officers to take decisions under delegated authority that appear to be based on administrative convenience rather than compliance with legislative requirements and/or published procedures.  This in turn challenges fundamental principles of democratic control of local government.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt;

font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">To retain democracy within local government it is essential that there is a simple and inexpensive way in which the public can hold its local authority to account, and challenge decisions that appear to owe more to administrative convenience or political expedience than they do to compliance with written procedures or delivery of public service.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt;

font-size:11pt">The LGO will not investigate a complaint unless the complainant “has suffered serious loss, harm or distress as a direct result of the council’s faults or failures”.  This does not allow a residents’ association to act on behalf of its members.  Probably less than 5% of members of the Heston Residents’ Association would be able and willing to pursue an issue with their local authority or with the LGO in an individual capacity.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt;

font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The assessment of the degree of “seriousness” of the loss, harm or distress allows the LGO to consider every complaint to be insufficiently serious.  It can therefore be used as a mechanism to balance officer caseload against available officer resources.  Clearly anyone who goes to the considerable trouble of submitting a complaint to the LGO considers that his or her complaint is serious. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt;
