As you know, we have pursued this with the Foreign Secretary, who gave us an absolutely clear statement of policy in his oral evidence on 7 February 2012. I asked him for his confirmation that, as far as arms exports and internal repression are concerned, this was the policy of the Government: “</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We will not issue licences where we judge there is a clear risk that the proposed export might provoke or prolong regional or internal conflicts, or which might be used to facilitate internal repression</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.” The Foreign Secretary replied: “</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That is still the policy. The </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">‘</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">or</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, as you have pointed out on other </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">occasions, is important.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">” Secretary of State will you confirm that you agree that that is the policy, as stated by the Foreign Secretary to this Committee?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Vince Cable:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> My understanding is that the phrase “clear risk”, which is embedded in criterion 2, is indeed the criterion we use. I am sure it was not in the Committees but subsequently I think there was some commentary that the Foreign Secretary was saying something different. I am fairly confident that across Government we say exactly the same thing and we are following the criteria established, the consolidated eight criteria. That is the way we operate. There is no difference between us. I think the Foreign Secretary is coming before you at the beginning of January. If there is any misunderstanding, I am sure he can clear that up. Mr Bell, do you want to add to that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q49</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I just want to take evidence from the Business Secretary here. Business Secretary, we are quite clear about the position of the Foreign Secretary. It is as I have quoted it and as he has stated it to the Committee. We are not clear whether you endorse the policy.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Vince Cable:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Of course—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> May I continue? The policy is not made up just of clear risk as the Foreign Secretary made perfectly clear. The policy is “</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We will not issue licences where we judge there is a clear risk that the proposed export might provoke or prolong regional or internal conflicts, or which might be used to facilitate internal repression.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">” Do you accept those words are the Government’s policy?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Vince Cable:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> That is a very clear statement, which I would happily endorse. It is my understanding that that is what criterion 2 says. We don’t have independent policies on this.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q50</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I am delighted to hear you say that, Secretary of State, but I am afraid that is wholly at variance with the letter which your Minister of State wrote to me after the Westminster Hall debate, in which he focused solely on the first part of that sentence. The policy is made up of two strands. The policy, which appears in the policy paragraph before the listing of the criteria, which was originally done, as you know, in October 2000, contains the words: “An export licence will not be issued if the arguments for doing so are outweighed by the need to comply with the UK’s international obligations and commitments” and—this is the crucial phrase—“by concern that the goods might be used for internal repression”. That is the basis of the Foreign Secretary’s second part of the policy statement. We wished to have your assurance, which you have now given to the Committee, that that policy statement, appearing in that paragraph, also represents the policy of the Government, coupled with what is said in criterion 2, in which there is the reference to “clear risk”. It is a two-strand policy, correctly stated by the Foreign Secretary to the Committees, and you yourself have now endorsed the Foreign Secretary’s statement.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Vince Cable:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes, it absolutely is the case that we would not endorse licences relevant to internal repression, as well as conflict. I don’t think there is any</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">misunderstanding—certainly there is none on my part. If I may say so, I think that, as a result of the exchange of correspondence with the Minister of State, a comma was inserted that had not been there before and this has been used to create the impression that there was some difference of policy, which there certainly isn’t. The two strands are absolutely inherent in our licensing criteria. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">[Interruption.] </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Can I just ask Mr Bell to clear this up, because I know he has been involved in the correspondence?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q51</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Can I just respond to that point? Your official can certainly come in then. I am very pleased to hear what you say; that is very reassuring to the Committees. However, I have to point out to you what your Minister of State said, and it is not the first time, in something coming from your Department, that the only reference to policy has been the reference to the “clear risk” part of the policy, ignoring the second part. This is what your Minister of State said in his letter to me following the Westminster Hall debate on 2 December: “I can confirm that the Government’s policy is set out clearly and unambiguously in Criterion 2: Her Majesty’s Government will not issue an export licence if there is a clear risk that the proposed export might be used for internal repression. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">This policy has been applied consistently by successive Governments since 2000. This is the policy we apply now and there has been no change to policy.”</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I must point out to you that that is not the correct statement of policy. The correct statement of policy is the one that was made by the Foreign Secretary to these Committees on 7 February 2012 and which, I am glad to say, you have endorsed today.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Vince Cable:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes, indeed. You are correct: there has been absolutely no change in Government policy at all. Certainly we would not issue an export licence if there was a clear risk that the exports might be used for internal repression. That is not an—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q52</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> That is not the totality of the policy. It is, after the comma, “or which might be used to facilitate internal repression”, which is a wider policy than having to demonstrate clear risk. That is the crucial point.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Vince Cable:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think that the issue revolves around this comma, which was inserted, as I understand it, inadvertently in the Minister of State’s letter. The policy is unchanged.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q53</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> With respect, the comma is irrelevant. It doesn’t matter really whether there is a comma. The sentence is made up of two parts, divided by an “or”. There are two strands of policy and have been since the year 2000: one is the “clear risk” strand and the other is “which might be used to facilitate internal repression.” The Committees unanimously attach great importance to both strands featuring in the Government’s policy. That has been endorsed by the Foreign Secretary. You have endorsed it today.

On 15 May, you published that it would start in October and users of the system would have to report quarterly. By 31 July, it was made clear that they would not report quarterly, but annually, the reporting period will be next year—2014—and they will not be required to report the category or goods description. It has moved from a very detailed statement to a rather less detailed statement produced annually, and some of the comments we have had are that it will be of very little value because it will be so late and so lacking in detail that it will not help the process of transparency. First, may I ask why you changed the rules in such a short period of time from the original to what it now is?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Vince Cable:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I will happily explain. Our starting point is that we should have as much transparency as possible in the process—I think, Chair, that you acknowledged that in the recent debate in Parliament. I endeavoured in the first statement to push </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">thos</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> as far as we possibly could with the open licensing, and we set out a new set of procedures.

In one particular case that you may have been in Parliament to hear about, one of our colleagues referred to a company that he represented—a quite substantial employer—which was choosing between ourselves and the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> as a base, and concluded that our system under the revised arrangement would be substantially more bureaucratic.

The licence has strict conditions. It provides that companies are allowed to possess or move only very limited quantities of weapons at any one time. I think it is limited to four firearms. It does not allow them to have automatic weapons, and there are strict conditions on storage and control of the weapons. For example, companies must maintain ownership and control of the weapons. They are not allowed to give or sell the weapons to anyone else. At the time of creating the licence, we needed to provide a flexible solution to allow these companies to operate in the way that they need to operate in order to provide their services, but we felt that by building those strict conditions into the licence we could limit the risk of the weapons being diverted to undesirable end users. At the time, we wrote to the Committees with information about that licence, explaining how it would work, so we have been quite clear about what the licence is intended for and how it is structured.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q73</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Fabian</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Hamilton</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You mentioned the code of conduct.

The implication for the Committees of you not being prepared to name those companies publicly is that we are not able to take public evidence from them.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In your letter to me of 25 October, you set out three justifications for refusing to give these Committees the companies’ names. I dealt with those justifications in turn in the Westminster Hall debate. Those were, in summary, that you felt you were bound by provisions of the Freedom of Information Act; you were concerned about reputational risk to the companies; and you highlighted that one company had expressed concerns, although no evidence was provided, that it might put some individuals in that company at risk.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Subsequent to the Westminster Hall debate, I took advice from the Clerk of the House on your first point as to whether the Freedom of Information Act provisions have any relevance in this context. He replied, “You asked me to confirm that House of Commons Select Committees are not governed or circumscribed by the Freedom of Information Act with regard to the evidence they seek in the course of their inquiries. I can readily confirm that proposition.” The Clerk of the House concludes his letter in reply to me by saying, “In conclusion, the Freedom of Information Act does not prevent your Committees from requesting the names of the requestors granted licences for dual-use chemicals for </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Syria</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> between 2004 and 2012, nor does the Act preclude the Secretary of State from providing those names.” I think that deals with the Freedom of Information Act point.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">As far as the other two arguments are concerned, I merely repeat what I said in the Westminster Hall debate: namely that if witnesses to Select Committee inquiries could claim that possible reputational risk to themselves, or possible unsubstantiated, non-evidenced possible risk to a member of their staff, would be valid grounds for not appearing before them, that would have more or less collapsed the entire Select Committee system. These Committees would not be willing to establish any such precedent, which would have far-reaching implications for the Select Committee scrutiny system in the House of Commons.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In the end of my remarks in the Westminster Hall debate, I said that in the light of the points I had made, I hoped that you would reconsider your position. Can you now tell the Committees whether you have reconsidered your position, and if so, whether you will now agree to give us the names, so that we can use those names publicly and ask the companies to give public evidence to the Committees?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Vince Cable:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I have made a proposal to you, so that you can have a discussion with the companies concerned. I think there were several steps in your preamble that I would like to go over, to explain how we got where we are, if you don’t mind. My starting point throughout is that I would like the companies to give you evidence but there are various, I think legitimate, reasons why we cannot just hand over the names.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">If you don’t mind, let me just go over the sequence. We are dealing with five licences applying to two companies in the period before 2012. Those were toothpaste material manufacturers. Subsequent to 2012 there was one company involved in two licences to supply material that was going to be used for aluminium windows. That was the basis of their application. The second were never sent, as you know, because the European Union regulations came in. That was what actually happened.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In terms of making available the names so that you can cross-question the companies on that, I asked them whether they would waive confidentiality. All our applicants give information on a confidential basis; that is the basis on which export licensing operates. I asked if they were happy to waive that, because I thought it would be good for the Committees and public interest if they were to appear. One company was happy to do so; the other two were not. I could see that that created a difficulty for your Committees. I then proposed that we take advantage of precedent and invite the companies here on the basis that they give you evidence on a confidential basis. Two of the three companies involved are happy to do that; the other is not.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I think the reasons are perfectly plausible and common sense when you reflect on them. You are a mainstream manufacturer, producing common substances, hundreds of thousands of tonnes of which are produced all over the world, which are wholly innocuous. There is no suggestion that they have behaved in any way improperly. What they fear, I think understandably, is that articles might appear in a newspaper saying, “Company X involved in chemical weapons probe”, with names, addresses and individuals. If I were in that company, I would quite reasonably be concerned about the fallout from that. That is why they are reticent to give evidence.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I am anxious to be as co-operative as possible with you. We do not wish to have a dispute between the Government and the Select Committees. You have a job to do and we do. That is why I put forward the proposal that you hear them on a confidential basis, and that way you can check out the story that they have given.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q99</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Secretary of State, I stated in the Westminster Hall debate why the compromise you have put forward was not satisfactory: it prevents the Committees from reporting on or citing the evidence that they received, and prevents them performing their paramount duty of reporting to Parliament. That remains the position.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">You cite confidentiality of your dealings on export licences, but the reality, as I listed in the Westminster Hall debate, is that you have been prepared to disclose all the other key items with just one exception, which is the names of the companies. You have disclosed the dates of approval of the licences, the chemicals that were approved, the quantity of the chemicals approved in each case, the financial value of each contract and the name of the bodies in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Syria</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> to which the licences were granted. So much for confidentiality. You have been prepared to disclose, in response to questions we have put to you, all that information. The one and only piece of information that you are not prepared to disclose publicly is the names of the companies. That does not seem to us to be an acceptable position.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">As for your arguments about reputational risk and so on, any number of Select Committee inquiries are going on all the time in which witnesses could say, “Well, there is a possible risk to my reputation if I come before this Committee.” It is the reality of life that, if Select Committees are to do their job properly, they have to call witnesses and take public evidence.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I will make this point. The issue for these Committees is your Department and the handling of these licence applications within your Department. Very significantly, another item you have disclosed is that not one of these single export licences was put to Ministers, despite it being well known that those are precursor chemicals for the manufacture of chemical weapons; that Syria is one of the largest holders of chemical weapons in the world; and that Syria is a non-signatory of the chemical weapons convention. Despite all those things being in the public domain, according to the evidence you have given us in writing, not one of those export licences was ever put to Ministers.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">This is a necessary and proper area of inquiry for these Committees to explore in a public and open fashion. Once again, Secretary of State, I am asking you to consider what we have said to you and to reconsider your position, and tell us whether you will, after reflection, enable us to take public evidence from the companies concerned, as part of our scrutiny of your Department.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Vince Cable:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I will obviously consider what you have said and the strength of feeling with which you have expressed it, but I do not think we can change the position we have adopted. Can I just make two points? First, there is an enormous difference between the confidentiality that is sought in hundreds of Select Committee inquiries by people who are worried about their reputation, and the problem we are faced with here of a company making fairly standard chemical products at risk of being accused indirectly or by innuendo of being involved in chemical weapons exports, with all the horrendous consequences of that. I think that is a unique situation.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Secondly, under the international classification, the chemicals are dual-use products. I think my Department quite reasonably did not refer them to Ministers by applying a bit of common sense. After all, toothpaste and cleaning fluids for windows are not, by most people’s understanding, chemical weapons. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Domestos</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is a weapon of mass destruction because it </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">contains chlorine; nitrogenous fertilisers are weapons of mass destruction, as the IRA demonstrated. We would not in normal circumstances regard these standard products, manufactured in hundreds of factories all over the world on a large scale, as subject to risk. I think it was perfectly reasonable that my officials showed a little common sense in applying the licensing criteria.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">You have obviously expressed yourself very strongly. I shall have to reflect on your views. My wish is to be as helpful as possible, but I think the request for confidentiality by the companies concerned is reasonable, and I hope I have given you those reasons.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q100</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I will just say finally to you that your comments seem almost to put the companies and your Department into equivalent positions. They are absolutely not in equivalent positions. The companies are commercial organisations, carrying out perfectly normal business in civil activities, to which you have referred—toothpaste manufacture, aluminium window frames and so on. That is a totally legitimate undertaking, and as you have rightly pointed out and I have confirmed to you, they took entirely the right steps to make the necessary export licence application as those are dual-use chemicals.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The responsibility lies with Government and your Department. It is your Department that has access to all the necessary intelligence information. It is your Department that has access to the nature of the bodies in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Syria</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> to whom the chemicals were going. It is your Department that has the intelligence enabling it to judge the risk of any of these bodies being, basically, front companies under the control of the Assad regime or someone else from which they might be able to obtain quantities of these chemicals. All that information lies within Government</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. All those issues are the</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Government’s responsibility. I put it to you that it is not reasonable to suggest that there is some form of equivalence between the company and the Government. This was a Government decision, and the Government alone could take the decision in light of the intelligence and information that it alone has.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Vince Cable:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> That is absolutely correct, Chair, and we fully understand that. That is why it is absolutely right that you question the Department and the officials involved about why they made the decision and whether that was reasonable.

These chemicals require an export licence to all destinations outside the EU, and that has been the case for a very long time—it pre-dated May 2011. Those assessments were made. An assessment against the consolidated criteria was undertaken. It took us about five or six months to undertake that assessment. We looked at all the available evidence. We found no information that was sufficiently strong to suggest that there was any risk of diversion to any illicit activity, and on that basis there were no grounds to refuse the licence under the criteria and so the licences were granted. That was the process we went through; it is the standard process. As Mr Bell said, he reviewed the process and found that it was a reasonable process to undertake. So we stand by the decision that was taken at the time. In hindsight, I can see how it looks problematic, but on what we knew at the time it was the right decision.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q109</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Secretary of State, I am concerned by the responses from both your officials.

I find it extraordinary that, with that combination of factors, your Department should have still approved those two licences in January 2012. When your officials say, “Well, we don’t do anything until something has actually </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">happened in terms of treaty,” I have to say that that is completely contrary to a whole series of steps which you have rightly taken on a precautionary basis.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">You have been informing these Committees and the House of precautionary halting of various arms exports to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Argentina</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.

That was the judgment they made, and I have to say it seemed reasonable.

Reference was made to “immediate licensing suspension to countries experiencing a sharp deterioration in security or stability.” That is generally to be welcomed, but it subsequently seems that it was not entirely clear how and when the suspension would be applied, and we were told that the only time it was applied was when the situation in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Egypt</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> deteriorated so badly, so the first question is: how high has the bar been set?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The second question is: at what point do you actually suspend a licence? If a two-year licence is exhausted, it doesn’t matter—it is finished—but if it is extant, there is still the potential to supply. It was not entirely clear what would be suspended at what point, but I guess people would hope that, once you had decided that the situation had deteriorated and arms should not be supplied, you should have the capacity to stop any shipments immediately. However, that appears not to be the case—or can you explain precisely how it works?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Vince Cable:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Let me explain.

I did introduce the suspension process, and this partly reflects our earlier discussion of the very good examples you used of what happens when the licensing Government are faced with a rapidly evolving situation. The suspension mechanism, which I think I presented to the House, related to new applications and applications in process. When the European Union introduced their suspension mechanisms for </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Egypt</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, they went further—the bar was lower, and it applied to extant licences. Perfectly understandably, that has created some confusion, and I think the view we now take in the Department is that what we need is clarity and simplicity. The European Union suspension mechanism seems to us to be sensible. We are thinking about how we can assimilate it into our existing processes, so that we do not have a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">British system and a European system operating on different principles.

The public would take the view that you have issued a licence in good faith, let us assume, in a situation where the licence was justified.

The public would therefore expect any shipment that is ready to go to be stopped, but it appears that that is not the case and only new licences are stopped or not applied.

At this stage, certainly on standard individual export licences, we are around 80% on the primary target, which is 70% within 20 working days, and we are actually at about 98.5% on the new secondary target that we introduced this year, which is 99% within 60 working days.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We have seen improvements also in processing times for open individual export licences, where some 75% are now being processed within 60 working days against a 60% target. So we have seen improvements in that area. There is one area where we’ve still got some work to do and that is the handling of appeals. I take personal responsibility for that because I am one of the people who looks at appeals as I am not involved in the day-to-day process of approving licence applications. Looking at 2012, we had around 22 appeals and only five, I’m afraid, were completed within the target of 20 working days. So we’ve got to do some work there. Some of those cases are quite complex. They will involve going to Ministers and as a consequence will take extra time to process. But it is an area that we really do need to improve.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q123</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mike </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Crockart</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes. That is a bit of an understatement, to be honest. Looking at the statistics for the last five years, this has been a long-term problem.

It feels a bit late to be sitting here saying, “We are aware of this and we are looking at this.” It is a trend.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Edward Bell:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It is never too late to put things right, of course.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q124</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mike </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Crockart</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes, but what has gone wrong?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Edward Bell:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think this is about the resources.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q125 Mike </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Crockart</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">: </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Why has this not got the priority that it obviously needs?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Edward Bell:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think because the focus has been elsewhere in terms of the processing time for licences.
