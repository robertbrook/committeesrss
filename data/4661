May I start with a warm welcome to each of the three witnesses before us? Thank you very much indeed for coming, especially given that it is so close to Christmas. It might help you and the Committee to know that we will try to whizz through the very specific questions that we have, so that we can hear as wide a spectrum of information as possible. We will have a further session in January, and we hope to have a report that will feed into whatever action the Government are taking.

I am Matthew Quinn, and I am the Environment Director for the Welsh Government. I will just say a little in terms of background. We have had the charge since 1 October 2011. It is a minimum charge of 5p on all single-use bags, regardless of material, and it is for all retailers, regardless of size. That was a conscious decision, in terms of the rationale for doing this, which was around total, rather than specific, environmental impacts. The proceeds are passed on, through a voluntary agreement, from retailers to charities, or causes of their choice. A large number of retailers are signed up to that voluntary agreement. There are specific exceptions to the charge, which are largely around public health and safety issues, such as unwrapped food and the like. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We will come to some of the details of the design later. We really want to understand at the very start what lessons of best practice you learned from other countries while designing your scheme. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Matthew Quinn:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We looked quite widely at all the different countries, at both voluntary and legislative schemes. There were not many that were looking at the totality of impact; a lot of them were about specific impacts. We learned quite a lot from the Irish experience, in terms of the risk of substitution effects from targeting specific types of bags, and also in terms of reactions to levels of charging. That significantly informed the work that we did. I do not know whether colleagues want to offer anything on that. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Poortinga</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> My name is </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Wouter</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Poortinga</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, and I am a reader in environmental psychology at </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Cardiff</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> university. I conducted an evaluation for the Welsh Government of the carrier bag charge. I also conducted a literature review of other initiatives that have been taken around the world, most of which have been pricing-based policies or instruments, and most of which have been shown to be effective. Overall, there is not a huge variety of schemes that have been reported in the academic literature, so it is very difficult to say what the relative effectiveness is of different instruments. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q3</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> But I think it was your evidence that shows that some countries were able to achieve reductions in bag use of 50% to 90% in the short term. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Poortinga</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> That is correct, yes. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q4</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I just wonder what factors make that happen. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Poortinga</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> As I said before, not all of them have been evaluated, and I looked only at the schemes that have been evaluated. They have shown a reduction of 50% to 90%, or 95%. It is very difficult to say what the factors are, as I said, because there is not a huge variation in those schemes, but you can see that most of the pricing-based policies have been effective, irrespective of the size of the levy. The most effective ones are those with the highest charge, such as the one in Ireland, but ones with smaller charges, including in Wales and the US, with charges of 5p or 5 cents, can produce a similar kind of effect, so in this case, size does not really matter.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q5</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Did you wish to add to that, Dr Swannell? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Swannell:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> My name is Richard Swannell, and I am a director of WRAP.

In advance of what happened in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Wales</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, the basic evidence was that the pricing strategy seems to lead to a rapid and significant decrease in the use of bags.

Did you think again about the price level that you set?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Matthew Quinn:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We originally consulted at 7p, and that was set after economic work, in terms of looking at what would not create economic </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">disbenefit</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> but would create sufficient incentive. In the course of the consultation, retailers in particular felt that 5p, which was a figure they were used to using, and which</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Marks &amp; Spencer</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and others have had experience of having an effect, would be a better sum, so on reflection, in the consultation, we went for 5p. The range of figures is up to about 90% in terms of initial impact; we have figures, in terms of the total range, in the high 70s. The 5p figure seems to have had a significant impact, certainly in terms of what we were particularly looking for, which was discouraging single use—that is, getting people to reuse bags. The evidence that we and colleagues have collected suggests that has had an impact, and that people are now used to bringing a bag to go shopping, so it has been useful, even at a 5p charge.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q7</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mrs </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Spelman</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> When you were looking around at other countries, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Italy</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> went out on a limb in the EU and decided to ban plastic bags altogether.

Also, in terms of looking at all bags rather than a specific type of bag, and wanting to create behaviour change, a ban does not clearly address that; obviously, you need bags and you want behaviour change, and a ban effectively does not relate to either of those issues, so it was not something we pursued. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q8</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mrs </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Spelman</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> In your first comments, you said that a lot of this is covered by voluntary agreements, but how do you therefore enforce the charge, and have you ever prosecuted anyone for not charging this levy on the use of the plastic bags? </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Matthew Quinn:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> To clarify, it is only the use of the proceeds from the charge that is voluntary at the moment. We have some reserve powers that we took to direct payment. However, given that at the time the only powers we had were to direct the proceeds to environmental causes, and that we had quite strong representations from the industry that it had established charitable relationships that it wanted to continue, we decided to stick with a voluntary agreement on that, which has raised—from the 43 retailers whose results we looked at—more than £4 million for charities since it started.

Some of this came originally from a petition that was raised, which particularly mentioned plastic bags as the focus. We particularly commissioned a piece of work from the Environment Agency, which was then our principle adviser, on the total environmental impact of different single-use bags. It was clear from that that most of the alternative materials actually had a greater impact on the environment, in total, than did a light-gauge, single-use plastic bag. Given that our approach was to look at total resource use and attitudinal change—also, to be honest, we considered simplicity for the consumer—we took the decision to go with all bags and all retailers.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q12</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Martin </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Caton</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I have a question for Dr </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Poortinga</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.

The voluntary measures that I have found in the literature could reduce plastic bag or carrier bag use, but far less effectively—they are almost half as effective as a charge or a complete ban.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q13</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Martin </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Caton</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We have received submissions describing the Government’s proposals for </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> as complex and potentially sending out conflicting messages.

So in any of the major retailers or firms, as you go in—typically, either on the door or by the counter—you will see a notice saying, “This is what we have raised from the charge and this is the cause on which it was spent.” Certainly, in terms of that acceptability of this being something that is creating positive social impact, that is there.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It is less clear—this is some of the other research—that it, in itself, has yet been seen to engender other positive environmental behaviour, but then the attitudes to waste and recycling were quite high in Wales anyway, because of our other activity.

Because it has been quite clearly established that people use single-use bags at home for bin bags. Also, if you are having to pay for a small or a thin bag, would you prefer a thicker bag? Those are two other areas that we looked at. Interestingly, on “bags for life”, the sales increased substantially directly after the charge was put in, by about 130%, roughly speaking, whereas in the rest of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, it stayed constant.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Also, we saw an increase in the number of swing bin bags and normal bin bags, but not refuse sacks and not nappy bags, to give you an example. So definitely people were switching to buying bags, whereas previously they had been using single-use bags. Take those both into account, though, and the net benefit for </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Wales</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> was still significant. The “bags for life” wiped off about 30% of the reduction and the bin bags another four, so overall the impact has been a substantial net positive.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q18</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Offord</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Would you like to predict what trend we are likely to see in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, if a ban was not introduced—or rather a charge was introduced?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Swannell:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We have been charting the data from about 2006.

It depends on how you value it. What we have always said as an organisation is that people should reuse the bags they like again and again and recycle them at the end of their life. That will lead to a net environmental benefit. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q21</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Zac Goldsmith: </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Moving along the panel, are there</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> any circumstances in which you would want to introduce charges for “bags for life” in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Wales</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Matthew Quinn:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We are consulting on a future environment Bill—we have just finished an environment White Paper—and we have flagged up the possibility that we might take reserve powers in that area to ensure a differential.

It sends confusing messages as well, because it is such a small part of our environmental impact. By focusing on this area, you are potentially misleading the general consumer to think that we are dealing with an issue of far greater significance than it is. My personal position, and our industry’s position, is that this takes us away from areas that we should really focus on that have far more environmental impact.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Neil Sinden:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It won’t surprise you to hear that CPRE disagrees with that view. You might argue that in terms of volume of waste and by weight—on that simple measure alone—it is a relatively small issue that is distracting, but that is a narrow way of looking at the problem. Single-use bags, and plastic carrier bags in particular, are a huge litter problem. Keep Britain Tidy says that they are found in one in 10 litter sites, but we think that that is an underestimate. They are very conspicuous in terms of their volume and the fact that they get blown around. They are among the largest items of litter found in one in 10 littered sites, so we think there is a broader perspective to take on this. Waste by weight is one perspective, but it is very narrow.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">On the pro-environmental behaviour that we think a charge of this kind can encourage, there are huge benefits to be had. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Andrew </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Opie</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think I would agree to a certain extent with Barry. We are dealing with what we would consider to be bigger environmental impact issues at the moment alongside carrier bags. Food waste, for example, has a much more significant impact on the environment, and there is the whole general issue around sustainable consumption and production as well, but we understand that carrier bags have attracted a lot of attention over the years, certainly with the moves in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Wales</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Northern Ireland</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> now.

We are part of the Break the Bag Habit campaign group, which includes the Marine Conservation Society, as well as Keep Britain Tidy, Surfers Against Sewage and the greening the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Thames</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> initiative. The Marine Conservation Society has provided you with strong written evidence about the impacts of plastic bags in the marine environment and the concerns around the long-term effects of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">microplastics</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in the environment. I am not an expert on that issue, but I think it is an important factor that you need to bear in mind.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Barry Turner:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Can I just add a few points on that? As an industry, clearly, we deplore littering, and we have been working very hard with organisations such as the Marine Conservation Society and others right across the world to tackle littering. Where we have a concern with the policies is that we do not think that imposing a charge on a product will necessarily change behaviour in terms of littering. That is one of our significant concerns. We certainly support any policy that encourages resource minimisation, recycling and reuse. If we thought that this was an instant solution to littering and would have benefits across the range, we might change our position, but we do not think that. The </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Marine Conservation Society</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> would cite that carrier bags make up only 2% of all litter on beaches. The way we look at the littering situation across the world is that, whatever we do in this country, the litter that finds its way into the oceans does not just come from this country, so it has to be tackled uniformly across the globe. That is the approach that our industry is taking and will continue to take.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q34</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Caroline Lucas:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> My immediate response is that it seems a bit perverse to say that, because lots of other countries don’t do it, we are not going to do it. Increasing numbers of countries are doing it, and it is a relatively simple thing to do. Notwithstanding the overall size of the problem, I wonder whether Neil Sinden has any evidence that the policy enables organisations to take people on more of a journey into doing other environmentally beneficial things. It is relatively easy to engage people on this because it is understandable and very present. There is always a debate in the environmental movement on whether small and relatively easy things can begin to get people more aware of bigger environmental problems. Have you done any research, or are you aware of any research?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Neil Sinden:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I’m afraid that we haven’t, and I am not aware of any research in that area, but it is a very important point. We heard from Welsh colleagues earlier that they have picked up signs that the policy is beginning to encourage people to think in different ways. I would like any monitoring of a scheme introduced in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> to look specifically at that question. Anecdotally, we have evidence from public polling suggesting that people respond very positively to the notion of a charge on plastic bags. There is majority public support in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, even now, when a charge has not been introduced.

We have found that there is a difference between the reduction in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Wales</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, which did introduce a charge, and the reduction in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. That is not for want of trying by retailers. You will probably be aware that, wherever you shop, there are plenty of messages and staff are trained to encourage people to reuse carrier bags or use “bags for life”. Reward points are offered for reusing your bags in supermarkets. Lots of incentives are being offered, but it looks as if we have </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">plateaued</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. The figures that we have at the moment show a slight rise, but that may be partly due to the increased population and the increased number of shoppers. That does not change the fact that we have pretty much </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">plateaued</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> after the initial, fairly good reduction. That compares quite starkly with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Wales</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. We have made it clear to the Government that we have made a significant reduction in the number </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">of carrier bags, but it is clear that, if the Government want to see a bigger reduction, a charge, as in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Wales</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, is how you go to the next level. It is not for want of trying. I think most consumers know that they are reminded to try and bring a bag when they visit a supermarket. They are offered reward points.

For us in particular, the specific reference to plastic bags, rather than to bags in general, does not send a consistent signal to consumers around reuse. It was mentioned earlier that one of the important things here is to drive reuse, and I think you do that through behavioural change. Using a bag that might not be plastic but is still single use and could still become litter does not change behaviour. We think that the proposal is confused and does not send the right signal. There is also the exemption from store to store. One consumer could go into one store and be charged for a single-use carrier bag and then go next door and not be charged.

At this point I am afraid we still do not understand the definition because there are all sorts of bags that can degrade in different environments. It is not quite clear what the Government is trying to achieve. It is a bit difficult to comment. It has long been accepted by industry that if you are going to have a biodegradable product in the marketplace then it is designed with a particular use in mind, such as industrial composting. It may be linked to food waste. It is designed with a very specific application in mind. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The possible danger of introducing products, which at this point are unknown because they have not been defined in terms of what type of product could be exempt, into the waste stream is that if it was not properly segregated there would be a danger of cross-contamination. It would potentially affect recycling of plastic film. As I say, there are lots of provisos in that. We don’t know quite what the objective is. We don’t know the definition of the product. I have heard discussion of a new product to a new standard that does not exist at present, so it is very difficult to comment in detail. What I find strange, however, is that this exemption is being proposed without us knowing quite what type of material they have in mind. I would expect that to be known, because it is very difficult to answer and provide evidence when you don’t know really what you are providing evidence on. So there is a risk which cannot be quantified because we don’t know what is being proposed.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Neil Sinden:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The CPRE would echo those concerns apart from the definition problem, which I suspect you will need to look into in more detail. Our fear is that it will do next to nothing to reduce waste, or indeed to reduce littering. There is plenty of evidence to demonstrate that even those bags that are considered to be the most biodegradable at the moment stay in the environment for many years. I think the Marine Conservation Society is also very concerned about the longevity of biodegradable plastic in the marine environment. We know from such bags in landfill that certain bags of that description cannot degrade </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">anaerobically</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. So there are some real challenges. It goes back to the point that the BRC made earlier: we need this system to work well, and in order for it to work well it needs to be simple, to avoid confusing the consumer and to avoid creating problems in terms of the waste recycling challenges that the industry faces. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q48</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Katy Clark:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> One of the concerns that has been raised with us is that if biodegradable bags were used they would have an impact on both the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> plastic and recycling industries, because it would contaminate their products. If we were to go down the path of exemption, how would you define that exemption? What characteristics would you say the bag should have, or is your view that it just should not be exempt at all?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Barry Turner:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> There are two issues. There is the issue of whether it sends a confusing message to the consumer—is it consistent with other waste policies in terms of behaviour that we want to encourage? The other issue is the potential contamination of the recycling stream. Of the products that exist on the market today, the latest study that I am aware of, which has been done in Europe, seems to indicate that at very low levels, with products that exist on the market today, there is a deterioration in the performance of the recycled material. That is where we are today. If nothing else was to change and one of those products was to be adopted and it cross-contaminated the stream, it would definitely affect the recyclers’ products and the performance of those recyclers.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think we have reached the end of our questions, so I thank each and every one of you for coming along this afternoon.

That is not to say that some small businesses that would be exempt could not choose to bring in a charge of their own. They can do that now anyway, but there are issues around, for example, the reporting of the charge and what happens to the money, which the bigger businesses will expect to do, but which we feel would be unfair to put on smaller businesses so that they can participate in the scheme.

We were looking at this issue of proportionality and not wanting to press something on to smaller operators who might wish to participate, but not to treat them in the same way as the bigger retailers. The other issue you are raising there is, I guess, on materials. You mentioned the Welsh example. Another example to look at is the Irish experience, where they have exempted paper bags from the charge and the element of transfer from single-use plastic to single-use paper is very small, so we don’t think that that is a huge problem and a huge risk. Certainly in terms of the large grocery retailers, we do not consider that that is something they will move to, but we will see what we hear back from people on this.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q63</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Whitehead:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Given that the introduction of the charge is essentially about, shall we say, changing behaviour and the change of assumptions—an assumption when you go out to the shops as to what you are going to do—what advice have you sought from any authorities or experts in that area?

We don’t think it will necessarily be that different. We don’t think that the slight differences you have mentioned between our scheme and the Welsh scheme will have a huge effect on the main element to the scheme, which is to drive people towards using bags more than once—reusable bags. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There is another issue around small businesses. Quite often, if people go into a larger business they will have planned that, so they will have those bags with them. We think there is an element that people might just nip into a smaller retailer and want to have a bag available, so there was a slight difference there in how we might treat the smaller businesses—the convenience stores and so on. But that is not to say that those stores cannot impose a charge if they want to; it is just that we wouldn’t impose all the administration of the main scheme on them.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q64</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Whitehead:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> A final thought on that. Given the exemptions that you have proposed, is there possibly going to be a rather ragged and confusing outcome? A number of smaller retailers are saying that actually they do not want to be exempted, and could they please be de-exempted? As you said, they would not be de-exempted, but they could charge if they wanted to. Then the other ones might not and, down the street, somebody might and so on. Do you think that that presents a problem? If so, are there any ways in which that could be resolved?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dan </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rogerson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The large volumes of these bags come from particular types of businesses, and that is where we think the big gain is to be made. As you said, it is absolutely fine for smaller businesses to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">opt in to doing</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> this, so it is really about how the charge and the reporting requirements are handled. That is probably a key difference.

We heard evidence from the British Retail Consortium that one of the key drivers behind that is that the measure is at nil cost to the retailer and may represent a saving to the small business because of not having to purchase lots of plastic bags in the first place. Having seen that, would you reconsider the exemption?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dan </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rogerson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> As I was saying to Dr Whitehead, small businesses are absolutely free to participate and that is a great message: if they want to be part of it, that is really good. But it is this concern about what we are requiring the larger retailers to do with the money that they take in—we do not want to impose that on small businesses. Obviously, if on an optional basis they wanted to account for that and make a donation to a local charity or something, that would be a wonderful thing to do, but, because of our concerns, we are not adding burdens to small businesses. We were very cautious about doing that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What you say about the potential savings to them in not having to buy bags is absolutely true.
