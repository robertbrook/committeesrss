Until the local authority had carried out </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">a lawful assessment under s17 Children Act 1989, as they were required to do, they could not rationally conclude that the family could manage when homeless without any support. Social services refused to change their position. Judicial review proceedings w</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">ere issued. Social services then agreed to accommodate the family pending an assessment. The family’s lawyers withdrew the judicial review since a settlement had been reached.
