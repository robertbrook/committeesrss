The Security Industry Authority is a non-departmental public body that individually licences private security operatives in the United Kingdom that have passed both fit and proper and competency tests. We are responding to these proposals at your invitation because we are one of the organisations in scope. The private security industry is estimated to be worth £6billion to the UK economy and provide to up to half a million in employment. As the regulator we recognise the importance of economic growth and support efforts to encourage it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 6pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 6pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">We would also support efforts to remove impediments to growth, particularly where they do not undermine the performance of current statutory duties. Our view of the growth duty as currently described would be, in principle, no different. This commitment is also a driver in the Government’s consideration of a new regulatory approach which is currently in development and which is based on issuing approvals to businesses. However, because this consideration has not yet concluded, it is difficult for us to provide meaningful responses at this stage to the specific questions posed in this consultation document. We expect to be in a better position to respond more fully when the Government’s plans for a new regime have been finalised. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 6pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 6pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Having said this, we believe proportionate and effective regulation facilitates the most desirable kind of economic growth by preventing non-compliant and, on occasions, criminal, businesses from competing unfairly with compliant ones. At the same time, we wish to highlight that the growth duty should not interfere with specific decisions about individual businesses. We think this is best achieved by considering the duty at an industry level and not at the level of individual regulated entities. We would not want to be faced with a review of a regulatory decision on an individual business or an individual on the grounds that we are restricting growth opportunities. We believe this is something that will be well understood by the Joint Committee and other regulators will make the same point.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 6pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 6pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">In relation to this, and on a more specific note, we would like to highlight our longstanding aim for proportionate sanctions that we can use against non-compliance with our regulations.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">This is why we have sought primary legislation to include civil and administrative penalties as an alternative to criminal prosecution in appropriate cases. Although this is not necessarily for the call for evidence itself, were a clause relating to civil sanctions to be included it would be much simpler for us to regulate in a way which is proportionate and not restrictive of growth. In line with this, having a more targeted range of sanctions would ensure that we are able to take action in the most appropriate way.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 6pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 6pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The final point we would like to make relates to the scope of the draft bill and our status as a regulator for the whole of the United Kingdom, with the responsibilities for our regime fully delegated to the devolved administrations in Scotland and Northern Ireland. We would continue to operate to support the economic growth of the sector across the UK. However, clauses 58 and 59 make it clear that the growth duty relates primarily to England </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">(although Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish ministers can adopt the initiative or aspects of it if they wish). This raises the possibility that the initiative might manifest itself differently (or even not at all) in the devolved </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">administrations, </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">which in turn may have impacts on the industry as a whole, as well as on businesses that trade locally and those which operate nationally.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 6pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 6pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Bill Butler</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 6pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Chief Executive</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 6pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 6pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">September 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 6pt; text-align:right"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt">P</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt">age </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt">2</span></p></div></body></html>
