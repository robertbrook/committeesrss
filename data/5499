SUDG has consistently supported the move to create MCZs and continues to do so. The views of SUDG were made clear in the joint statement that we prepared with the conservation bodies (WCL, MCS, RSPB and the Wildlife Trusts) and presented to Richard Benyon in February 2013. This set out clearly that an essential aspect of good MCZs is a proportionate approach to regulation with clear and practical guidance to meet clear and agreed conservation objectives and management measures. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">This is a critically important time for marine development and the opportunities to support sustainable development and meet Government policies on economic growth, climate change and environmental protection are enormous. SUDG continues to hold the view that well managed MCZs will not prevent economic growth, but if this is to be the case, and to </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">develop the broad statements above, a number of important aspects must be clearly recognised and the management of MCZs must show that these points are properly embraced in determining both designation and subsequent management:</span></p><ol type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.11pt; padding-left:3.89pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Industry is increasing working in collaborative ways to provide data and information about the marine environment and about the impacts of marine activities. We consider it is important that this collaboration is maintained and that there is a need to make sure that the standards of evidence required to identify MCZs are no less rigorous than those that will be required to accompany development proposals. If data is considered sufficient to designate an MCZ, then it must be considered sufficient to act as a baseline for the assessment of marine proposals. This ties in with our position on the current moves to make industry data more widely available and would help ensure that all data is consistent and available for industry development as well as for conservation advice and management. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We noted with interest the recent recommendations made by the Science and Technology Committee following their requirement into marine science</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The marine development sector makes a significant contribution to marine science and evidence in the UK marine area by commissioning a wide range of surveys. While this information is primarily obtained to support the development in question, there can be considerable ‘added-value’ derived from the information that is acquired, both for marine protected areas and to support wider marine management. In most cases this information is able to be made available and many MPAs (including some of the current 27 MCZs) have drawn heavily on the high quality, high resolution data originally acquired by our members. In this respect, we believe that the marine development sector can and already does make a valuable contribution to the evidence base required to support the sustainable development of UK seas; something that rather frustratingly the Committee failed to adequately reflect through either their inquiry or the report that resulted. It should also be stressed that industry has worked closely with your staff on evidence issues arising out of the Habitats Regulations Review, but considerably more remains to be done to ensure consistency of data standards for designation and project appraisal which, by definition, would lead to more collaborative working between regulators and developers for all MPAs.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="2" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.11pt; padding-left:3.89pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Linked to this point, industry has increasing understanding of the impacts of different sector activities and increasing knowledge of the mitigating actions that can be applied to reduce them. To ensure effective regulation once MCZs are designated, it will be important for regulators to take this growing experience into account when determining licences and to work with developers to apply them rather than requiring ever more detailed baseline data. SUDG members are increasingly happy to work with regulators to develop acceptable mitigations which can be applied universally and we feel strongly that post designation (and in the absence of management measures at this stage) that regulators should also put resources and effort in helping to define acceptable mitigations. Effective use of mitigations employed from the outset of a development would be dependent on clear advice from regulators on the conservation objectives and management of a site and an acceptance from them that mitigations can rightly be applied to reduce </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">any impacts. Such an approach would do much to deliver a more proportionate approach to decision making than currently exists.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="3" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.11pt; padding-left:3.89pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">SUDG remains concerned that the consultation in 2013 was made without the benefit of knowing the management measures that will be attached to individual MCZs. At the outset of the process of developing MCZs we were informed that management measures would be part of the information that would accompany any consultation to designate sites and the regional project teams collected a lot of information from stakeholders to help identify measure measures. It was therefore disappointing that were asked to support MCZs when we still did not have a clear understanding of the implications of designation. Given that the next stage of MCZ designation will start in 2015, it is important that the interim period is used to determine more how management measures and conservation advice will be prepared if not for specific sites, then at least in general terms.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="4" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.11pt; padding-left:3.89pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Without clarity on the conservation objectives and associated management measures for the specific features that are being protected, it is also difficult for developers to answer the questions that may be raised by regulators, or indeed for them to plan proactively or adapt their proposals in order to consider and potentially mitigate any significant effects. Without this clarity, the principal benefits to industry of reducing risk and increasing certainty and confidence will not be realised. Consequently there is a need for a clear statement on how these uncertainties should be resolved and managed in a proportionate manner over the immediate, short, medium and long term for each designated MCZ. This would provide a transparent backstop position for both developers and regulators.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="5" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.11pt; padding-left:3.89pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">In addition, we now know that there will be further rounds of consultation to develop management measures of the 27 sites selected in the first tranche, creating a further burden on limited resources within industry to respond to yet more consultation. To ensure that future consultation is meaningful, we would therefore stress that any consultation on management measures must be clear and objective based. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="6" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.11pt; padding-left:3.89pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">In examining the 31 sites proposed for designation, it was clear that, by and large, the sites chosen had less socio-economic impact than others. We were therefore pleased that socio-economic impact was part of the consideration for dismissing the site on the Stour and Orwell. However, we would suggest that, by definition, future tranches will have greater socio-economic impact; consequently, as there is clearly going be to some delay before any further designations, we think it essential that Defra and the MMO put sufficient resources into developing clear and objective methods of socio-economic assessment, so that they are in place and agreed before the next round in 2015. Defra has made it clear that more ecological evidence is required before any future designations can be made and SUDG sees no reason why the same driver should not be applied to socio-economic assessment.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="7" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.11pt; padding-left:3.89pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We also remain unclear how the regulatory decision-making process will consider the environmental impacts of proposed developments alongside the socio-economic impacts that will result. We are aware of the MMO guidance on licensing and the references this makes to the need for socio-economic information, but we are unsure what information will be needed and, more importantly, how it will be assessed and used in decision making. What is already clear from the Impact Assessment that accompanied the consultation, is that the economic consequences assessed for industry were grossly underestimated and cannot possibly represent any meaningful aspect part of the process. Many sectors of society recognised the value of the new legislation in emphasising the need for sustainable development; what is clearly needed now is to ensure that the social and economic components required to consider sustainability are as well developed as those for environment and that this is carried out as a matter of urgency to avoid unnecessary delay to proposals and in ways which are clear and accessible to industry as well as regulators.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="8" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.11pt; padding-left:3.89pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The emerging guidance from the MMO on licensing projects in or near MCZs already makes it clear that the burdens of assessment that will be applied to development will not be significantly different to that which already applies to those sites protected by the Habitats Directive. SUDG has responded comprehensively to the current review of the Habitats Regulations and the points we have made </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">there</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> apply equally to MCZs. In summary, there needs to be a clear balance between the application of the precautionary principle and a risk based approach. This principle linked to the points made above about mitigation and the increasing knowledge we have of possible impacts means that assessment of proposals should start from a baseline of understanding and not require excessive and costly baseline assessments. The increasing knowledge and experience that industry and regulators have should also mean that screening, scoping and assessment work should incorporate this understanding thereby reducing the time and costs associated with assessment and making the process more objective and meaningful. Such an approach should also, as a consequence, be more tuned to the potential scale and impacts of development and should acknowledge these in the determination of scoping and subsequent assessment to ensure greater proportionality.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="9" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.11pt; padding-left:3.89pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The review of the Habitats Regulations referred to in 8 above has led to a number of actions which have the collective aim of ensuring that while environmental protection is paramount, it is also essential that the approaches taken to deliver this by regulators and industry are proportionate. We believe that there will be many opportunities for the benefits of this work to be applied equally to the designation and management of MCZs. We also believe that for this to be successful, the outcome of the work on the review must be clear and applicable particularly in the areas looking at conservation advice and evidence standards for development.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Industry has considerable experience of addressing environmental issues resulting from development and of reaching positive outcomes through constructive discussions that look for win-win solutions.

Industry therefore has a lot to offer, both in terms of the evidence and data required to help define MCZs and in helping to develop effective approaches to marine management, but it is important that that this offer to develop constructive support and assist the process is used more than has been the case to date. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 14pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">9 January 2014</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 14pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 14pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 16pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
