In addition in order to provide a more detailed understanding of transport issues in small island communities we have also attached three documents; 2 related to medical transport (one of which directly reports on issues caused by adverse weather) and the other a broader piece of work comparing the current economic and connectivity situations in the Isles of Scilly and comparing them to other similar island communities, mainly in Scotland (with sections 2.9 inter-island transport, 2.11.1 Sustainable transport strategy findings and 3 links to the mainland of particular relevance). </span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="background-color:#ffffff; font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; line-height:12.45pt; margin:5pt 0pt 7.5pt 28.52pt; padding-left:9.73pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">How do Government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities (including rural and urban areas and island communities)?</span></li><ul type="circle" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="background-color:#ffffff; font-family:'Courier New'; font-size:12pt; line-height:12.45pt; margin:5pt 0pt 7.5pt 66.2pt; padding-left:5.8pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The local authority through its own structures including its Transport Committee and associated transport forum sub groups concentrating on mainland, inter island and St Mary’s (the main island) issues is able to suitably identify demand for passenger transport. The LA is supported in this by the work other groups such as the local Healthwatch service acting as a consumer champion for health and social care and well as other external stakeholders such as the sole provider of transport services to the islands (the Isles of Scilly Steamship Company). On the wider scale the involvement and understanding by Government is minimal due to the scale and geographical isolation, and therefore non generic specific needs and solutions of a small remote island community. This is a shame as finding a resolution for issues of small remote island communities could provide an effective blue print solution for other less remote but still disadvantaged communities.</span></li></ul><li style="background-color:#ffffff; font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; line-height:12.45pt; margin:5pt 0pt 7.5pt 28.52pt; padding-left:9.73pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">To what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?</span></li><ul type="circle" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="background-color:#ffffff; font-family:'Courier New'; font-size:12pt; line-height:12.45pt; margin:5pt 0pt 7.5pt 66.2pt; padding-left:5.8pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The needs of these different groups are largely addressed and taken into account at a local level by private and public providers. This includes inter island water taxi services, local bus and taxi services for the community and a dial a ride service for persons over the age of 60 or with mobility issues. The transition from the on-island local level providers to the national and regional transport providers to enable access and transport to the departure points that enable access to and from the islands is an area for improvement. Eg. There is no specific provision to address needs of less able passengers transferring from bus or train on the mainland to the place of departure to the islands (whether it be the harbour or airport).</span></li><li style="background-color:#ffffff; font-family:'Courier New'; font-size:12pt; line-height:12.45pt; margin:5pt 0pt 7.5pt 66.2pt; padding-left:5.8pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Cost and safe guarding are potential issues for the young in particular with respect of access to further education.

A transport grant of £100 for up to 6 return journeys a year is provided through the Education Funding Agency - an adult return fare from Isles of Scilly to Lands End Airport costs from £140 and there is still the costs of transport to the educational establishment from Lands End Airport.</span></li></ul><li style="background-color:#ffffff; font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; line-height:12.45pt; margin:5pt 0pt 7.5pt 28.52pt; padding-left:9.73pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities?
