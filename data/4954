Sorry you have had to wait a few minutes. It is our first day back and our private business seemed to overrun slightly, but we are very glad to see you again. I think this is pretty well-trodden territory. You will not be surprised by the issues we are going to raise. I would like to start. When the 4th carbon budget was set, expectations about the economy were a bit more optimistic than materialised. The recession has been more protracted and deeper than most people thought three or four years ago. Would it not, therefore, be logical that, if there was to be any change in the 4th carbon budget, it should be to tighten it rather than to loosen it?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Deben</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think the first thing, Mr Chairman, is that we do say in our report that the circumstances are such that, if any change were to be contemplated, tightening would be the most likely alternative to remaining as it is. We made that absolutely clear. Our own view is that the effect of the recession and other things, put together, means that the case for tightening is not sufficiently strong at this moment to overcome the better case for continuity and giving people a continuing understanding of where we are going. There are some things in the future that might make that tightening more necessary, not least if the British Government’s pressure in the European Union were to be wholly successful. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">If what </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Britain</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is seeking to get in terms of the European Union decisions were to come about, then we would have to look again at the way in which we were going to meet that, but it does not seem to us to be sensible to try to prognosticate on that. Where we are brings us at the lower level of what the European Union might be considering and that seems to us to be the safest place to be now, but you are perfectly right. There are a number of pressures, not just that, which would lead one to think that perhaps tightening would be the better form. I </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">think the balance is that continuity, consistency and giving people confidence that we go on as we promised are more important.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Kennedy:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> On cost-effective measures and investments, there was a cost-effective set of measures that we identified when we advised on the 4th budget originally. That is largely unchanged since 2010 when we gave the advice. If you combine that with, as you say, the lower demand projections that are due to the recession then the cost-effective part entails lower emissions than it previously did.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q2 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you think that the very process of review and the discussion about whether the budget should be tighter or looser is going to affect, or is perhaps already affecting, investor confidence? A lot of the investment decisions in industries that are significant emitters are very long-term decisions. We are clearly going to have this debate about the budget review. Is that going to affect investor confidence?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Deben</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The first thing is it is obviously dependent upon the protraction of this consideration of the advice that we have given. It seems to me there is a proper balance in ensuring that we see that the budget, given that it has by its nature to be a long-term one, continues to be based upon the sensible criteria that we have laid down and which the Government has accepted. I am not unhappy about the process of review and, of course, it is written into the Climate Change Act, so it must be admissible. Given the security and strength of the advice that we have been able to give, if the Government is also able to accept our advice that it should be agreed rapidly, I do not think too much harm will have been done. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">On the other side, you have to weigh that off against the public recognition that we do look at these things extremely carefully and in the most detailed way. I think that is helpful, too, because those who are unhappy about the whole system will find reasons for disagreeing with it but at least they can’t say that we have not looked at it extremely carefully. I think that is an extremely important part. There are both sides to that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Kennedy:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> As part of the review, we did consult with a wide range of industry players and there was a very strong message—it was not unanimous, but it was from nearly all of the players—that an early decision to keep the budget at the same level would help to improve their confidence. I think when we gave the advice the CBI has come out and publicly said they think it is probably sensible now to keep the budget at the same level.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q3 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> How quickly would you hope this review process is going to be concluded?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Deben</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Like you, Mr Chairman, having been a Minister, I am always unhappy to press people to do things more quickly than the bureaucratic system works. I would hope that it would be as soon as possible and I think that that must be to the benefit of the Government and industry and indeed to the whole process of combating climate change.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We are about three months away from Easter.

Obviously that is part of the whole discussion and you will see from the document that we have considered that very carefully. We have pointed out that the Government will need to have some additional measures, particularly to deal with the fuel poor who are dependent only on electricity. When we come to discuss these matters we tend and have to take the average, which is, if I am remembering rightly, about 80% of households who are dual-fuel households. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">People who are particularly affected, as you yourself know from your constituencies, are those who depend entirely upon electricity and who have particularly badly insulated homes. Around that area, there is a very specific need for proper Government action. Some of it has happened. Some of it we think needs to be looked at again. Then there is the whole question as to whether the burden of other parts of this should be borne on bills or on general taxation, but that is a matter for the Government.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Kennedy:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It is just important to differentiate as well. There is a set of impacts for affordability and potentially for competitiveness that are related to the Government’s current policies out to 2020. The Government has reviewed those recently and has decided that they are manageable. The incremental impacts associated with the 4th carbon budget are very small, both for affordability and for competitiveness.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q5 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">John Robertson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You said that. If I am right, basically what you are saying is that fuel poverty has nothing to do with climate change. Is that what you are saying? That is how I read your report and that surprises me when there are millions of people in fuel poverty in this country and there will be a lot more by the end of this year.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Deben</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I am sorry if that is how the report can be read, because it is far from what is—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">John Robertson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I will quote, “</span><span style="font-family:MinionPro-Regular; font-size:12pt">For example, incremental affordability and fuel poverty impacts are small.”</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Deben</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: That is a distinction between the impact upon fuel poverty of the additional costs of implementing our climate change policy and the impact of increasing prices that come from the electricity companies themselves. In the one case we are talking about £500 and in the other case we have been talking about less than £100. So you are talking about the distinction between those two. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What we have said about the impact on fuel poverty, of that part of the cost that comes from the battle against climate change, is that the Government does need to have additional policies to deal with that specific element as well as the increases, which have been much bigger, from the electricity companies themselves. It is not a question of ignoring the impact on the fuel poor. We have specifically taken it into account and we have specifically pointed to the issues and we have specifically said that there is not sufficient coverage up to now.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q6 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">John Robertson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Are you saying then that the Government has to protect the energy sensitive industries?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Deben</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We are saying that, too. We have done a full research, which I am sure you have seen, in which we have looked at the money available for those industries and we have concluded that the Government’s promise for compensation, if that is the right word, for the extra costs for energy-intensive industries, is certainly sufficient to cover those extra costs. The problem is that the Government has not yet been able to pay that money because at the moment it is still, in the European Union, being looked at as state aid. It seems to us that it clearly is not state aid. It is a perfectly proper thing to do, but while that is happening these industries are not receiving the money. That is a serious matter and it is a matter that we very much regret.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Kennedy:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We also say that the package that is being offered by the Government at the moment and is being considered in Brussels only goes out to 2016, 2017 and it should be extended beyond that, given that electricity-intensive companies are making the investment decisions that go 10, 20 and 30 years into the future.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Deben</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: That has a specific importance in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, for example, where there are a number of examples where major investments by major companies would be dependent on getting that right.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q7 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">John Robertson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It strikes me as though, in a lot of cases, where the savings in emissions and the investments have been made are all made, shall we say, in the middle to top range of the money chain, the poor are always the ones that are forgotten at the end of the day because there is no financial incentive to do anything there.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Deben</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The truth is that one of the problems we have is that the cost of the energy efficiency measures for the consumer, which are aimed at the poorest in particular, is a real cost and it is a cost that comes on to the bill. There are both sides of that. On the one hand, if you raise the money to do the work then who pays for that? Of course, some of that is being paid by the poorest consumers and that is why we pointed to the need for special additional measures as far as the very poor are concerned. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The other thing is that we have been looking at and will do in greater detail in our deep dive report, which will be published in July—under the Climate Change Act we are bound to do that, which is the four-yearly report—is the cost effectiveness of some of the measures. For example, I have already trailed the fact that there are some real questions about whether the use of money to deal with insulation of solid walls is the most sensible way to use that money.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">John Robertson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> That is a big problem in my area and the problem, of course, always is that if it is not financially worthwhile and you are not going to get anything out of it then nothing gets done.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Deben</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: That is absolutely true.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q8 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">John Robertson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Again, the ones down at the bottom end of the money food chain have a real problem. Could I finish by just asking, what are the potential wider benefits of maintaining the 4th carbon budget at its current level?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Deben</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The first thing is just to remind you that the cost of the 4th carbon budget is relatively small. We are talking about something in the area of £20 extra on to the bills. That is, roughly speaking, what it is. The discussions that we have been having are about costs that predate the 4th carbon budget. The second thing is that the wider benefits are, first of all, that industry, the consumer and the Government knows exactly where it is. There is continuity for investment, which is what we want. Secondly, it makes sure that we are on track to meet our statutory obligations to reduce our emissions by 80% by 2050, our obligations under the European Union’s present agreements and indeed those that we are seeking to extend and our obligations under the United Nations agreements.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We are on track for that and we are on track for it in the most cost-effective manner. That, of course, is a big issue and that is one of the things we have to try to do because, however difficult the issues may be about fuel poverty and the like, the one thing we do have if we are going to solve those is to make sure that we are doing this in the most cost-effective way. One of the things we did was to look at what would happen if you did not do it in this way but you backfill, so to speak; you did it much later. The results of our work there suggest that under almost any conceivable scenario it would be very much more expensive. I think those are all benefits that come from keeping to the present trajectory.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q9 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">John Robertson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> While I accept what you are saying, there is still the problem of the moral obligation. Do you look at the moral side of not doing anything for the fuel poverty area?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Deben</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I do not know how I can be clearer to you that fuel poverty is a central issue for the Climate Change Committee, but it is personally a central issue too. Although I used to represent for many years a constituency that was seen as a relatively comfortable constituency, like so many rural areas I had some very poor people and areas.

If the Government decides, because of the particular case that you mention and it is a very real one, that it wanted to go down a more expensive route then that is a proper decision for the Government, but it is a decision it must make.

We have a responsibility to take full account of fuel poverty. That is not the simple choice that we would make, but what we have to do is to point to the Government—we are in this area absolutely the advisers of the Government—what the result is of particular decisions. First of all, what do you have to do in total to reduce the emissions? Then to say to them, “If you do these things, these things will arise. If you do those things, other things will arise”. It is then for the Government to make that judgment. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I can have a personal view. One of the things I try to do, and it is quite hard to do it sometimes, is to stop what I would call mission creep. It is not part of the Climate Change Committee’s remit to tell the Government that it should make that social decision as against that social decision.

Clearly a big chunk of the various components of achieving that budget would be taken up by that target. Last year there were 16,000 solid wall insulations achieved in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, which means that the target would be reached in, what, 212 years’ time. Is that a matter of fundamentally blowing apart the statistical makeup of what the budget might look like in terms of its components or is that, as you say, something that is a palette of different options that may be pursued?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Deben</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is a palette of many options and up to now there have been decisions made by DECC as to how the money should be spent and what are the proper areas for it to be and, again, I come back to it. Overall, we see that the budget can, with reasonable comfort, be met. How you meet it is obviously flexible and it is important for us to point to the Government that it can meet it in some ways that have socially-valuable additions, in which case it will cost them more, or it can meet it in other ways without those socially-valuable additions, which will still deliver the budget. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I still come back to the creep issue. I do not want to get into areas that the Climate Change Committee should not; although you will know, from my own views on these matters, it is very difficult to keep out of them because I do have a very strong view that there is an important social issue here. Just as the poorest suffer most from climate change and the poorest countries are least able to handle climate change, which is one of the reasons we have a particular model of responsibility here, so it is true in our community that the poorest are going suffer most from climate change because they do not have the ability. At the present time the poor suffer from all sorts of things and we ought to have a policy that manifestly has, in the words of David Sheppard, a bias to the poor.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Kennedy:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We were asked the specific question, “Given where we are with a low level of solid wall insulation at the moment, could you, over a 15-year period, grow that industry?” The answer is it is feasible. Yes, you could do that. You could get to several million insulations by 2030. Would you want to do that? Is it desirable? We have said that is an open question and we will come back on that one in the summer. There is the flexibility, as John says, within the budget to meet it in different ways with lower or higher levels of solid wall insulation or other measures such as heat pumps and whatever.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Whitehead:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Some level of solid wall insulation, one might think.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Deben</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Kennedy:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You would want some level.

The Act is very clear as to what we should do and that is to take the factors upon which the original budget was based and then assess whether those factors have changed sufficiently to demand a tightening or a loosening of the budget. That is precisely what we did and we did not do anything else because that is our statutory duty. Were we to confuse it in any other way, it seems to me that that would be not the way that you behave. We have put very clearly what the Act says you should do. That very much helps the point that the Chairman made about whether this process undermines investment confidence. It might undermine it if I had introduced all sorts of factors that were not part of that and not part of the Act, so I think trying to keep to that is necessary.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Kennedy:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> There are 10 criteria in the Act upon which we gave our original advice. Just to collapse those into something that is generally intelligible, we advised on a budget that is the cost-effective path to meeting the 2050 target subject to the impacts of being on that path being manageable. The question for the review is: has anything changed? Has there been a significant change that either the cost-effective path is different or the impacts associated with being on that path—affordability, competitiveness and the other factors—has anything happened to make those now prohibitive in a way that they were not previously?

One is always asking those questions and I think that Dr Kennedy would accept that he very often gets a note in the morning saying, “So and so said this.

Again, the conclusion of the IPCC, looking at all of the evidence, is that the only reasonable explanation of what we have seen over the last 100 years or so is that it is human-induced temperature increase. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Now, there are alternative theories.

I just wanted to make a point about how one has to proceed in this world. It is always possible, with any argument, to suggest that there might be another explanation of which we have not thought. You have to say, “Well, if there is one we have to look at it”. Then it is possible to say, “Well, we have this explanation that we think is a better one than the one that you are using”. You do have to consider that and you have to consider it very carefully. All I can say, Mr Stringer, is that we have come to the conclusion, using the best evidence that we have, that no other explanation begins to be anything—I was going to say “likely”, but I think it is nearer to certain in that sense—likely to be as certain as the concept that human intervention of the kind we have been talking about is causing and will continue to cause this effect on the climate. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That does not mean to say that, were there to be other proposals, other ideas, things that we do not know about, we would not be looking at them, but human beings have to proceed on the best evidence that they have. There is no other way of doing it. If we do not proceed on the best evidence we have, we are going to proceed on less good evidence and maybe the worst evidence that we have. I know your position and it is one I respect and we have had discussions on other committees in that way and I think you would agree that we more or less come to much the same logical approach. I just want you to know that at no time do we fail to look at any suggestion and that is because I wish climate change was not happening because I do think that it is a very significant challenge to us. Therefore, frankly, if I could find an easier answer I would want it.

This is an extraordinarily complicated area of science. A lot of people involved are not scientists. The vast majority of people are not climate scientists. The crutch that people go back on then is there is a consensus. Do you accept the criticism there has been of the major paper that gives the 97% consensus of Doran, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Anderegg</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and Cook that somebody like me, who is probably more sceptical than you are about this issue, would be included as a supporter of the consensus, whereas I am not? Many major scientists have complained that, in the review of their papers, they have been included in that consensus and there are other papers that say that within </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">climate science itself it is about 50/50.

I do not think that I take the “consensus” word as referring to the 97%, that particular paper. What I take it from is the undoubted fact that overall those who are concerned in this field have clearly come to a view, which is that the climate is changing significantly and that that change is the effect of human activity or at least the effect of human activity is a major part of that. I am not doing it on the basis of adding up and saying, “That one and that one”, and that does not seem to be the right way to do it. I think you have to look at the proof. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Even if you take the 50/50 argument, of course what you have to look at is what bits of those papers are applicable in these circumstances. I think that gets you much closer to the original paper than the 50/50 argument but, again, the big issue is to say, “What is the most likely explanation? What do the people who are most involved in this and who have looked at this most closely think? What, indeed, in your mind do you think of the evidence?” You have to come to that and I certainly believe that to say that there is scientific consensus in this area is true; just as to say, as I understand it, that every applicable learned society would take that view. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I think that, in the circumstances, this is the view that one should properly take, without ever </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">resiling</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> from the fact that there could be new evidence. If you are a scientist or if you are trying to deal with science, you always have to say what you are saying is the evidence you have at the moment and if something else happens tomorrow then you have to revise. It is not a theology. It is not religion. It is not saying, “That is what has been said and, therefore, it will always be true”. It is in fact science. Therefore, all I can say is that, from all that I read and all that I work at, the consensus is very clear, but tomorrow someone may produce something that would suggest we should think about it again and, if we do, we will think about it very quickly.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q25 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Dr Kelly mentioned that it is possible to explain, as indeed it is possible to explain, the pause in any statistically significant warming over the last 15 years by natural variations.

You can’t rule that out, but would you base policy on everything we have seen is natural variation and we shouldn’t worry about the future and putting a load of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and we would not expect to see a significant temperature increase?

You would expect over the longer term for natural variations to have different effects at different times and you would take that into account. Yes, that is perfectly true. There is a sort of mechanistic concept that you have a lot of natural variations here that have one effect and then that is countered by a lot of natural variations here that have a different effect. I do not think that is the way you have to look at it. You are trying all the time to see what effect natural variations at any particular time have and also the effect of man-made changes that come from emissions and you have to do that on a sensible basis.

I would like your comments on that and ask whether it is consistent, having assumed they are wrong for the next 20 years that they are running too hot, why rely on the models for the remainder of the century?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Deben</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The first principle I have is that one should take, if I may dare use the word, the most conservative view about these matters into account. Therefore, I think it is absolutely right, if people feel that this may be so, that should be taken into account. There are other areas where evidence suggests that this may be a significant underestimate and we have seen lots of discussions since then that have led to that view. One has to accept that this is the best evidence that we have, that there is quite a lot of evidence that this is underestimating what the effect is and—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Sorry, which is: the models or the experts?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Deben</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The reduction may be at the conservative end of it, if I am using it in that sense, but I am sticking to that and that seems to be sensible.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The reduction may be at the conservative end?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Kennedy:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Let’s be clear. We have not relied on climate models to come to our conclusions. We have looked at three lines of evidence. We have looked at energy balance models, we have looked at the historical record and we have looked at climate models; those three. That is what gives you the range of uncertainty for climate sensitivity. I have said that we modelled and it is very clear, if you read the reports, that we have looked across the range of estimates of climate sensitivity from all three lines of evidence. We have not said climate models are superior to energy balance models, for example, or vice versa. We have said we need to look at all of those and consider, across the range of uncertainty and across the range of risk, what the appropriate response is.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q28 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I am merely quoting what the IPCC is doing.

The point is, as David has said and I was going on to say, that we have taken different routes to look at this and we have come to our conclusions not by putting dittos under the IPCC’s report but saying, “Looking at this and looking at these other things, we have come to this conclusion”. That is our job.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Kennedy:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> If all we relied on was the climate models, at the 80 percentile you would have to say it probably is not stringent enough and we should be doing more—if that was all we relied on—but because we do not rely on the climate models, because we look at all of the different lines of evidence, we have said, “It is okay to keep with the 80% for now, but let us </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">watch very carefully what happens in this area”. That is important as well. We always continue to look at the scientific evidence.

You can say, “Well, what is the expected temperature increase if we assume”, to use the jargon, “a climate sensitivity of 1.5, which is the very low end of the range, in the IPCC report? If that was the case, what is the temperature change you would expect to see in 2100 based on assumptions about emissions over time?” That is something that you can do. The way that the climate models work, if you do not put that number in at the low end of the range, they tend to use a higher number; so they get a higher temperature increase. We have said, “Well, let’s take the numbers out of the climate models. Let’s put the lower numbers that people have suggested into a model and see what happened then”. That is what our recommendations are based on.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q29 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Good. I just return to the point that my colleague Graham Stringer made earlier. Although I would not expect anything that has happened to remove your confidence or indeed my own confidence that the underlying greenhouse effect will continue, given the fact there has been a pause and the fact that recent studies have tended to come out with these lower climate sensitivities you have mentioned, wouldn’t that make you think that on the whole it was a bit less alarming than previously it had been?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Deben</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I don’t think that is the result of what you said and it certainly is not the result if it is taken in the context of other evidence that has a different view. I think the moderate position that we take is the right one and that is that there is sufficient evidence to lead us to believe that any sensible, responsible person should seek to ensure that we do not increase the emissions but indeed reduce them very significantly as a matter, at least, of insurance and probably of absolute necessity. That seems to me to be unchanged and I am more confident in that today than I was a year ago and I wish I was not.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q30 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Earlier you asked me whether you had ever cast doubt on the motivation of climate scientists and I now remember that you did precisely that at the conference that we both spoke at in Cambridge at Fisher House where you advised everybody to read the book called </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">The Deniers</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and they would see the real motivation of these people.

It seems to us—or it seems to me—that if we were able to produce that gas from our own resources there are significant advantages to that, because you do not increase the emissions. If you are going to use some gas, it is better to use your own gas. That is the first thing. Secondly, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">fracking</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> of course is not just a question of the production of gas for energy purposes. We do not know yet, because we have not done it sufficiently to know what the composition of the gas is in each place, but </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">fracking</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> could easily produce the fractions that are necessary for using gas as a feedstock. If that was so, then you would not be talking about the same thing at all. You would be talking about a very valuable resource being used in the best possible way.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I think most of us would prefer fossil fuels, which are of their nature finite, to be used in the best way, and as a feedstock that would be very valuable. My view is that we should proceed to see what </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">fracking</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> can take place, what it produces. It can play a proper part. There are three things perhaps to be careful about. One is not to invest in an infrastructure that means that you find yourself in the circumstances in which you have to use gas when there were better alternatives, because you have spent so much money on the infrastructure. That is an issue you have to take seriously.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The other two issues to take seriously are either end of the spectrum.

I do not see the argument. You do have to have proper environmental controls, but that is a different issue. I also think those at the other end, who suggest that this is a sort of wonderful save-all for everybody have not looked either at the scientific facts and the likelihoods or indeed of the real difficulties and the differences between this country and the United States.

I said it was not planning to reduce emissions, it was planning to reduce the intensity of its emissions and you said that that was the position but it has changed and, over the last three months, there is subsequent evidence of that.

I have no interest, so to speak, but I am just trying to give you the best knowledge that I can, and all that I can say is that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">within the Chinese Government at the moment, the discussion that is going on is not about carbon intensity issues. The discussion is about when peaking will happen. That is what the discussion is about.

I was trying to explain to the Committee that our evidence from </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">China</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is that the Government understands that peaking is certainly possible and obtainable. They are discussing as to when that might be. They have not announced a date or indeed an intention, but my job is to try to tell you all that I know, and all that I know is that that is what the discussion is about. It is not about not doing this, it is about doing this. Therefore, that is evidence, that is something that has happened since the Committee made its excellent report, and that is all I was trying to do, and put that in the context. We shall see whether a change takes place and we shall see whether they go further than I have suggested or less far, but I can only give you the evidence that I have.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q45 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Moving on from that rather unsatisfactory exchange, in your document on the 4th, you say, “Our analysis suggests that the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> targets imply reductions in carbon intensity to 2020 comparable to other countries, including </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">China</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">” so we are being as rigorous as </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">China</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, rather than them doing something very dramatic, it would appear.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Deben</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: In the particular period of time, that is correct, but I can hold that perfectly rationally by saying that at the same time what they are intending to do appears to be significantly greater in a very much more difficult circumstance, which of course is true in a country that is developing in the way that China is.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q46 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Though your report also says, “Per capita emissions in China are now comparable with the UK and EU average” so they are comparable now, they are going to increase substantially and account for half the increase in emissions worldwide, yet they are certainly going to use a lot more per capita than us and yet we are taking as stringent action as them to reduce our emissions.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Deben</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I do think one has to take seriously the difference in the situation. Here is a country that is making its development and paying for its huge social problems largely by doing there what we do not do here any longer. That is what they are doing and therefore a very large number of their emissions are the result of what we in the West are demanding. That is part of life. Here is a country trying to come to terms with this, and I am merely saying to you, Mr Lilley, that this is a country that has not caused climate change up to now. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In this part of the world, we have. We have a past responsibility and model of responsibility of some importance. That is not theirs; they have not done that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Our job is to create a world in which it is possible for them to develop without endangering the planet, so what I am looking at is what is this country doing, which is on a trajectory like this? First of all, it says, “We are going to reduce the carbon intensity”. This is very parallel with what major companies have done. They have said, first of all, “We will reduce the carbon intensity of our production”. It is the first thing they say, and then they are pressed to say, “That still means if you are going to produce more bottles or more packages, then you are going to increase the amount of carbon you use” and they say gradually, “We have to come to a situation in which we do not increase the amount of carbon, even though we are increasing our business”. That is what China is talking about now in a very serious and specific way in the Government as to how they move from the present situation, which you perfectly rightly identify, in which they have been—and I agree with you, not only for climate change reasons, but for pollution reasons—tightening on a regular basis, that how they move from that to a point at which they peak, the information that is important is that peaking is possible within the 2020s and that they are discussing where that might be. It is likely that they will make political decisions on that basis, but they will be as political as anyone else as to when they announce it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q47 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> One final point, if I may, from your very helpful report. You said they are now thinking of planning to reduce their carbon intensity, indeed by 40% to 45% by 2020, compared to 2005 levels. You also say that since 1990, Chinese emissions have grown by 290% and GDP by 699%. That implies that they reduced intensity by 58% over 20 years, for example, at roughly the same rate as they are intending to continue reducing intensity over the next 15 years.

What we have said is the levy control framework should measure subsidy for technology development. It is a subsidy that is there for a good reason, but what you want to measure is subsidy. The way that the power system works and the wholesale market works is the more low-carbon technologies you have on the system, then the wholesale price is not a relevant benchmark for comparing how much subsidy do we need to give over and above that wholesale price. As you invest in low-carbon technologies, because of the nature of those technologies, they have low short-run marginal cost, you depress wholesale prices in the market, and that would tell you that you are giving massive subsidies for low-carbon technologies, which is not the case. Instead, we have said, “What you should do is compare the cost of the low-carbon technologies with the cost of the alternative that you would invest in” which is gas-fired generation, and if you do that, then the low-carbon technology additional costs become very small. It is the only sensible way to think about a levy control framework in the 2020s.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q66 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dan </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Byles</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So in the benchmarking for the 2020s you used the cost of a new CCGT?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Kennedy:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes, which are the two things you compare.
