However, whilst this illustrates the key information that Ofsted hopes to emphasise for 2012/13, NAHT would stress that the number of framework and guidance changes employed by Ofsted, makes any meaningful year on year comparison of the work of Ofsted all but impossible. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="3" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.17pt; padding-left:3.83pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Two key pieces of information are however indisputable. The first is that </span><span style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">England</span><span style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">’s schools are improving. Despite the public rhetoric from the Chief Inspector, schools are increasingly found to be good or better by Ofsted – despite the ever changing demands of a chaotic inspection system. We are pleased that HMCI has chosen to recognise this fact in his report, but would fiercely contest the suggestion that these improvements have been driven by the inspection system. If anything, we believe the constant interference by a highly inconsistent workforce has hindered school improvement by stifling innovation and weakening school leadership. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="4" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.17pt; padding-left:3.83pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The rep</span><span style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">ort states that:</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 72pt"><span style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">In a study of 42 schools carried out after the first three months of monitoring inspections, inspectors found that three quarters had made one or more changes to staffing, the majority to the school leadership, following the judgement of requires improvement. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="5" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.17pt; padding-left:3.83pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">School leaders losing their jobs on the basis of one school inspection finding should be a matter of concern rather than celebration, especially considering the extreme variation in the reliability of inspection judgements. Let us not forget that ‘Requires Improvement’ is not a ‘category’ and these schools are not eligible for intervention. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="6" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.17pt; padding-left:3.83pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Some of this is undoubtedly being driven by the new local area inspections. In our experience these are promoting a scapegoat culture, rather than a climate for school improvement. With depleted resources, many local authorities are already struggling to provide meaningful school improvement services. Fearful of this resulting in a poor area inspection result many are hoping to look tough on school performance by taking knee-jerk responses to school inspection outcomes and dismissing school leaders rather than providing them with support to improve their school.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="7" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.17pt; padding-left:3.83pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">It is hardly surprising then that the second indisputable piece of information is that dissatisfaction with Ofsted is increasing. According to the Ofsted annual report and accounts published in June 2013, the proportion of inspections resulting in a first level complaint has increased compared to the previous year, as has the proportion of complaints going to second stage; the number </span><span style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">of complainants going to independent adjudication has almost doubled in twelve months.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="8" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.17pt; padding-left:3.83pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">It continues to be the case that only half of school inspectors have recent school leadership experience. Whilst an improvement, this is still woefully low. In our experience, early years settings, primary and special schools continue to be poorly served by the inspection workforce with very few receiving an inspection from teams with backgrounds in these areas. It is therefore unsurprising that the highest number of complaints to Ofsted came from those in early years settings, closely followed by those from primary schools.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="9" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.17pt; padding-left:3.83pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The inconsistency and poor performance of inspectors is well known to the Chief Inspector himself, causing him to write to them requesting their cooperation stating ‘I still see inspection reports, occasionally from HMI, which ignore [HMCI guidance] and irritatingly, give the impression that we are still telling teachers how to teach [...] Please, please, please think carefully before criticising a lesson because it doesn’t conform to a particular view of how children should be taught.’ (letter 21</span><span style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:7.33pt; vertical-align:super">st</span><span style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> Jan 2014)</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="10" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="color:#011138; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Following the distribution of this message from HMCI, NAHT have received examples of Ofsted rewriting published reports to bring them into line with HMCI. Such retrospective tampering with public records is questionable at best. We would suggest that this is an area the Select Committee may wish to explore further with Sir Michael.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">January 2014</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
