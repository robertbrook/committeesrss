There is no single cause for the development of DR-TB, but key factors include the incorrect or inconsistent application of TB drugs, lack of availability of the necessary TB drugs, and the challenge of ensuring patients successfully adhere to treatment. The consequence of the above are low global completion rates, with the Eastern European region – which contains 25% of the world’s DR-TB cases – achieving treatment completion rates of less than 50%.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="2" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 31.25pt; padding-left:4.75pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The key to reducing the development of DR-TB is correct treatment of drug sensitive TB, so projects and programmes that expand the care and control of TB in any format will help to reduce the spread of DR-TB.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-variant:small-caps">Q3: Is there sufficient research and investment into new antibiotics or other treatments and methods to ensure continued protection against infection?

The Medical Research Council (MRC) funds basic TB research, trials and implementation at a level of around £12m a year.

The UK supports many, but not all, of the global responses to the disease, including the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria and UNITAID, which are respectively responsible for the majority of TB care and control programmes, and the roll-out of new technologies such as new drugs.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="9" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.25pt; padding-left:4.75pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Given that the UK has the highest rates of TB in Western Europe, however, it could be doing more to contribute towards cross-border initiatives. It should work more closely with EU colleagues to heighten the response to the drug-resistance crisis within the European region and to acknowledge the threat that DR-TB poses to countries across Europe. This will require close collaboration within EU structures and an effort to ensure that Middle-Income Countries are eligible for the critical support they need to combat the disease (this is the same for the Global Fund, see above)</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="10" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The UK should also support TB REACH, a Stop TB Partnership initiative that has been influential in rolling out new diagnostic services such as Gene XPert that quickly and efficiently diagnose drug-resistant TB and, therefore, ensure that patients receive the correct treatment for the nature of their disease, rather than being treated with drugs to which they are already resistant. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="11" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">As a strong historic donor to some of the worst affected countries (notably India and South Africa) the UK should look to encourage greater investment of domestic resources into the care and control of TB.
