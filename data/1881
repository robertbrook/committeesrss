Anyone can access any type of pornography including, violence, r</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">ape, acted child pornography, s and </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">m, extreme degradation of women and more. There</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> is no log in page and no age check. This is unacceptable. This is not tolerated in pubs or strip clubs so why is</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> it freely available online? A simple</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> answer is to make online pornography sites operate account only </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">sites,</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> the use must provide their details</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> and have a user name. This will reduce the amount of times people stumble upon online porn without affecting the freedom of choice for users of online porn.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Secondly, internet filters are great for parents and I am in favour of the automatic filter. It ma</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">kes sense that those who wish to view pornography should be the ones making the choice rather that everyone getting it and then having to choose not to have access. However, there are serious concerns.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">I have Talk Talk Homesafe settings which are good in t</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">heory. They allow the user to turn on and off filters. In practice this rarely works. I need to turn filters off to read material for my work but usually when I want to turn it back on, it freezes or takes hours. Secondly, some sites are blocked which do n</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">ot contain pornography such as rape support sites. Similarly, even with my homesafe settings on </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">I</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> could still type in sex or porn and get some extreme sexual images through google images. It is crucial that this is monitored and dealt with swiftly.</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> Clearly</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> the technology is already there, it just needs monitoring.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Next issue is advertising. Many sites have pop ups which can lead to sexual material. I have seen instances of this on school approved websites and on kindle children’s books (Alice in Wonderland </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">was one)</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">. Advertising that is aimed at adults should never appear on sites that are aimed at children. This should be a criminal offence as it is grooming.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Online safety is something parents need to understand to take seriously. With channels such as Cebeb</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">ies encouraging very young children to go online and the rise of little children having tablets, education of parents is </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">key</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">. My suggestion is that this is discussed by Health Visitors in the early </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">years</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> checks. It should be a face to face discussion of th</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">e dangers and a leaflet given of how to keep up. Every device that is sold must have an easy to understand guide for parents to set blocks and this should be discussed at purchase. This needs to be regulated so that it happens every time. It is not like th</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">e days when parents had to make sure toddlers didn’t choke on a piece of </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">lego,</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> parents do not understand the technology that their kids do. The digital age has approached so quickly. Following this, schools should offer compulsory help for parents to under</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">stand keeping children safe online. The world has moved on and parenting needs to catch up. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">This is an issue which the government needs to support parents to protect children. The starting point is to regulate the porn industry (like we do with tobacco, a</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">lcohol and gambling industries). It is unbelievable that the porn industry is given such a free reign to provide such an unrealistic and harmful portrayal of what is actually a wonderful act that humans should enjoy.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">September 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
