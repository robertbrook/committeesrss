I wish everybody a happy new year.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We have quite a few questions to get through, a large panel and virtually a full turn-out of Committee members on this most important issue, so it would be really helpful if people who wish to catch my eye, including panellists, just make themselves known to me. I will do my best to keep everybody succinct and bring everybody in. We are not looking for long answers, but for direct answers.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Given that the Government has made the announcement it has made, I should like to start by gauging whether any of you had had discussions with Government about the proposed exemption for biodegradable bags, and if so, briefly, what form that took. Who wants to start?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jessica Baker:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We have attended—well, I have, and colleagues in the reprocessing sector—the round table event about the search for a biodegradable bag. This was a week prior to the announcement, so at that point we felt it was a general discussion. We raised our concerns, but obviously we were quite surprised that, a week later, the carrier bag tax was announced and also the exemption for biodegradable was announced. I think we found that quite intriguing, because obviously Defra had given us the impression that it was the start of the debate, whereas, obviously, we felt then that, actually, decisions had probably already been taken. Although we did try and engage, up to that point we felt that we had been ignored.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Other than that, we have responded to the Defra consultation and also to your Committee’s consultation.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mike Baxter:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Chairman, good afternoon.

We do not make them. We do not sell them. Similarly, we have no interest in the manufacture or sale of additives—biodegradable or stabilising additives.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In answer to your question, we have, since this announcement was made, as some Committee members will know, spent a great deal of time and effort lobbying and making our position clear about the damage we believe that the proposal to include biodegradable exemptions would cause to the UK recycling sector. I make that point because we do not have any axe to grind. We do not make or sell carrier bags. We do not make additives. We are recyclers. That is why we feel so passionately about this, with our thousands of employees whose positions could be threatened with this.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q88</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> My question really was trying to get from you what advance notice or engagement you had with Government in terms of the proposals which were subsequently brought forward.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mike Baxter:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The proposal for a carrier bag tax, if you will excuse the expression, has been—we have been involved with it for 10 or 15 years, and our position has been broadly neutral.

I, too, was rather surprised at how quickly the policy came out after the round table. The gist of our submission to the Government is this: the ideal policy should be one that reduces the number of bags in circulation; it should raise money for good causes without imposing a significant burden on the poorest households; and for the bags that remain after the reduction it should encourage retailers to supply the ideal bag. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The Minister, when he came before the Committee on the 18</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">th</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, referred to that when he said that the policy should be that the bags that are used after the reduction “</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">are better by being biodegradable, rather than</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> simply single-use…bags”. We said to him that the ideal bag should be fit for purpose for the lifetime specified by the Government. It should be reusable for shopping and other purposes and made partly from recycled plastic. It should be recyclable if collected during its lifetime without the need for separate collection and, if not collected, it should safely biodegrade in the open environment. We said that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">it needs to be an </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">oxo</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> bag, not a bio-based bag, so</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> it will not generate methane in landfill and will cost little or no more than the ordinary plastic bag. That was the gist of our submission to them.

I think industry is at the heart of the solution, but we need to be clear about what we are aspiring towards. How quickly do we want a plastic carrier bag to degrade in the natural environment in which we might find it? Is it acceptable to have it littering the streets for 18 months or two years, or does it need to go in four weeks? It needs to be clear to industry what the challenge is. If we are expecting industry to innovate, it needs to be clear what an acceptable situation would be from a public perspective concerning bags littering the environment. The concern I have is that you will simply switch use from one type of disposable to another, but there will not be the associated reduction in waste in the environment. It is quite a tall order that you are expecting. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jessica Baker:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I agree entirely. It is almost impossible to achieve what the Government are looking for. If we actually get a bag that degrades as they are requiring—i.e. very quickly and in all environments, open and closed—ipso facto it will not be </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">reprocessable</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> with normal waste stream, hence you will put all the reprocessing jobs at risk. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q92</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Caroline Lucas:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Isn’t the Government exemption that is being sought strange? In answer to an earlier question, Professor Thompson, you rather tantalisingly said that you hadn’t completely got to the bottom of why the Government might be proposing such an exemption. I wonder whether I can tempt you to say a little more about the bit that you have got to the bottom of. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Thompson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I agree wholeheartedly that it is important to embrace industry in the solutions for innovation. Industrial innovation lies absolutely at the heart of the solutions to managing the problems we have got—with the use of fossil oil, through single-use plastic items, into waste. Around 30% of our possible oil reserves are going in that single-use manner. Within about a year they are being disposed of, and they are ending up in the waste stream or as litter. Industry is at the heart of that, and plastic bags are part of the waste problem, albeit quite a small part. It is important that industry is involved, but industry can play a much bigger role in innovation on some of the other materials that are contributing to waste than they can on plastic bags. The answer clearly lies in material reduction and a movement towards reusable material. If you reduce the amount that is being used, you reduce the reliance on fossil reserves and you reduce the amount of waste, but you also ensure that bags are recyclable when they come to the end of their life, which makes them a renewable source.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q93</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Caroline Lucas:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> That all makes sense, but the question was on the rationale for seeking the exemption.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Thompson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I can only assume that it is about embracing industry in resolving the problem, but I am concerned.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q94</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> That doesn’t quite answer Caroline Lucas’s question on the Government’s motives.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Thompson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I cannot speak for them.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Michael Stephen:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It is what the Minister said on 18 December.

It is possible that, after many years, the plastic bag tax is now inevitable, yet somehow maybe the Government feel that they still do not want to make the British public pay for their carrier bag, so they are looking for an exemption solution. We in the processing sector would argue for an entirely environmental exemption. If you have to have a bag, the choice should be for a reprocessed plastic bag with a majority of recycled materials.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">David Newman:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It could be that the Government have seen what has happened elsewhere.

Has there been sufficient connectivity with the BIS Department on the cross-cutting aspects of this?

There are not any supermarket carrier bags manufactured in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United Kingdom</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.

All of the plant and equipment that used to employ—and I know, because my business had to make more than 1,000 people redundant in the late 1990s, when all supermarket carrier bag manufacturing transferred to the Pacific rim, where it is today.

What are the consequences likely to be? I ask because I picked up that Professor Thompson essentially said that the message that the exemption of biodegradable bags gives is that littering is okay as long as products are biodegradable. Given that in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> that exemption does not exist, do you have a view on that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Thompson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> May I start? I don’t feel that there should be any exemptions. I feel that what we are trying to achieve here is a reduction in the usage of single-use bags, be they conventional plastic, degradable plastic or paper. That is what we are trying to achieve. And if I look at the drivers that come from Defra, from other documentation within the UK and from Europe, they are about reducing the use of single-use bags, about material reduction, whether that is oil and gas or cutting down trees to make paper bags, and the associated waste generation, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">to reduce littering in the environment, and—if we can do so all at the same time—to reduce carbon emissions. So, those seem to be the drivers and any exemption that we consider has to address all, or a good number, of those drivers; otherwise, we are in serious danger that we will move from one disposable item that has those problems to another disposable item that has a range of related or possibly different problems. So the exemption must be considered in relation to the levy. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mike Baxter:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Again, we don’t make carrier bags, paper or polythene, so perhaps I can give you some neutral figures here.

Now, the Government are not—I think—thinking that they can reverse history and get all the manufacture of plastic bags back from China and into the United Kingdom, because such bags are a low-cost product and do not require the sophisticated technology that we have in this country.

That is why the perfect plastic bag for us in our country is a compostable plastic bag, because we can then use that to collect our organic waste in our households and send it to composting and to anaerobic digestion, therefore decontaminating the organic waste stream. That is the answer from the experience we come from. That is a strategic vision of the whole waste system that we have in our country, rather than a vision of whether it should be 5p or 10p.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q105</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Whitehead:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> If a compostable bag got into the collection of general plastics, would that mean that the recycling hierarchy would collapse?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Michael Stephen:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">David Newman:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Have you not asked yourself what happens to the contrary?

We are looking to reduce the diversity of materials and we are discussing that in line with the recyclers to ensure that we are coming up with a nirvana bag that has the maximum potential to be used over and over again and to be recycled into new material as effectively as possible, when it comes to the end of its life.

Then the second strategic issue was: “How do we connect reducing plastic bags with improving the efficiency of our organic waste collection schemes?” because they were growing very rapidly. The third strategic issue was: “How do we prevent littering, especially marine littering?” Studies by the Italian institute for the environment showed that 73% of all the marine littering along the coastline of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Adriatic</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> was plastic bags.

I do not believe we really have sufficient evidence about the degradation of any of these materials </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">in the natural environment.

The few studies that we have suggest that degradation is going to be relatively slow. There certainly haven’t been studies in the deep sea. What we found from our own studies is that these bags get fouled by marine organisms relatively rapidly in the seas, which, if ultraviolet light is a catalyst—as it is for some of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">oxo</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> bags—will mean it is greatly reduced. We found that the amount of light reaching the surface of the bag was reduced by 70% or 80% relatively quickly in the sea, so that is going to slow down the rates of degradation. I am very concerned about some ultimately ending up as fragments.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Zac Goldsmith:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We are not talking about—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Thompson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> No, I am talking about any bag that we put in the sea will become fouled relatively quickly and if ultraviolet light is important in terms of the breakdown of that material, then the sea is going to reduce that anyway—because it is going to be attenuated by the water—but the fouling of marine organisms is going to reduce that further. So the deeper the item is—and we know that carrier bags are present in the deep sea, they are buried in sediments and present at the sea surface—so the rates of degradation are likely to be considerably slower. We have not got a complete picture of evidence, but I am certainly very concerned that, if we were to adopt something that we were considering was biodegradable, it was genuinely biodegradable into carbon dioxide and water, could be assimilated by micro-organisms and marine life relatively rapidly, and we were absolutely confident that it was not fragmenting into </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">microplastic</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> fragments.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q127</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Zac Goldsmith:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> And there is nothing to your mind yet that would fit that criterion?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">David Newman:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> There is nothing that would fit that criterion that I would be confident would. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q128</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Zac Goldsmith:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Would you include in that the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">oxo</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">David Newman:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes, I would.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Michael Stephen:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> There is something to my mind that would fit the criterion.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q129</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Zac Goldsmith:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Let me guess.

The difference is that at the end of its life, the piece of plastic is not burned in the same way as the fuel is in a car or an aeroplane. You have got a renewable resource here, and at the end of its life you recycle it. The idea of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">biofuel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is to make the fuel source more sustainable, so you are not relying on a fossil source.

Now, the amount in plastic bags might be quite trivial, but I don’t see it as the main direction of travel in terms of resolving the problems of the sustainable use of resources. It is far better to use the end-of-life material and reduce the plastic going into the waste stream than to rely on a crop. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Michael Stephen:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I must disagree with the professor.

In that case, it is there in the film, so when we get film back to our recycling plant it is there.

Here is some waste. That is what it looks like; I thought I would help you conceptualise it. In there could well be a carrier bag containing degradable product. We recycle that and it comes out looking like a pellet, and in the pellet could be a degradable additive. In the recycling process we just shred it, melt it and turn it back into pellet. It does not make the degradable additive disappear; it is still there. It is there when we make damp-proof membrane coursing, which has a very long shelf life. Can you imagine the liability for our company if in 20 years’ time the damp-proof membrane course that we put down on the bricks starts degrading? Before Mr Stephen says that it needs oxygen, with damp-proof membrane both edges are exposed to oxygen. We have a big risk here. So, what’s the way round it? Mr Stephen will tell us, no doubt—I’m helping him out here—that there are neutralising agents which can be put in. We think that they are antioxidants.
