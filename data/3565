It is an increasingly complex economic environment, not least the cost</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">cutting</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and the constraints that we all know about in local authorities, but also in terms of the demands on professionals to deliver new service models—new contractual models. Perhaps moving from dealing with major corporations to dealing with small to medium</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">sized</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> enterprise, for example, introduces a degree of complexity in some cases. I also think there is an increasing focus generally in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> on better outcomes from procurement and contracting, which is shining a light more and more on procurement professionals in particular to demonstrate better results from the process. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr David Barrett</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I should say that I am here today representing Transparency International, partly because I was the researcher on this report about corruption risks in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> local government. One of the things that we found in the research for the report is that although there have been quite a lot of improvements in terms of probity in recent years in public procurement in many stages of the process—partly, it seems, pushed by the EU procurement directive and partly by the framework for checking standards around that—there is one area where there seemed to be quite a lot of concerns that the checks were less rigorous, and that was the area of contract implementation. At the post-award phase of procurement, several of the people that we consulted in the research suggested that this might be an area to watch. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In terms of other drivers of probity, another issue that emerged in the research for the report is that many of the checks on procurement probity are being weakened with some of the recent changes to legislation and the checks and balances around the conduct of both officers and elected members in local government. For example, one tool that used to exist, which was operated by the Audit Commission, was something called the use of resources, which was a mechanism for checking how local authorities were using their resources, and this had a whole section around public procurement. It seems that what this did is require local authorities to say what they were doing in this particular area to conform to best practice standards; and on the basis of their submissions they were then rated and given a kind of score. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It seems that that was quite good at driving standards forward, partly because there was a kind of reputational mechanism and authorities were in some sense competing with one another to get a good grade on that system, and that was driving them forward. It also allowed the Audit Commission, in setting the standards that they required local authorities to report on, to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">gradually up the standards and put in place additional areas and additional lines of inquiry that they were asking about. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think we can probably follow up on that audit point a little bit later in more detail. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr David Barrett</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Just to be brief: yes, that is a key thing that is now lacking. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Ian O</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">’</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Donnell</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think the desire to provide good quality services to residents is one of the primary things driving councils. They have articulate and vocal customers these days who are keen to hold them to account at the ballot box—or, indeed, through JR or challenge to the procurement process. Other factors include innovation, which is driven by technology, and the fear of failure, which is one of the reasons why councils have as much procedure around the procurement process as they do. There is also a need to provide more for less, because of rising expectations from customers, rising demand for services and, of course, the reducing resources in the public sector. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">On the question of probity and fairness, I think it is true to say that this is very much already embedded in the way that councils go about doing their procurement, and that has been caused by the fact that they face a very significant level of scrutiny and the risk of challenge, in a way that perhaps the private sector does not. Over the years there have been a number of rules put in place to assist councils in meeting the sorts of standards approaching fairness that are required from them—things like compulsory competitive tendering, which some years ago introduced some rules around this; the EU procurement rules obviously; the best value regime; freedom of information; and, more recently, the transparency regime. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The emphasis on transparency is undoubtedly a very good thing, but we would argue that it needs to be tempered by the need not to stifle innovation by councils or by their contractors. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q187 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> As a follow</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">up point, how should we judge whether a council is effective in its procurement—or, indeed, how should councils themselves judge that? Is value for money so important now that it almost overwhelms everything else in terms of procurement and looking at what is good practice and what is not? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Mallory</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes, absolutely. The need to focus on the in</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">life</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> part of contract management goes on to that point as well. The probity probably is there in the pre</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">award</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> tendering phase—it is a very clear requirement. Probably there is more that can be done in in</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">life</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> contract management—in other words, the measurement of performance or the checking that goes on during the life of the contract. That is an area that we would see contributing greatly to value for money. The danger with a procurement function is that all of the focus can be on getting to the contract and getting to the right price, and at that point, of course, you have not determined the final cost at the end of the project—I am talking about the more longer-term, perhaps more complex projects. There is a need to proactively manage through the life of the contract. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr David Barrett</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Similarly, something that should be embedded in that value-for-money definition, apart from the price, is safety considerations. Often what you see with corruption in public procurement is that safety ends up being compromised by the use of substandard products. Similarly, if competition is unfair as a result of corruption in the procurement process, then that can mean that companies that are offering value for money are driven out of the market—they are not winning the contracts because there is corruption occurring in the process. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Ian O</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">’</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Donnell</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Councils measure success in procurement by looking at the level of budget savings that they make from undertaking the exercise.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">They consider whether the contract meets the required service standards, and they monitor that very carefully.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">They ensure that they meet the probity standards that are required.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Councils are determined not to fail and, in fact, have a relatively good record compared </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">with</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> some other parts of the public sector in letting contracts.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In terms of measuring their own performance, councils will benchmark their costs against each other</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and CIPFA, in fact, runs a number of benchmarking clubs that assist councils to do this.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It is our view that councils do at this time have the sorts of skills, expertise and capabilities that enable them to procure their needs. However, there is a need for them to continue to develop as new methods come along, innovation comes along. What we see happening with councils is that they are using private sector consultants and other, similar resources, like CIPFA and institutes, to support their procurement professionals, not only in measuring the progress that they are making, but in developing expertise and taking on the sort of innovation that is available. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q188 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">John Stevenson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I want to build on what has been said already about skills and capacity within local government. Do you think councils have those skills to deal with the contracts at the tendering stage and then obviously monitor the contracts as they develop over the years? Do the councils have those skills now? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Mallory</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes, sure. It would be fair to say there is scope for improvement—there always is, regardless of which sector we look at, public or private. The organisation I work for is a professional association for commercial and contract management, and we have global members, so we get to see quite a range of different skills and abilities in many different countries. There is always scope for improvement; one of the difficulties for professionals working in the local government area is the relative isolation of those practitioners in their particular local authority. We would like to see a lot more done to create critical mass by bringing more professionals together, and networking. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q189 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">John Stevenson:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal">Collaboration between </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">councils</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal">—you see that as a way of improving the skills? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Mallory</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes, in terms of skills collaboration, quite aside from economic collaboration; yes, I think skills collaboration would help a lot.

They do not get to see many examples; they just see what crosses their desk, so the more we can do to network professionals and help them to share experience and examples would help a lot. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr David Barrett</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> One problem that came up in the research is that there might be expertise within a local authority around procurement, but that is mainly employed in the pre</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">award</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and award phases. Then what happens is there is often a separation, in that the contract implementation is managed by the particular part of the local authority that is giving the service—so, if it is the IT department, then the IT department. At that point you might get a disjuncture, where the expertise of the procurement part of the council is not being employed to benefit the monitoring stage of the contract. There might just be a lack of awareness about what exactly the objectives and terms of the contract were, or the department that is the client is not fully paying attention to ensure that the contract is fulfilled. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q190 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">John Stevenson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> How would you rectify that? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr David Barrett</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It would be important to join up those bits to ensure that the procurement function is playing a role in checking the monitoring, or this could be something that is done by the audit function, in terms of ensuring that the contract is implemented as foreseen.

What tends to happen is that a contract will run for a number of years, so the officers who were involved in letting that contract and then implementing it will then not have any experience of doing another implementation until the contract is let again, which could be five or seven years later. Typically, the officers managing a contract would not be skilled in that process, and they would need a lot of support from the procurement team within the council. Part of the problem is how you ensure that those officers are properly trained and equipped to implement and manage a contract, given that they rarely get the opportunity to exercise all of those skills. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Training is the key to this: we would say that local authorities largely do have well</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">trained</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> procurement staff, but we would also agree that there is always scope for improvement. The collaboration work that is going on between councils at the moment is generating a new tier of procurement experts—these are people who are working across a number of different councils and typically would be working for a consortium. As a result, they may be being paid higher salaries. Certainly those salaries do not match anything like the sorts of salaries that would be paid to a purchasing head in the private sector in a company that is worldwide or even national, but that means there is a chance of attracting expertise into those roles that an individual council possibly would not be able to afford. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q194 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">John Stevenson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> As a generalisation, do you think the skill base is quite good in local government? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Ian O</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">’</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Donnell</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q195 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">John Stevenson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You do.

In managing the contract, there are lots of risks that officers have to deal with, not least the risk of fraud and bad behaviour by the contractor. What I would say is that councils seem to be getting better at this, and have come to understand much more than they did before that a good contract is one that delivers the right benefits for both sides. Typically now, rather than getting into a dispute with a contractor and letting that end up in court, councils will enter into dialogue with a contractor and seek to resolve the issues through dialogue, understanding the outcomes that both sides need in order to deliver services. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q196 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">John Stevenson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you think the private sector has a role in the procurement process, in terms of helping the council ensure that it is implemented correctly? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Ian O</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">’</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Donnell</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think the private sector is already contributing to that through a variety of different consultancies that provide expertise to councils on a routine basis.

It is one of the ways of helping individuals to benchmark themselves, because one of the difficulties here is that if you are sitting in a particular organisation, you do not necessarily know how you stand—nine out of 10 people believe they are above average. I did that survey recently, and nine out of 10 people put their hands up. It is quite hard to tell, if you are sitting in a particular organisation, how you are benchmarking externally, so skills assessment and those kinds of mechanisms can help.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q198 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Simon Danczuk:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Starting with you Ian, how much do you think we are losing to fraud and impropriety? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Ian O</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">’</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Donnell</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The National Fraud Authority publishes an annual fraud indicator, in which it looks at all of the sectors in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> economy and estimates the loss to fraud by each of those sectors.

There is no doubt about it: it seems to take longer to get through the procurement process in the UK compared with the European Union, perhaps for some of the reasons that you were just outlining there. It seems a very thorough process to go through, but we still have £800-odd million worth of fraud in local government. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Elizabeth</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, do you have a view on this? Is it going to become more likely as we contract more work out to the private sector? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr David Barrett</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I am not sure if it is going to become more or less likely. What I would say is that the accountability becomes more complex, so although local government retains the responsibility for holding those private providers of public services to account, it becomes more difficult for the public to know to whom they should complain if they suspect that there is a problem. I think that sometimes the local authorities are less involved in and less interested in holding those private providers to account, because they have also outsourced that function. This means that transparency becomes more important, because you rely more on the public for holding them to account. We should not compromise the transparency and accountability because we have changed who the provider is, and there is a risk that those things could be compromised if the institutional checks are not in place. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q215 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Simon Danczuk:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> That is a really good point.

In fact, many practitioners in local authorities have come to see that as more important than obtaining the best possible value for money. That </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">drives a process</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">driven</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> approach, and we would argue that that potentially stifles innovation by councils. On the other side of the equation, contractors improve value for money by seeking market advantage and innovating. The publication of information about the way in which they are delivering a contract can potentially give away some of the innovations that they have made to market competitors, and therefore they lose their advantage by doing it, which potentially discourages innovation by contractors. Our argument is that it is very important to strike the right balance between probity and allowing councils and contractors to innovate and take risk. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q217 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Heather Wheeler:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think quite a bit of my question has been answered, so I will move on a little bit. I am interested in the future and how changes to the audit arrangements for councils could impact on the likelihood of impropriety and fraud in procurement. If somebody was setting out now to take advantage of new audit arrangements, where do you think the attacks are likely to come? Let us get in first—your expert opinion. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Mallory</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I would like to hand that over. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr David Barrett</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> In a way, the attacks could come anywhere; the point is that we would not be able to detect them, because of the change in the audit function. The risk with the new audit regime is that the independence of external auditors is potentially compromised by the fact that they are concerned about winning the next contract from the local authority. With local authorities appointing their own external auditors, those external auditors are incentivised not to challenge the local authority too much for fear that they would not get either this contract renewed or that they would not win other contracts with the local authority for providing other services. One of the issues that emerged in the research for the report was that many audit companies are providing not only audit services to local authorities, but also other back-office functions. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q218 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Heather Wheeler:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> There have to be clear separations. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr David Barrett</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> There should be a clear separation, and there is a risk that they might not bring up or challenge something under the audit for fear of losing other business.

One of the concerns that arises out of that is that, given that Cabinet Office may well have a different view about how the NFI can be used, there is a possibility that local government may not be the focus of attention for the NFI in the future. That may mean that it is not developed in the way that local government would need it to be developed in order to deliver data-matching results for it. That is one issue that we would fear from the changes that are taking place. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Whether the external auditor has a great deal of influence upon the detection of fraud is a good question. It is rarely the case that the external auditor is the first port of call when fraud or corruption is being reported; they tend to be brought in at a later stage, when perhaps there has not been a response from the council and a whistleblower is unsatisfied with the response that they have had. The NAO does indeed have a role to play in terms of supporting those district auditors, but one of the things that we would not want to see is the emergence of a new, heavily resourced body, just to support local government, that looks just like the Audit Commission. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q223 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Heather Wheeler:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes, quite.

A lot more can be done: research shows that whistleblowers </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">are still typically heavily penalised for raising concerns at work. Public Concern at Work did some research earlier this year on this, which found that, of those cases where the whistleblower gets a response at all, around about one fifth are fired or have some very hostile reaction. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">One very important thing is that the whistleblower feels that their concern is going to be investigated and investigated by some external body that is not just going to call their superior and say, “This complaint has been made,” because that is the position in which they feel very vulnerable that they are just going to be reprimanded, ostracised or rebuked for taking this action. Another thing would be that there should be some more institutional support, so the current PIDA regime relies very much on individuals invoking the law if something goes wrong, to protect their individual right. It would be much better if we had some support for whistleblowers that made sure nothing went wrong—that they did not get a hostile reaction for raising something that is in the public interest. A lot more could be done in terms of institutional support for them. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It would be good to have systems in place that examine the records of local authorities in dealing with whistleblowers—how many complaints they get, how they deal with them, checking that they are managing them in the right way. We could require local authorities to report on </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">whistleblowing</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.

The study that was done by Public Concern at Work found that there was very little difference between sectors in this, and the typical whistleblower will raise their issue a couple of times with management and is most likely to experience absolutely no response at all—that is what the study showed.

On the point you were just making, it definitely is a pattern that competitive tendering processes tend to drive people to a very low price—maybe this is not fraud but just bad management—but they are then looking to make up that price to a reasonable level later on, perhaps through change control, perhaps through other means. During the tendering process it is important to look at the results and try to make some assessment of whether it is a real price. I believe a very low price should be questioned as much as a very high price. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q238 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Bob Blackman:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> In the evidence you talk about the monitoring of these contracts—that often it is the user department monitoring rather than the procurement people, who know what they have agreed.

For example, a contract award can end up in a scrutiny committee, which is, of course, a public meeting, and there can be a debate about that contract award if it is called in. In addition to that, they can be subject to challenge, either under EU rules or through judicial review. Councils constantly need to be aware that they might be asked to explain their thinking and explain their process. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q243 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">John Pugh:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You recognise that EU regulations probably reduce the prospect of fraud, do they not? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Ian O</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">’</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Donnell</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: That is right, and all of that process is in place to try to reduce the risk of failure and the risk of fraud; that is correct. Our concern is that that can stifle innovation and can make councils focus on process rather than outcomes. However, having said that, there are some very good innovations going on at the moment. Councils are making new markets. For example, in Ealing, where I work, we have recently let a contract for libraries and leisure together—that is something that has not been done before. We went about that by going to talk to the market and found out whether they would be interested in a different kind of contract involving a different combination of services, and whether that would deliver any extra value for us. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Councils are also looking at opportunities with small and medium</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">sized</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> businesses, and local businesses, in a way that they were not before, looking at social value and the way in which that can contribute.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q244 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">John Pugh:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do they find it sits happily with the EU procurement rules? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Ian O</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">’</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Donnell</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q245 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">John Pugh:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Paul, are there any changes you would like to see in the EU procurement rules to make life easier for your members? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Mallory</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I am sure there are probably many.

For example, in a TUPE </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">situation, where the council is transferring staff with pensions to an external supplier and the external supplier is going to become a member of the pension scheme as an admitted body, that creates a scenario in which, in fact, it is more expensive typically for the contractor to manage the risk around that pension commitment than it is for the council to retain it themselves for the life of the contract.

What I would say is that there is always a danger with these close, cosy relationships, we might say, that people become less diligent than they might be, or they become a little bit less clearly applying the rules than they might otherwise do, because of the close relationship. It seems to me you always have to differentiate between a professional relationship and a personal one, and there needs to be a clear separation of those things.

For individual employees—I am thinking of things like IT outsourcing, for example, having worked in that sector myself for a while—quite often that is very positive from a career point of view for the individuals being outsourced, because they join a professional community of likeminded people. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q259 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Bob Blackman:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> They potentially get access to other types of opportunities as a result. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Mallory</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes, absolutely. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q260 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Bob Blackman:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What about the impact on the staffing, in terms of redundancies, pensions, their contractual hours, their rates of pay, et cetera?

We are working towards it, and my point is that it is unaffordable immediately. It is going to take a period of some years. As contracts come up and we renew them, some of them we will be able to switch into Living Wage; some of them we will not be able to afford to do the first time around, and we will have to plan for it over quite a considerable period. Certainly, Living Wage is not going to bring about an immediate shift in whether those private sector contractors are paying a living wage to their staff. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Pensions are another issue. If, once staff have transferred, over time a contractor moves them away from a local government scheme and into a private sector scheme that does not offer the same benefits, that is perfectly feasible, and typically a private sector scheme does not offer the same sorts of benefits that the local government scheme does. There is a big question about whether the local government scheme is affordable at the moment. We are looking at that, but again, it is an erosion in terms of terms and conditions. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q268 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Bob Blackman:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Could I just pick up on the pension issue? One of the problems that can happen is that a contractor wins a contract for three years, four years, five years, and then at the end of that they lose the contract. The staff then transfer to another company or come back to the authority, or whatever. As an employee, you can end up with a whole series of different pensions with different pension schemes. Have local authorities looked at that as a specific example of where individuals need to be protected? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Ian O</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">’</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Donnell</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes. Typically what will happen is that the private sector company will be allowed to set up as part of the local authority scheme, as an admitted body, which means that the benefits for the employee would be the same. However, the problem with it is that the employer contribution rate might well be different within that admitted body—an actuary will look at things like the life expectancy of the individuals working for the company where the transfer has taken place—and that could make it very expensive to be a member of that scheme. It goes back to what I was saying earlier on. Sometimes it is better to manage that risk by capping the contributions that the contractor has to make towards the costs of the pensions, and meeting them through the council’s own resources; it can work out more cheaply. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q269 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Bob Blackman:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Can I raise the last issue, which is zero</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">hours</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> contracts?

The other side of the equation is that hopefully that would be reflected by a reduction in council tax paid by local people, because they are benefitting from a saving that has been achieved through letting the contract externally. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q277 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chris Williamson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Have you got evidence that council tax is reduced as a result of contracting out? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Ian O</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">’</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Donnell</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There is certainly a lot of evidence of council tax being held in recent times by a number of councils through their achieving efficiencies, not only through contracts but through a range of other things as well. It would be hard to pin it down to a particular contract, but certainly outsourcing and working with the private sector has contributed to councils being able to make savings and thereby manage the local council tax. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q278 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chris Williamson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Finally, would you say that that offsets any potential negative impact on the local economy as a result of less money being in that local economy in the area where the council has externalised its activities to another part of the country—that is, that the reduction in council tax has offset any loss of spending in the local economy? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Ian O</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">’</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Donnell</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is very hard to say; you would have to look at it on a case</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">by</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">case</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> basis. If, for example, it was the type of activity that is very labour intensive and, therefore, involves the employment of a lot of manual workers, and that work was then outsourced—so a number of manual workers through attrition were no longer required—then you could say that that might have a serious impact on the local economy, because they might find it difficult to find another job to move into. In another type of activity, it may not be an issue at all. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Thank you very much indeed for coming and giving evidence to us.
