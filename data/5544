Good morning, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Sören</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. Thank you so much for sparing your valuable time to come and talk to us today. One of the many inquiries that we have underway at the moment relates to local government and its relationship with central government, the financial interaction that takes place there. We are really looking forward to hearing your expertise on international comparisons and how things work in other places. Lars and </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Sören</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, would you like to make a general statement or tell us anything in particular before we begin</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">questioning?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lars Andersson</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: Yes, if we could do a short introduction that would be fine. First, let me say that </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Sören</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> and I work together; we form a very small think-tank in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Sweden</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> where we work with questions about the future challenges of local government. I am also specialised in municipal </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">finance</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, working with the Local Government Association here on the project of a municipal bond agency. I am also working in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">France</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> with the agency that has been set up recently. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">We wanted to give a really short introduction to set the scene. I think you have some of our PowerPoint slides and I would like to refer to a couple of them at the beginning. First, page 2, levels of local democracy. In </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Sweden</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> we have two different types of local government: municipalities, which were reformed in the 1970s and reduced from a far bigger number down to 290, and 20 county councils and regions. These two different local governments have different competencies and they have their own finances. It is not a question of the county council being above the local authorities. They have different responsibilities. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Looking at the tasks for local government on page 4, you can see that education and care of the elderly are the two biggest areas for local government. As is the case in the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, we will see further challenges when it comes to care of the elderly since we are getting older. That is one thing that local government have to address in the future. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The financing, finally: if you look at page 3 there is income distribution. We have local income tax, which is about 67% of the total income. The central government grants are mainly block grants but during the last maybe 10 years we have seen a tendency to centralisation again in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Sweden</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, with more earmarked grants. We hope that this will not go any further but that is a development. I will stop there and hand over to </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Sören</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sören Häggroth</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: Thank you for this invitation. My background is in the ministries and mainly in finance. I was State Secretary in the Ministry of Finance for five years, so I have been working very much with the financial side but also with the legal side of local self-government. I have handed out a small essay that I use when I lecture about local government in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Sweden</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> when people come from Asia and </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Africa</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">I think it is fair to say that not only </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Sweden</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> but all the Nordic countries, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Norway</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Finland</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> and </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Denmark</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, are </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">very</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> decentralised societies. This situation goes back in history because the people were living in very different parts of the nations and it was impossible for the king, and later the government, to direct the population scattered through the country. The modern local self-government came into being after the Second World War when the economy was growing and it was possible to increase healthcare services, childcare services and so on. The two amalgamation reforms that Lars referred to were carried out in order to strengthen the local governments. The goal was that no local authority would have fewer than 8,000 inhabitants. At the moment we have depopulation, so we have around 100 local authorities with fewer than 8,000 inhabitants; the median size is 15,000 in a population of 9.5 million. The biggest municipality or city is </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Stockholm</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> with 900,000 and the smallest has only 3,000, so there is a wide range of population sizes. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">In the material that you have received is the regulation concerning local government in our constitution. Our present constitution is from 1974, so this constitution was made about the same time as we had the second amalgamation reform. The political ambition was to give local authorities a position in the constitution. In the first article of the first chapter the constitution lays down the principles of local self-government. Local government has a very important role and this role cannot be violated very much by the Government or by the Parliament. If you want to violate local government in a serious way you have to change the constitution and that demands an election, so it is two Parliaments’ decisions, before and after the election. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">There is a special chapter on local authorities, which you will find also in the documentation. I won’t go through all this. It is only six articles but every one is very basic. One basic principle, for example, is that local authorities can only be ruled by law. Individual Ministers, civil servants and so on cannot introduce decrees or make decisions. It is only by law that local authorities can be ruled. A very recent article is what is called the proportionality principle, which means that any restriction in local self-government should not exceed what is necessary with regard to the purpose of the restriction. Every time the government proposes a new law, the law has to be scrutinised by a special legal advisory team, which gives its opinion on whether or not this law violates the principle of local self-government. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Another very basic article is article 4, which states that local authorities may levy tax for the management of their affairs. This has been violated at some times in history, and I have been part of that process, but I will come back to that later if you want to hear more details about this. This principle is very important also. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">I think that is enough for the time being concerning the legal regulation in the constitution. I will stop there and we are happy to answer your questions. Thank you very much.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q2 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Thank you, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Sören</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">.

Thank you very much for the presentation. It has been fascinating to read it. The Chairman accuses me of being a cynic, but I just recall that we had a local government reorganisation in 1974, which is long forgotten. It was an utter disaster. I think we envy the Nordic countries: they do take policies on the basis of some kind of evidence and ours are obviously entirely based on irrational evidence-free prejudice, if that is cynical, but it happens to be true unfortunately, the difference between the two countries. The real enormous difference between England and Sweden is, of course, the way that money is collected locally—67% as you say—which would be such a revolutionary change that it probably would produce revolution in local authorities if they were asked to cough up money in that way. Can you think of anything in the Swedish system that we could usefully borrow, usefully emulate, in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">England</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lars Andersson</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: Talking about the local taxes, I think that the income taxes that are financing our local authorities have been working very well. It is a flat tax—it is a percentage and the average now is 31% or something like that. What we have had in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Sweden</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> before is property tax, but that has been redone in several steps. There is a discussion now, which we support very much, on introducing a new property tax for the local authorities that they would set themselves. It is important to have the proper </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">financing,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> otherwise you can’t have the sort of independence that you are striving to get. I have been reading your report about reallocating the tax money and setting part of it to local authorities. I think that that would be one good </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">idea,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> because you need to have financing otherwise it will be a hollow reform.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q4 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Paul Flynn:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> How rare is it? Is it only in the Nordic countries where there is this predominance of income coming from local authorities? Do other parts of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> collect money in that way as well or is it collected centrally?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lars Andersson</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: Since I have been advising the French local authority organisations, I know a bit about </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">France</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. When I first started to work with them four or five years ago, I had a view that </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">France</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> was a </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">very</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> centralised country, but then I started to work with the LGA here in the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> and I can see that they are very decentralised. You might say that </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Sweden</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> has a situation where we collect around 67% in taxes for financing and I can’t remember the figure here in the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> but is it around 20%?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Paul Flynn:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> It is much lower than that, about 7%.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lars Andersson</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: In </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">France</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> it is about 40%, so it is not as high as in the Nordic countries but you can see that there is much greater independence in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">France</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. Right now they are putting through a decentralisation reform in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">France</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, working very hard. It is not done yet and we have not seen the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">outcome of it. The fact is that in France you have 36,000 local authorities, which is far too many but in a way it proves that local government has strength, because the central government have tried to do reforms several times but they can’t do it because local government is too strong.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q5 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Paul Flynn:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> I think the Bretons and the Basques that I know would take issue with you about how much power they have, when they are not even allowed to get state funding to teach in their own languages. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">On the question of improvement, there is an incurable belief in the value of reorganisation.

We have something now called localism, which translated means you devolve those decisions to local authorities that you don’t want to take yourself because they are politically damaging. We go through these cycles of centralisation and then devolution, and it comes back and forward. I can’t think of any reorganisation, in my 42 years in government, where the results have compensated for and been worth the chaos, waste and duplication of the reorganisation. Change has rarely proved itself of any value. Is that your view? To copy the splendid things that you are doing in the Nordic countries would cause change here that almost certainly would do great damage and results that were of nugatory value.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lars Andersson</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: I totally agree that constant changes will cause inefficiencies, but then again sometimes you have to adjust the system and I think there is room for that in the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> because of the centralised system you have.

One idea concerns how money is being transferred from the central government to local councils. After the amalgamation reform in 1974 we have not made any very extensive structural changes, like amalgamating local authorities, but we have changed the legislation and especially the way money has been transferred from the centre to the local level. During the 1990s, when </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Sweden</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> was having a very bad economic crisis and the revenues for the whole public sector went down, the national government started several reforms in order to give greater freedom to local authorities. We pulled together, in the Ministry of Finance, around 50 special state grants in one bag—it was called the bag principle. It was a block grant system. When the national level could not give more money they gave more freedom, and there are several examples of this kind. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">One advantage with local income tax, as we see it—and I can understand the problems that you would have if you introduced it—is that you establish a direct connection between what people are paying and what they get in the form of education and services. It is a very transparent system for financing public services and education. I have full respect for problems changing the system but I think there are several advantages in local income taxes. There are also disadvantages because the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">income tax that we have is proportionate, it is not progressive, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">so</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> people pay the same percentage of their incomes. That sets certain limits to having very high local income tax levels.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> You are probably aware, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Sören</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, that we suggested that governments and political parties could look at the concept, not of a locally defined and collected income tax, but what is called tax assignment, so that it would be collected as now at the same rates as now, the same equalisation as now, but would be assigned. This is building on a precedent in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, where 10 pence of the income tax take is retained by </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. That is currently also on offer to Wales, but I think our Committee was quite keen that what is good enough for Scotland and Wales could also be good enough for Northern Ireland and England. In that sense, we did not propose the creation of an entirely new system but </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">a finesse</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> on the existing system that would allow greater transparency and clarity, which you were saying, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Sören</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, exists when you do collect locally.

I am interested on the last point that Fabian and the Chairman asked you about. Given that you have your elections on the same day, do you have any evidence, perhaps academic research or whatever, that demonstrates whether individual voters will vote differently in political terms between the different levels?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sören Häggroth</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: Yes, there is quite extensive research about this. The interesting result of this research is that people over time, from the beginning of the 1970s, split their votes to an increasing degree. There is also research that shows that people get more and more informed of the policies of different parties at the local level. From the beginning, some people, some political parties, were very negative to the amalgamation because there were fewer local councillors who could be contacted, but over time the newspapers, local television and broadcasting companies have been more and more active, reflecting what is happening in the local councils and in the county councils. So nowadays people are quite aware of the differences between the parties and that has had this consequence of splitting votes. Of course it is not 100% but it is increasing all the time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q12 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Robert Neill:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> That is very interesting.

One of the issues that I had raised with me when I was a Minister by our finance industry and is part of the public debate is that in the UK we have the rules about the public sector borrowing requirement and we also have the Treasury’s accounting rules as to what borrowing goes on to the public debt, on to the public books. The argument has been that because in the UK the Government ultimately will be the lender of last resort to a local authority and will ultimately underwrite its borrowings, municipal bonds would count against the public borrowing, at a time when for other reasons of public policy we wish to reduce it. Do you encounter that same problem in Sweden and, if so, how do you get round it, or do you have a set of public accounting rules that are different from our Treasury’s that mean that obstacle does not arise?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lars Andersson</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: If you compare local government borrowing to central government borrowing, local government borrowing is so small. I think here in the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> the local government borrowing is around 5% of GDP whereas the central government’s is 80% or something, so it is really very small.

The answer of, course, was yes, and that affected the rating outcome for the local government. So even though it was not spelled out in some formal document, it was a common understanding—Minister of Finance, Parliament, local government, rating institutes—that the state was there at the end of the day when needed.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q20 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Robert Neill:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> That is very helpful.

We have an equalisation system in the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> as well, which is broadly </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">on a needs</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> versus resources equation. Yours is done slightly differently with a guaranteed percentage of income. The argument that is sometimes made to me—although I think everybody agrees you need it for all the reasons you set out—is that some forms of equalisation model can be a disincentive for local authorities to maximise efficiency. If you happen to be comparatively well blessed with resource you don’t get much reward for being efficient in the way in which you use those resources, and that sometimes lack of resource can be used as a means of masking a desire to drive out inefficiency because you think you will be compensated through the equalisation. Do you come across that in your system and, if so, how do you deal with it?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sören Häggroth</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: I have been working very much with the equalisation system and at the end of this process of 10 or 15 years I was bored so I decided to do something else. It is a very technically complicated system so of course these </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">kind</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> of risks may occur, but this has been a discussion item for decades. The solution to avoid this problem of inefficiencies is that—we have two kinds. You define a standard cost that is the average cost, for example, for one pupil aged 10. This concept of the standard cost means that you get a certain sum of money for every individual who is part of this system. If you are ineffective then the taxpayers in the municipality will have to pay and if you are efficient then you will gain from the system because you will get these standard costs. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">I think the discussion about disincentives nowadays mostly centres </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">around</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> the other part of the system, that is income equalisation. We have cost equalisation and income equalisation. The argument in the discussion concerning income equalisation is that if you have this guarantee of 115%, which is the level at the moment, then you will have no incentive to get more taxpayers to the municipality, and there has not been a good solution to that problem, I must say. I think personally that maybe they also say that this income equalisation creates disincentives. I think they exaggerate this argument because still you favour by getting new taxpayers. I have not met one local politician who doesn’t want another inhabitant in the municipality unless it is a person with heavy social problems who will have costs.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Robert Neill:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> That is very helpful.

In that case, what relationship is there between central and local government in terms of directing the actions of local authorities, their responsibilities, which I assume are set by the constitution, or indeed setting the powers they have in relation to raising taxes?

If you are a Minister you cannot take the telephone and call the local councillor and tell him what to do. That is impossible. It is not permitted by the constitution. So you have to have a law in order to direct individual local authorities and county councils. Then of course the law may contain rules giving authority to a state agency to have further rules for the implementation. In education, for example, there are lots of rules concerning what the pupils should learn and so on and in social services you have not so many binding rules but you have recommendations from the agency of social welfare.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q22 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Fabian </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Hamilton</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> May I interrupt you for a moment just to ask what happens if there is a conflict between what Parliament sets as a law for the local authority and the constitution?

What is important here is that direction comes from law, ordinances and inspections, and inspections are being reported to the local councillors. It is very seldom that state agencies can put another decision in the place of a decision made by a local council.

Those </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">kind</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> of issues are on the political agenda all the time. When I was State Secretary at the Ministry of Finance we had quite formal negotiations. Of course we had almost day-to-day discussions with leading politicians but we also had negotiations, which we put down in documents and those documents were made public. If you really want to study how you can create arrangements for solving conflicts, I think </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Denmark</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> could be interesting for you to study. They have very structured and organised negotiations between the Government and the association of local authorities. We don’t have that in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Sweden</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> at the moment but we used to have it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q25 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Mark Durkan:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> You referred to both tiers of local government in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Sweden</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> and they have, as I see it, different responsibilities. There is an emphasis on health at the county or regional government level. I am assuming that is on acute services, the big costly services like hospitals with bigger catchments, but there is also reference to public health and welfare and elderly care at the level of the municipalities. I represent a constituency in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Northern Ireland</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> and we have a slightly different model for delivering health and social care there as from here in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">England</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, but nevertheless it is in that area that huge challenges are faced no matter what the model is. What do you find are the main challenges facing local government in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Sweden</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> in relation to health and social care at the different levels of government? It is very hard, given the importance of those issues in people’s lives and the changing dynamic in terms of demand for services and technology. Who takes the decisions there for policy responses to those ever changing challenges? Where is the policy dynamic in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Sweden</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> when it comes to confronting new challenges?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lars Andersson</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: We do have this demographic challenge that almost every country in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> is facing. The UK and Sweden are in a bit more favourable position than, for example, Germany, because the population is increasing in Sweden as well whereas in Germany it is decreasing and they are getting so many in the elderly groups. I think the healthcare system will be a great challenge for local authorities. We have been discussing whether some parts of the healthcare system should be taken care of by the central government—that is the specialised hospitals—because otherwise now there is a question of different types of health services in different parts of the country. There is a big discussion about that. Maybe it is a requirement in the future that you are a bit more centralised when it comes to the specialists, because in healthcare you find new methods and new ways of doing things and this needs to be co-ordinated in a better way than it is today I think.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q26 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Mark Durkan:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> How do you do that without creating tensions?

If you look at the Nordic countries, which I have been doing lately, there is a very interesting tendency to stimulate innovations. The state has taken initiatives to increase innovations especially in the medical services to get new drugs, methods of treatment, processes and so on, and in those cases the state is very active in introducing this kind of new methods of working with the healthcare services. So even though local authorities and county councils will have big responsibilities to meet these demographic challenges, I think the state must be very active in supporting in different ways, financially, new methods and so on, in order to have a good situation for the private people.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lars Andersson</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: We were talking about incentives before and in a way you might say that the Swedish local government have a situation that is a bit too good. Their income has increased every year and therefore there is a lack of debate within local government about these challenges. Local government in the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> have had a very clear alarm clock when you had the cuts in government grants.

I think you have gone much further here in the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> when it comes to these questions. We think, “We get a little bit more money each year, we can do it the same way,” and this is a problem. The lack of debate in local government about future challenges is a problem. We are trying to stir up that debate with our writings.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q27 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Mark Durkan:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> That was partly what I wanted to see, because I am hugely interested on the financing end of things, as the Chairman said, as a former Finance Minister, in which capacity I used to tell people that I didn’t suffer from depression but I was a carrier. The issue does arise that in these services when you are looking to change service models, somebody is going to have take a lead to say what we have done up until now and the familiar service sites we have are going to have to change for something else, and that can lead to controversies and difficulties. It is really where the policy dynamic for taking on challenges lies in the model that you have been describing, that sort of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">thing, that</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> I am basically trying to find out. Finance brings its own challenge and the management of change and necessary change also brings tensions at any level of government, but particularly when you have different levels of government involved. With the synergies that you are talking about between local government, do you think you have seen more policy synergy and initiative going on at a local government level here than you do in Sweden?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lars Andersson</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: I think the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">are</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> going further when it comes to co-operation between local governments. There are several things that local governments do that could be very easily done together with others, like the whole administration, the accounting, for example. It is strange that every small local authority have their own accounting department while they could co-operate with maybe three or four others and do this together, because it is the same.

I was not quite clear, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">are</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> you aware of these Treasury accounting rules that we have in the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> and are they the same?

If local government raises a loan in the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> essentially it is counted as the Government’s borrowing because the Government underwrites, ultimately, the debt for that.

I think the debate when Kommuninvest was formed was whether this organisation could be risky but not a debate about the basic questions. Maybe while talking about a bond agency, one of the reasons in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">England</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> to form a bond agency would be that local government agencies in Europe issue bonds—if you look at the Nordic ones and those in the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Netherlands</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, they issued bonds for about £62 billion in 2012.

For example, Kommuninvest borrows in the Japanese, US, euro markets—they are borrowing in every one of the major markets and of course the domestic market as well. This has led to them going through the recent crisis without any problem. Even the banks have turned to Kommuninvest to ask them to take over the loan portfolio that they have to local authorities to help the banks out with this. Even a big city can’t have that type of diversification. In the case of Kommuninvest, we are talking about €15 billion of borrowing every year. It is a large borrowing requirement and they can go to different markets, they can use different instruments, and there will almost always be some of these that will work.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q33 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Presumably you are very familiar with the fact that in the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, for example, there is a $1 trillion municipal bond market.

First, it is to simplify the system—it says somewhere that it is an overly complex system, and looking into it as a foreigner I can say that it is not that easy to understand every part of it, so simplify for higher efficiency. I think you are talking about a cultural shift and that is also very important. This is one thing that we have been discussing while we were doing the bond agency questions in different countries. A focus on accountability is also another question. This would give a better focus on accountability because, as I said before, local government should not prove to </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Whitehall</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> that they are doing a good job; they should prove it to the voters. Power and finance must go together and that is one thing that you have in this. For me they are the main points in this. I think that Sören had a closer look at the specific parts of the code.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sören Häggroth</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: Just a few remarks. I think the general principles laid down in this draft code are very much in line with the European Charter of Local Self-Government. It is also very much in line with the political thinking in the Nordic countries concerning the role of local governments. Speaking from my experience of ministries, I will imagine you will have some problems in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Whitehall</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> when you confront these colleagues of yours with these principles, but I think they are excellent principles and I would like us to have that kind of legislation in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Sweden</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. I think that would be very good. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Then there are some articles that I do not understand completely. For example, you mention in some articles that there will be a possibility for legal arbitration between local councils and national government, and I was just wondering what kind of arbitration is </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">this?</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> The European Charter demands those kinds of arrangements. We do not have that in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Sweden</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, and we have had some problems with the Council of Europe. If there is a real political conflict between Parliament and one municipality, then there can be some difficulties in having a legal court to settle the dispute. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">I also wondered a little bit about the section dealing with the boundaries of local authorities. You say that it is an issue of councils and their citizens to decide the boundaries. It is very important for local councils and citizens to come to conclusions, but at least in our case in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Sweden</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, and in the other Nordic countries, the Government also has a role to play. Of course, the Government is responsible for the services and cannot allow one municipality to be depopulated and unable to fulfil its commitments to the citizens. Maybe that is something to consider. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Then I was a little bit surprised, I must say, by the role of local referendums. Maybe we are outlaws in this respect in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Sweden</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, but there are local referendums concerning different things, not taxes, not boundaries—sometimes boundaries, actually.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lars Andersson</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: But they are always advising. They are not deciding—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sören Häggroth</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: Yes, advising in the referendums. I think you put a very heavy role on local referendums, and I am sure you have good arguments for this, but I have put a small question mark when I have read this part of the draft code. Then I wondered about—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q35 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Sören, I will answer those questions very briefly, but perhaps you and I could take those further outside.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sören Häggroth</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: Yes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Just to say very quickly, in terms of whether the Executive here, the Government, would tolerate this or not, we are being very careful—very careful indeed—to ensure that they know everything we are talking about and discuss those things. We have had a number of meetings, as a Committee, with Ministers, and a number of seminars. We have also had a Chatham House rules, as we call it—completely off the record—discussion with the Secretary of State and also the Shadow Secretary of State and with officials in Government. In a sense, we are deliberately going slowly because we are trying to not come up with a final answer here but to engender a debate, because all parties, whatever their posture in the House of Commons Chamber, are interested in this area and this balance between the two. I think that has been a very positive and productive process. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">On arbitration, I think you are right. It is nothing more than what is a legal framework if there is a dispute. If central government is given clear rights and local government is given clear rights, one </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">would hope, rather than be a winner-take-all solution, it would be a much better culture of interaction, rather than one party being completely dominant, as it is now, or one institution being completely dominant. At the end of the day, of course the rule of law prevails, and there would be a discussion about that in the court if necessary, but it is almost a symptom of defeat if you get to that point. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:35.45pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">On the boundaries, we are not suggesting doing away with our existing local Boundary Commission, but I think that was much more in view of: rather than wait for a big change for the boundaries, if one local authority agreed with another that a polling district is much more suited, because it is isolated by a motorway or a river, to be with another place then that sort of interaction could operate on a mature level. There is no intention there to depopulate an area or gerrymander. There are very strong and existing rules to prevent that, which would continue the last one about referenda. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:35.45pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:35.45pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">I do not know which version you have there, but colleagues around the table were anxious about the concept of lots of widespread referenda in local government occupying a lot of time. Where we were keen to get people’s consent for local authority issues was where we suggested that, providing it is legal, a local authority should be able to supplement its resources by whatever means it feels it can win the local electorate over to. It is an insurance policy against individual local authorities saying, “Suddenly we are going to impose a local income tax,” or this, that and the other. You must take people with you. I think we have finessed it so that it was either very clear in the manifestoes that we put the parties locally or operate on the basis of the proposition that we talked about locally. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:35.45pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:35.45pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">I think I remember using the example—it is something I care about greatly—</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">of the development of babies, children and young people.

It is a weak point, I admit that.

It is a concept that says, basically, that if an Act of Parliament or law is passed by Parliament it cannot be challenged by the courts, but sometimes that Act will give power to a Minister to take administrative decisions or issue regulations to local authorities or other bodies. Equally, the Minister may take a decision himself, or a local authority may take a decision as a public body under the powers that it is given.

We do not have exactly that kind of system that you have. First, there is the law, and then within the law you may have routes that give the possibility for delegation of the powers, but delegation can be made from the Parliament to the national government, not the individual Ministers. We do not have that system. The law may give delegations to a specific state agency and it may give delegations also to individual local authorities, but it must be very clear.

We can see that in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Sweden</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> the Conservative Government has introduced a number of reforms with public choice reforms. For example, a question that I know you have introduced in the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> as well is a free school system. I think we included a picture about how it works in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Sweden</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. We have the centralised licensing of free schools by the school directorate, as I think it is called. The local authorities do not have a say in the establishment of our free schools but they have to pay, and they pay the average cost of a pupil in the local government schools, which could be very problematic from time to time because if there needs to be a new school built in the local government, that would ultimately raise the grants to the free school even though they have not done anything. This is a way of taking away a bit of our power, and also the possibility to plan education locally is getting very much more difficult when you have a system like this. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">There is also a choice system within healthcare. Healthcare is a national system but when it comes to care of the elderly, the local authority can choose whether to introduce this or not. This has taken away some powers of the local authority, and one might argue that it has given power to the individuals, but it makes it very much more difficult to plan and to manage local government activities. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q50 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Thank you.

We have had a very heated debate since at least the middle of the 1980s about the relationship between the state and the regions. The debate started when we had these county councils, who are responsible for healthcare services and public transportation, and during the 1980s there was a tendency in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> and in the European Union to strengthen the regions. The county councils and their associations started to argue that the county councils should have more powers given from the state administration in regional policy, transportation, planning, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">transport</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> planning and so on. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">What happened was that the Government and Parliament only created two regions, and that was the region around Gothenburg, which is the second biggest city, and Malmö, which is the third one, so there were regions </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">created.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> This has been another kind of issue but with a regional dimension, but we still have not changed our system very much because the local authorities also had a mistrust of these new </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">kind</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> of regions that were discussed. They were afraid that if you create these regions, the Parliament will not transfer power to those regions because they want to keep it in the state system. The local authorities were afraid that if you have these strong regions, directly elected, with taxation power, they would also begin to try to take over responsibilities, for example in secondary education, from the local authorities. This has been a very conflicting issue. Of course, it is not in the same character as you have with your nations, but there have been very strong tensions in the Swedish system between regions wanting more powers and local governments and national governments who were quite satisfied with the existing order of what I call the decentralised welfare state.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lars Andersson</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: One can say that right now this is at a standstill.

If they wish to make some sort of regional body to look after a particular thing, they should create it and pay for it themselves, so it would be a very bottom-up democracy. As you know, we had a rather belated experiment to look at regional government in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">England</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, which was very much top-down and very much after the devolution.

It was also meant to be dealing with a lot of the intermediary administrative arrangements in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Northern Ireland</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, because you had regional government even prior to devolution and democratic elections. When there was direct rule, Ministers from here were running regional departments of the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Northern Ireland</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> civil service. Local government had very limited powers and functions. We used to talk about the four Bs—bins, bogs, bodies and balls—being the responsibility of local government, but then there were these other intermediary bodies, particularly with health and social services and education, and they would have covered several local government areas. The idea was, now that we had democratic devolution, should we look at how we reorganise these? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Some 10 years later, that review of public administration has still not fully worked out, but we are moving from 26 councils to 11 councils, who are meant to be elected in shadow form this year. They are getting very few extra functions. Those extra functions that they are getting are not very clear, and whether or not they get resources to go along with the transfer of responsibilities is not very clear either, so you will have the whole issue about central grant versus own resources and so on. So it has been very limited. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">What people here talk about as </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Whitehall</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> keeping its grip, I have seen both as a Minister and just as a political practitioner in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Northern Ireland</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. It very much operates at regional government level as well. Civil servants tend to be very retentive. Departments are very jealous about “They know best, they understand these things and other people don’t.” That was true even when I was Finance Minister, even handling something like the second European peace and reconciliation package. The first package, which had happened before devolution, was very much delivered through what were called the intermediary funding bodies and also through locally-based partnerships, which were based in the local government areas but did not just involve local government. They involved other social partners. It was very successful. It was many people’s first experience of partnership work in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Northern Ireland</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, so it helped the peace process. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">When it came to us modelling the second peace programme, all the democratically-elected Ministers to whom I was bringing papers at the Executive as Finance Minister were saying, “Now that we have democratic institutions, we don’t need local delivery mechanisms and we don’t need the intermediary funding bodies. We know best.” They were all reading out of scripts provided by their own civil servants and their own departments. This included my own party colleagues. I was the one, as Finance Minister, bizarrely, who was trying to say, “No, we have to be doing this through local delivery. We have to be giving more to local government.”</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Even in the review of public administration, as Deputy First Minister, I had built into the terms of that the idea that it was not just to transfer fixed functions, but also to keep it fluid and to keep it open. In many ways, the models that are coming forward and the logic that is there for city deeds here and so on, we have regional capacity, but it is a case of then saying, “It might be in the same style as European programmes. We said there are things we want to do locally. Allow local government to bid—to say how they can do that best in their area, how they can design or shape a policy, and they can bid for their share of the funding accordingly. It does not have to be the same thing in every area, but it can be part of a regional governmental policy.” Again, the logic of that seemed to be accepted, but the civil service and just lazy regional political interests had decided, “No, we don’t want any of that.”</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> I am not going to ask our witnesses to comment on that or respond to that, but I would like to thank our guest witnesses, not least Mark Durkan and Bob Neill.
