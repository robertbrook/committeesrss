It found, “No significant change in relation to climate science or international and EU circumstances.” It concluded, “Based on the legislative criteria, there is no legal or economic basis for a change in the budget at this time.” I hope that in view of that very unequivocal conclusion and also, I am sure, your own thinking about the subject, you will agree that the only conclusion you can possibly reach is that you should keep the fourth carbon budget unchanged.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr Davey</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Chairman, you are asking me to prejudge the review that we are going to do in Government.

From what we have seen so far of the Climate Change Committee, its conclusions would not provide any legal basis on which to justify a change in the budget. Of course, the way in which the budgets are set and approved is the subject of a fair amount of law.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr Davey</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Absolutely. The review is a sensible process. We have cross-party agreement that the Climate Change Act architecture is something we will adhere to. Indeed, we have led the world with that legislation and I note the large number of countries that are now taking a legislative approach to create nationally—regardless of any international discussions—a legislative framework to help them and their Governments and their economies prepare both on mitigation and adaptation for climate change. The </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> should be proud of what we have and, because we have been a leader in this area, we should adhere to it. It would send a very, very bad signal if the UK, having been out in front, were relatively soon after passing that legislation to not adhere to it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q6 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> A further recent development reinforcing your view was the publication of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, which proposed the concept of a global carbon budget for which the fact that the UK is in the lead would be a further reason to be meticulous in our conclusions from any review that is taking place.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr Davey</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I could not agree more.

It would have very logical links to what we have done, as you said, and I thought </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment was a seminal moment in the debate on the scientific evidence. I am sure we will discuss it later on and there will be different views within your Committee, but from our perspective we think an objective and reasonable analysis of the scientific evidence they put forward suggests that action is as urgent as ever.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q7 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Without wanting to alarm the Minister of State, who has just arrived, I think I can say that the Secretary of State is managing very well without you so far.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr Davey</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: But it is nice to have him here.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I noticed a comment from Lord Stern the other day, who told us that quarrelling within the Coalition undermines confidence, “Government-induced policy risk is a serious obstacle to investment.” I think it is common ground between us that investment is very urgently needed in quite a number of aspects of the energy industry in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> at the moment. Would you agree that the decision, when you finally take it, on the fourth carbon budget will be an opportunity to give a strong policy signal that might be able to alleviate some of the crisis of investor confidence?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr Davey</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I do not accept there is a crisis in investor confidence. First of all, I think we should look at the track record of investment. We have had £35 billion of investment in electricity infrastructure, with £31.4 billion, I think, in renewables since 2010. This year, in addition, we have consented £20 billion of investment in low carbon, obviously with the lion’s share going for </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Hinkley</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Point</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">C</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, the first serious agreement for a new nuclear power station in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> for a generation. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Yesterday, I was delighted to be able to announce the front-end engineering and design agreements being signed with the White Rose Project for the CCS project in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Yorkshire</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. That is another step forward. Last week we had the FID enabling second phase announcement with a huge amount of renewables going forward to the go-early CfDs, representing 8 gigawatts if it all goes ahead of renewable energy in offshore, onshore, biomass and so on.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">With that background of investment, the story in energy—and I have not even mentioned the investment in oil and gas in the North Sea—is an extremely strong one, I would argue the strongest in any aspect of infrastructure that this Government has. Investors are putting their money where their mouth is and showing that the policy framework we are adapting is very strong and attractive.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Therefore, based on the evidence, you have to ask yourself why they are still so confident in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. The Energy Bill particularly, with the contracts for difference at the heart of it but also the capacity market, is providing them with a stable legal and financial framework. Yes, the Climate Change Act, the fourth carbon budget and so on can support that, but having a practical legal and financial framework embedded in the Energy Bill is the critical thing to get investors over the line. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Of course, I want to have a successful outcome to the review of the fourth carbon budget. I think that will assist, but I could point to the EU 2030 targets as being important. I could obviously talk about the UNFCCC agreements for 2015 being important. All these things give investors reassurance that not only the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> but the EU and the world are on an agreed pathway to tackle climate change, which will require the sorts of investments we are seeing.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think that there will be particular interest, however, in one of the things that you mentioned that is under the British Government’s complete control, which is the fourth carbon budget review. That is not a matter that has to be negotiated with EU partners or any wider international body. I should also remind you and the Committee about my interest in the Register of Members’ interests.

If I could move on to targets specifically, the Commission on Climate Change concluded in June this year in their progress report that there needs to be significant increase in the pace of greenhouse gas emission reduction starting very soon if the UK is to meet those statutory commitments. Considering we have only met the first carbon budget because of the recession, how confident are you that we can deliver and increase the pace of emissions reduction?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr Davey</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I am confident because the actions of the Coalition from day one have been to step up our practical actions in this area.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q9 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Albert Owen:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Can you give some examples?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr Davey</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Well, the Energy Bill I would say is at the heart of that because if we are going to make sure we have clean, secure energy at the most affordable cost we have to reform our electricity market. That is what the Energy Bill is about. The fact that we are already seeing a big increase in renewable electricity generation—nearly 16% already, well on the way for our target of 30% by 2020, and that is before some of the announcements that we have been making recently come on stream—suggests that we are getting to grips with the electricity side of the equation. We have work to do on the heat side and on the transport side, but we are seeing progress there. I would like it to go faster but we are seeing progress on both those fronts. Let me hand over to my Minister. Do you want to add any more to that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Albert Owen:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Good morning, Minister.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gregory Barker</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Good morning.

Although it is from modest beginnings, we now have over 5,000 installations for industrial and commercial applications. We have announced the rollout early next year of the domestic RHI and we are on track for that launch in spring. On heat, while there is a lot to do, we now have very solid foundations in place.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I would also point to the growing success of the Green Investment Bank, which is one of the Coalition’s most successful green stories—an enduring institution created by statute, now a very strong part of the architecture of the City of London. The impact that that has had this year in opening up the IPO market for renewable energy is very significant and a very good example of how strategic policy intervention using a relatively discrete amount of public sector funding can leverage an investment many times that from the private sector with a big policy impact.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q10 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Albert Owen:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Can I just refer back to what the Chair was asking about? There are some mixed messages. How do you square the move towards low carbon with shale gas? I think I have asked you this individually in the past, both here and considering targets. Do you see shale gas as a transition from coal to low carbon or do you see it in itself in the mix? If so, is that going to help us meet those targets?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr Davey</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes, I think shale gas has an important role to play. I am extremely keen to roll out shale gas exploration in this country and, hopefully, production. You will note that I asked my Chief Scientist, Professor David MacKay, to look at all the environmental aspects around shale gas in order to reassure people that the environmental issues that people are concerned about—whether it is water sustainability or the allegations that there could be toxic effects to the water table or, in particular, methane emissions—if you are properly regulated could all be dealt with. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">If you talk to some of the shale gas developers in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, who have learned lessons from the early years, they are now investing in what they call green completions for the shale gas extraction. I think shale gas, if done with proper regulation, can have a real benefit.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What Professor MacKay shows in his report is that, for the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, shale gas would probably be substituting for LNG coming from other parts of the world. The carbon footprint of domestically produced shale gas is less than the carbon footprint of LNG shipped from the other side of the world but obviously being tapped into by someone from the other side of the world. Therefore, it seems to me on the basis of the evidence that I have seen from my Chief Scientist that shale gas can make a contribution. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In terms of the electricity that can be generated, clearly if that is substituting for coal that is a massive step forward. One of the reasons why I was so delighted yesterday—and this is, of course, with the CCS coal project—to get real movement there is to show that whether it is coal or gas, if we can have CCS then both coal and gas have a role to play in a low carbon future.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q11 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Albert Owen:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Okay, thanks for that.

In that way, those types of pledges and their contributions can be assessed in a public way and analysed so we can see whether the combination of those would get us to where we need to be as a world.

The rules around MRV—measurement, reporting, verification—were also agreed. I refer to those as the building blocks—the foundation stones, if you like—of getting the treaty in 2015. If people were not going away and doing their work, if we had not done things on rainforests, if we had not done things on MRV, we would not be in a place where we could see that we will get to a negotiation in 2015.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There was quite a lot of progress.

They are, it is worth noting, still committed to a 2050 carbon reduction target, so they have not resiled away from the overall need, and indeed they were very generous with their international climate finance.

It has been interesting, has it not, that no one has been able to put the alleged remarks in inverted commas? No one has been able to prove that the Prime Minister said that. What you can prove is what the Prime Minister said most recently on climate change. I am going to quote him because these are in speech marks; this is on the record. When he was at CHOGM in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Colombo</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> he made what I thought was a very pertinent statement. He said, “If I said to you, ‘There is a 60% chance your house might burn down. You want to take out some insurance?’ you take out some insurance. I think we should think about climate change like that. Even if you’re less certain than the scientists, it makes sense to act both in terms of trying to prevent and mitigate.” He was absolutely clear that we need to act on climate change and when I have talked to him in private he is clear we need to act on climate change.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">John Robertson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Well, I seriously hope you are right and I hope and pray you are not proven in the future to be wrong.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr Davey</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Minister Barker reminds me that we recently had a presentation from the Government’s Chief Scientist on the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment.

Although Warsaw did not achieve any extra specific substantive measures—we particularly wanted action on HFCs; that was not achieved—what it did achieve was a real process on not just the Kyoto Protocol countries but everyone at that Durban platform coming together in June next year to look at pre-2020 mitigation. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That is quite important and maybe we have been underplaying the significance of it.

It is an interesting and robust approach, but in terms of where it practically takes policy, we have to be responsible for the carbon emissions that are emitted by individuals, households, communities and businesses in this country and try to minimise those. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We should work very effectively with other countries to try to help them reduce their emissions.

While I do not disagree with different ways of looking at the problem, I still want to make sure that when we are measuring carbon and how well we are doing in reducing it, we are doing it in a way that takes you to practical policies.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q37 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The CoP reduced the obligations of the developing countries from making “commitments” to making “contributions” to the reduction in emissions.

It will be etched on my mind forever, I think, because we were up for about 40 hours in that negotiation. We ended up in a huddle of about 100 people trying to decide whether we should use the words contributions, commitments, actions and targets. There were different formulations being put forward by different countries.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We, and I am clear about this, would have preferred the word “commitments”. The Americans—I think it was Todd Stern—originally proposed “contributions”. When we looked at that, we felt that was a compromise we were willing to get to because it did not take us back to a pre-Durban situation. There were some countries that wanted to re-insert the divide between developed and developing countries, which is in the Kyoto Protocol and the annexes. We wanted to avoid that at all costs because that would take us back to a pre-Durban position. The post-Durban position that all parties should make efforts is what we wanted to preserve. We achieved that even though we had to accept the word “contributions”, not “commitments”.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q38 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Back to my question, is it a step forward or a step back?

We wanted to go away from </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Warsaw</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> with all parties having to look at the contributions they are prepared to make.

That is quite significant. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">When you boil it down, what is the significance between commitments and contributions? There were countries, I think, who felt that the term “commitments” had some sort of legally binding nature to it within that word. Therefore, they did not want to have a legally binding commitment ahead of the treaty. They wanted what they were being asked to do ahead of the treaty to be a contribution, not a commitment. When we get to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Paris</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, clearly the legal status of these issues will need to be settled, but we were never going to settle the legal status issue in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Warsaw</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.

We did think long and hard about this because we had some sort of forewarning that this might be where the negotiation went down. Ultimately, while I would have preferred “commitments” because I do want to make more progress on that legal aspect, I did not think we would get there. Getting people to sign up to do the homework, to do the analysis, and that that applied to all parties—developed and developing—was the issue that we needed. That was the bottom line.

There are other countries that are going to see increasing emissions because they are so poor and inevitably with some development they are going to see emissions increase.

You have mentioned the question of insurance, but insurance itself presumably requires an insurer, and insurance requires contributions to insurance. How does this differ from compensation exactly? Would even those offset mechanisms be allied to some form of contribution, which does effectively indicate in what direction liability for those extreme events, for example, might be set at? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr Davey</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think we need to make some distinctions here. There are some people around the loss and damage debate who think that compensation linked to liability of countries around the world with some sort of historic responsibility means that certain countries—particularly the developed countries—should be putting their hands in their pockets now and in the future to compensate for loss and damage. That is not what was agreed at </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Warsaw</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. It is not part of the Warsaw International Mechanism. Clearly, it is not part of analysis that will flow from the Warsaw International Mechanism. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Part of the analysis though, I think, will involve things like insurance, which will not be a question of historical responsibilities and liabilities; it will be an insurance mechanism. The question is how can those be built and that will be what flows from the work. I cannot prejudge that and it is quite a technical area, but, as Pete was saying, there are some examples where you have some embryonic regional insurance mechanisms. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Let us say there is an island with 5,000 inhabitants and that island becomes uninhabitable. Clearly as a world we have to work out where to resettle these inhabitants; we are not just going to leave them to sink beneath the waves. That is a very critical issue; it shows you how challenging climate change is going to be. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="display:inline; font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none; text-transform:none; vertical-align:baseline">Q48 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Whitehead:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Things such as sea level rise and cyclones—indeed, yes, where a nation exists on a porous coral reef, the water by storm surges could render it unusable, for example, even if the island was not overwhelmed itself. That is, however, an event that just happens to that island and is not necessarily more extreme than weather events elsewhere. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">So how does the mechanism distinguish between what is an extreme weather event, which in any event there is still a lot of difficulty in attributing directly to climate change, and where that extreme weather event has taken place and its consequences for a particular community? I imagine a number of developed countries may well say, “There is an extreme weather event that has just occurred off our national coastline, but there is nothing for us there”, or would there be? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr Davey</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think what you are posing is exactly the right sort of question. There is a spectrum of problems that are going to come as a result of climate change—certainly, that is what the science is suggesting. You could say it is a spectrum of adaptation, with loss and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">damage being at the extreme end of that, but there being some pretty awful other events that are close to losing your whole island or losing where you live. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Maybe we could link that to the tragedy in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Philippines</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. We do not know whether or not that typhoon was caused by climate change. The scientists no doubt will look at that, certainly, I would not say that it was definitely caused by climate change. The fifth assessment report did suggest that later on in this century the frequency intensity of tropical storms may well increase as a result of climate change, but the science is not clear on that yet. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What the science does suggest made the tragedy in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Philippines</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> worse is the sea levels and the impact of storms has been made worse for certain lower lying islands and countries because sea levels are higher. I do not see that on the extreme that I was talking about with the islands, what it means is we have to take some potentially quite significant adaptation measures to protect people from the impact of weather events that may or may not be caused by climate change, but the combination of that with higher sea levels. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We know from the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’s very recent experience that flood defences can really protect people, their lives, their properties and their economic activity. The recent storm tidal surges we saw even last weekend, which had a big impact on a number of ports and towns and people, the initial evidence is that those impacts were dramatically reduced. People’s lives and homes were saved because of investment in flood defences. I am not saying that the tidal surge was caused by climate change—in fact I am pretty sure it was not, from the evidence I have seen—but taking adaptation measures, if you like, coastal defence measures can protect people very, very significantly. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It looks increasingly likely we are going to have to take a large number of those sorts of measures in a large number of places around the world, and I think we will need to do that under the Cancun Adaptation Framework generally. Some of that will be the sort of adaptation we have been talking about for some time. Some of it will be on the loss and damage end of the scale.

That scepticism is misplaced. There is increasing evidence that private sector finance is being deployed in greater numbers and that we are developing new financial policy instruments to work more effectively with private finance.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:21.8pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is in a particularly strong position to lead on this, for two very obvious reasons. Firstly, we are the only member of the G7 to meet its millennium development goals. We have genuine visible credibility with developing economies in terms of our public funding and no one doubts the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’s commitment; the Prime Minister’s restatement of that is very well understood.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:21.8pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Secondly, because of the expertise contained in the City of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, we have the private sector institutions and the individuals capable of creating these new products, leveraging on the back of public sector investment, the most effective direct investments into these developing economies. We are helped by two particular factors on top of that. One, in recent times, is the collapse in the cost of a number of renewable technologies—particularly solar, where the price has fallen dramatically and so is capable of being scaled up much more effectively and affordably.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:21.8pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The second, the change in investor attitudes towards developing economies, particularly beyond the usual suspects of, say, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">China</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, where there is obviously huge investment flows.

Investors are wanting to tap into new ways of accessing that forecast economic growth. A number of climate-related sectors are very attractive ways to do that. If we can create stable regulatory regimes and appropriate financial instruments to allow investors into clean energy, energy is something that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Africa</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> needs to expand.

I wanted to know what evidence it would take to make you less pessimistic about the potential impact of CO2 on the environment. If I may be specific, how long would we have to go with the current pause in the rising temperature of the surface of the globe before you thought that perhaps the world is less sensitive to CO2 than we had previously thought?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr Davey</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Given that you have implied that I am basically the Dr Pangloss of British politics, presumably you think unlikely the idea that I could be pessimistic about anything. Nevertheless, let me try to answer your question specifically. I am going by the science. I am not a scientist, but the people who work for the IPCC, the people who advise me who are scientists, provide the intellectual framework that we analyse and we have to then take decisions on.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That intellectual framework starts with the physics, physics that has been accepted for well over a century—namely, that certain gases that go up in the atmosphere can have a warming effect. That physics, as I understand it, is uncontested. There is the theory about how the thing works and then there is the question about, how much stuff is going up? We have a much better handle on that—not just in terms of volume, but the types of greenhouse gases there are and the impacts the different types of molecules, different types of gases, have on warming. That theory, in evidence now, is much greater.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Then you look at—following that science theory—what might happen to the world’s climate. What will the evidence be? When you listen to them, they talk about warming of land, warming of the oceans, ice caps and glaciers melting and sea levels rising. They talk about the acidity of the oceans, the impact on the climate generally and the potential increase in extreme weather events. Those are the sorts of evidence that would flow from that scientific framework. Then what we saw in the IPCC’s fifth assessment were measurements that scientists have taken on those different areas.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">You are talking about one of those, so let me engage with that one—the fact that the evidence so far is that, in the last decade, the temperatures measured on the land were not increasing at the rate that they thought they would. You described it as a pause. The IPPC fifth assessment describes it as a slowdown. They still note that the decade we are talking about had the highest temperature of any decade since 1850, so it was a slowdown but still with high temperatures, relatively speaking historically. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:21.8pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">They also say that people who isolate that particular period of time are not being very scientific because their model suggests that there will be times when global temperatures—as measured on the land—slow down and increase. They suggest that, to obtain a proper scientific analysis of this particular part of the evidence for climate change, one should take a longer period. That is a very long answer to your question, Mr Lilley.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It is very long, but it is not a</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">n</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> answer to my question.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr Davey</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I believe it is. What I am saying is that I go by the scientific evidence from the theory and the empirical evidence.

When I have seen the Met Office and talked to them—and we should be very proud of Britain’s Met Office; it is probably the world’s leading meteorological office—the evidence that they put forward and all the different indicators are that climate change is happening and is real, that we should take it seriously and that it has some very disturbing effects that require action.
