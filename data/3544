line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Given that the interest in unconventional gas exploitation is a relatively recent development in </span><span style="font-family:Arial;

font-size:11pt"> policies addressing the potential impacts arising, particularly of gas production or stimulation by fracturing.  That said, recent decisions have shown that sufficient policy guidance and clarity is available to robustly determine applications for exploratory wells.  This has been held to be the case with decisions taken at both the Local Planning Authority level, (in the case of the Vale of Glamorgan and Rhondda Cynon Taff) and by the Planning Inspectorate (in the case of the appeal decision on the previously refused planning permission for an exploratory well at the </span><span style="font-family:Arial;

font-size:11pt">Typically, development plans will include more generic policies which will seek to direct developers to locations appropriate for sustainable growth; protect minerals reserves; specify criteria which would identify new development to be acceptable in terms of its impact; preserve and enhance the natural environment  by protecting it against inappropriate development; protect the environment, public health and local amenity; support development proposals which promote the provision of renewable and non-renewable energy and promote high standards of design.  This list is by no means exhaustive, but reflects those key areas that the Local Planning Authority will need to asses when determining applications for shale gas exploitation.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt;

The Local Planning Authority then determined whether policies within the adopted Development Plan were out of date, or had been superseded by other material considerations.

line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Should such Welsh guidance be recommended to be produced, Planning Officers Society for Wales would actively assist in its development.  A sub-group of officers involved in minerals and waste planning within Wales already exists and works positively to improve the consistency of delivery of this complex and specialist area of work.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Following the publication of the DCLG guidance, they have since moved to address secondary legislation in respect of “</span><span style="font-family:Arial;

font-size:11pt">. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Appendix 2.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> In particular, DCLG propose changes to the notification of landowners prior to planning applications being submitted; the use of a standard planning application form for onshore oil and gas development and providing clarity on the calculation of the fee to accompany any planning application.  </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Consultation on those changes closed in mid October, but Welsh Government would be well advised to note the responses made by interested parties. In particular, concerns have been raised that proposals to reduce the need for notification of landowners prior to the submission of planning applications is a retrograde step at a time when an increase in pre-application discussions and their value is being advocated across the planning spectrum. The proposed changes seek to clarify the position on planning fees and this is a matter that Welsh Government should address.  The proposals on fee setting as set out in these revised requirements should not be replicated in Wales. The DCLG proposals clarify that the fee should be calculated on the area of the above ground workings only. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Experience from mineral planning authorities in England has shown that the resources to assess a planning application that involves </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">fracking</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> can be hugely draining on those authorities, so the planning fee should reflect that.  The planning application boundary (upon which the fee would be calculated) should include the area over which gas would be drawn extrapolated to the surface. That would result in a planning fee that is proportionate to the potential impact of the proposed development and the resource required from the local planning authority to assess it. The technical issues and consultation requirements for unconventional gas go far beyond that which fees normally cover and cater for in more conventional forms of development.  </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Applications for unconventional gas effectively constitute engineering and mining development and the fee schedule should reflect that.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Finally, whilst it is recommended that guidance should be provided for the assessment of unconventional gas exploitation in Wales, the technical expertise of the local planning authorities which will assess such applications is also worthy of consideration.  Mineral planning is a notable specialism within the planning system, one that in two-tier local government would be undertaken by the County Council, as the strategic planning authority.  In a single tier system this burden is placed on the unitary authority.  Experience in minerals planning is increasingly sparse and local planning authorities should continue to collaborate to establish resilient, experienced and knowledgeable teams to assess these complex applications.  Arrangements  are in place to provide these services in South West and North Wales, led by Carmarthenshire and Flintshire respectively. Other local planning authorities in Wales should ensure that they are adequately resourced to ensure that these applications are assessed in a robust, efficient and consistent manner. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Appendix 1- </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/224238/Planning_practice_guidance_for_onshore_oil_and_gas.pdf"><span style="color:#0000ff; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; text-decoration:underline">Planning practice guidance for onshore oil and gas – DCLG, July 2013.</span></a><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic"> </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Appendix 2</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">-</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/236945/Revised_requirements_relating_to_planning_applications_for_onshore_oil_and_gas_-_Proposals_for_comment__2_.pdf"><span style="color:#0000ff; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; text-decoration:underline">Revised requirements relating to planning applications for onshore oil and gas – DCLG, September 2013</span></a><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">November 2013</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:right"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">1</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
