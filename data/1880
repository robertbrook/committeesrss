We believe that the structures and organisation of Local Government procurement at a micro level have allowed individual councils to function and provide these everyday services sufficiently up until now. However, at a macro level, the dispersed and segregated nature of this structure has cultivated inefficiencies and dis-organisation within Local Government that are hindering its progression and viability.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Centralisation and collaboration are key elements</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> of any procurement function that seeks to gain best value; the leveraging of collective purchasing and combination of skills and expertise.

To what extent are local authorities able to develop long-term relationships with contractors?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Local Government faces a paradox between procurement and sustainability. Value for money imperatives and existing tendering processes, intended to promote </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">fairness in competition, mitigate in favour of larger suppliers who can benefit from economies of scale. Similarly, payment terms require credit availability that is usually only available to larger turnover supplying companies. On the other hand, local economic sustainability and growth objectives as well as social and environmental objectives are often, but not always, only available to smaller, locally based suppliers who cannot achieve economies of scale and whose tendered prices include the cost of credit (to cover cash flow and investment) which render their supply uncompetitive on paper but are often the most efficiently produced. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">A key lesson learned from the Oxygen solution is that, in addition, to the direct financial benefits achieved, the transformation in the relationship between the Local Authority and its supply chain brings huge mutual benefits. This is, in essence, because a fee based early payment scheme connects the supplier to the financial functions (treasury, accounts payable, finance) of the Council as well as the actual procuring department or decision maker. We are aware of similar benefits achieved where discount based early payment schemes have been implemented in Councils.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">We have little experience of the involvement of residents in delivering value for money excepting that the changed relationship with the supply chain, described above, harnesses the locally based SME supplying companies whose management and staff, as local residents themselves, contribute positively to the Councils' savings agenda, sometimes even when not directly in their companies interest. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; line-height:12.45pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7.5pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:9pt">2.

However, this is primarily because of the paucity of data on the actual and potential supply chain. The connectivity provided by our scheme, and the management data that flows from it, enables such collaboration in tendering and procurement.</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; line-height:12.45pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7.5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Whilst being supportive of central government initiatives to improve joint procurement, the fact is that without transparent and known financial incentives and rewards such as those provided by the Oxygen solution, such initiatives are not maximised to the benefit of the taxpayer.</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; line-height:12.45pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7.5pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:9pt">3. How can local authorities access the skills, expertise and capabilities to implement effective procurement strategies, including value for money and social and economic objectives?

Indeed our senior managers can credibly claim to have invented electronic payment. </span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; line-height:12.45pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7.5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Our experience is that Local Authorities cannot access the capacity to achieve these objectives because existing payment schemes do not provide the data or the </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">accessible knowledge of the supply chain required to do so. In metaphorical terms, our schemes provide the organizational equivalent of credit card statements as opposed to, at worst shoe boxes full of invoices and receipts to, at best, old computer systems that are too cumbersome to provide the data required. </span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; line-height:12.45pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7.5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">The understanding of the financial data, supply chains and comparative markets is simply not available to the right quality. Our work with our Local Authority clients is delivering such improvements and whilst we would ask the Committee to respect our intellectual property, we would, of course, be willing to give detailed evidence on this matter.</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; line-height:12.45pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7.5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:9pt">4. To what extent is risk in local government procurement and contracting understood and managed and contracting strategies adopted, which are tailored to product and supplier market places? More specifically, do local authorities maintain and operate effective client management functions and have they entered contractual arrangements which allow the flexibility to meet changing circumstances such as budget reductions or changes in the way a service has to be delivered?</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; line-height:12.45pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7.5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Our experience on this point is that risk understanding is widely varied across the sector and within individual Authorities. </span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; line-height:12.45pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7.5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Effective client management functions similarly vary enormously. However, connectivity with the supply chain can only be achieved, in our view, through a systematic and IT data based approach which requires an incentive to provide the quality of information required. This is why, we believe, a fee based early payment scheme is preferable to a discount or alternative scheme. Contract management requires information to be available in the financial and procuring departments as well as mutually beneficial relations.</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; line-height:12.45pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7.5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:9pt">5.

This effect is seen prominently in our private sector clients.</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; line-height:12.45pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7.5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:9pt">6. Is local authority procurement fully transparent, audited effectively and does it provide appropriate mechanisms for redress? Specifically, are the arrangements for securing the accountability of procured services and goods to local authorities and local residents adequate and effective? More specifically, to what extent are local authorities able to provide assurance to central government that value for money (in the broadest sense of the term) is delivered?</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; line-height:12.45pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7.5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; line-height:12.45pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7.5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">A fuller description of how our electronic payments systems enhance the data available to managers and elected Councillors is available from Oxygen and our partners, KPMG and ATOS.
