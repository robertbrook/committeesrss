I refer to the R.A.I.B report p22. In part 77, It states that the ORCC used the ALCRM system to assess this crossing.  The crossing was deemed to be a very high risk rated D3. It was concluded that the only way that risk could have been reduced at this crossing was to install red/green stop lights.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Part 81 states that The ORCC reviewed data collected at this crossing and increased the risk to a C2 due to increased speed of the trains.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Part 93 explains that despite concerns highlighted by the Mexico  footpath in Penzance in 2011 Network Rail continued to allow their trains to use the less audible single low tone horn.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Part 97 explains that after the crossing became part of the multi-user Timberland Trail the crossing was risk assessed again in 2009 and it was concluded that ‘consideration should be given to replacing the crossing with a bridge.  It further goes on to say that about two months before Phil’s death Network Rail had </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">accepted the need to replace</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold"> the crossing with a bridge.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">At the time of Phil’s death there was 6.7 seconds from the train coming into view around the bend and it going over the crossing and also the angle of the crossing meant that Phil and any other user would have their back to the train and the train would not have been in his peripheral vision.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">At the time of my brother’s death the crossing appeared bland and unimportant, covered with graffiti, but readable bland signage, overgrown vegetation, and a broken gate. Marc Green Phd has done much research into warning designs and he like Network Rail should be is an expert in the design of effective warnings. This is relevant to my brother’s death as he recognizes that human beings have inattentional blindness, distraction and tiredness and make poor judgments. He states that warnings should be a last resort after consideration has been given to the elimination of risk through system design and redesign and then putting in  guarding/protection mechanisms. Further he stated that often warning signs are only effective for legal reasons ‘to cover your ass’. Further if warning signs are used they should be vibrant, flashing or contrasting colours to grab the user’s attention. The sign at Kings Mill crossing did not show any of these qualities.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">So prior to my brother’s death Network Rail could have followed their own risk assessments and recommendations and worked within best practice using research available to them. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">If they had there would have been many changes:-</span></p><ol type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">There would have been a bridge.

Also the straightening of the crossing has reduced the traverse time and this would have saved Phil’s life as he only required a fraction of a second to get to safety.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">My brother was a hardworking, conscientious and loving man. He was mature and sensible and would not take his life lightly. He sought to protect himself and others.  He was displaying normal human behaviors on the day of his death. He was not breaking the law and was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">If this tragic and horrifying death can happen to Phil I believe that it could happen to anyone. Those who say that he risked his own life may believe that this somehow protects them, they believe that they would be more careful. However human nature is inherent and un predictable. Humans get distracted, pre-occupied and miss important information. Network Rail had the power to make this crossing safe but have been allowed to use cost and the amount of dangerous crossings that they are in charge of as excuses for doing nothing and in my opinion they fail to protect the trusting and sometimes naïve public. More importantly they failed to protect my brother who had so much more to offer.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The past cannot be changed but future lives can be saved and we would like a bridge at the Kings Mill site to protect the public, and to acknowledge that Network Rail made mistakes but more than this we hope that a bridge in Phil’s memory (maybe named after him) would mean that his death was not in vain and he truly has made a lasting mark on this world and this would mean so much to his family.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Yours sincerely,</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Tracy Hart</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt; text-align:center"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">QUESTIONS TO THE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><ol type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Why is it acceptable that Network Rail can admit to having many unsafe crossings but do not have to do anything about it would this be acceptable in the NHS for example?
