font-size:11pt">Providing evidence is essential if a complaint is to be made.  Whereas this stage of making a complaint falls outside considerations about complaints systems, the stage itself is a crucial part of a complaint.  However, obtaining that evidence is sometimes difficult if not impossible, despite individuals’ rights to it.  It also affects the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman’s effectiveness in handling complaints inadequately dealt with elsewhere.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial;

font-size:11pt">-use of Acts of Parliament, which are designed to allow individuals access.  This practice denies individuals any prospect of either corroborating or even making a complaint.  For example, there are insurmountable obstacles preventing relevant personal information being obtained by individuals despite the rights conferred by the Data Protection Act.  [Until guidance from the Department of Health changed, information sought by Executors via the Access to Health Records (of the Deceased) Act 1990 was unnecessarily difficult and in many cases impossible.]  Furthermore, by default, the obstacles are condoned by the Information Commissioner’s Office and by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial;

font-size:11pt">The Data Protection Act (DPA)1998, is meant to enable individuals to see personal information held on themselves:  it also confers the right for them to correct any factual inaccuracies in the records.  However, the Data Protection Act (DPA)1998 Subject Access Modification (Social Work) Order 2000, Statutory Instrument 2000, No. 415 remains open to different interpretation and consequently is easily </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">mis</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">-used. This Statutory Instrument states that personal data may sometimes be withheld, but only in circumstances where the disclosure would be likely to prejudice the carrying out of social work </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; text-decoration:underline">due to the serious physical or mental harm it would cause</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> either to the data subject or a third party.  There is no obligation for social workers to seek medical opinion despite the fact that they are not medically trained.  Councils and social workers can use this exemption with impunity.  They do not have to prove serious physical or mental harm – they can just state it.   The DPA also gives individuals the right to correct factual </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">inaccuracies in their records.  They cannot, however, correct any factual inaccuracies without seeing what has been proffered as facts at the outset. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Mis</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">-use of the Statutory Instrument results in gross injustices the length and breadth of the country, as well as preventing access to evidence to enable individuals to make complaints.  (See example 1 attached.)</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial;

font-size:11pt">When individuals complain to the Information Commissioner that personal information has been withheld, the default is to find in favour of the data processor (the body in jurisdiction) because the Information Commissioner states his office does not have the expertise to question social services.  ‘</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">The ICO does not have the expertise necessary ...’  </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">to ‘</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">...challenge the view or conclusions of a social work professional in terms of why they believe disclosure of certain information would cause harm.’*</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">  The public can only wonder why the Information Commissioner does not ‘buy in’ that expertise as necessary, and as recommended for NHS complaints in the Francis Report.  On complaining to the Parliamentary and Health Ombudsman a complainant will find that the Ombudsman supports the Information Commissioner because the Ombudsman “would not seem (it) appropriate for the ICO to challenge a professional opinion”.^  The public could be forgiven for concluding that no-one can question social services opinions.  The lack of necessary expertise to investigate and, where appropriate, challenge these opinions means that the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman cannot ever be effective in handling these sorts of complaints.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial;

font-size:11pt"> ‘collateral damage’, regardless of the lasting effect on them.   At the very least, the guidance and/or Statutory Instruments pertaining to the Data Protection Act need re-wording to prevent individuals being denied the means (a) to comment or complain about public services and (b) to prevent people from never discovering what is in the data being held on them or the opportunity to correct factual inaccuracies.  This would reduce considerably the complaints reaching the Information Commissioner’s Office and subsequently reaching the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, both of which ought to reduce costs.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial;

font-size:11pt">Differing interpretations of the Access to Health Records (of the Deceased) Act 1990 has also prevented key evidence being obtained to make a complaint about the care of a person who died.  Delays surrounding the various interpretations made it virtually impossible to bring a complaint to a hospital let alone to escalate it to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman.  (See example 2.)</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial;

font-size:11pt">The relationship between MPs and the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman ought to allow independence from each other while enabling co-ordination.  In some ways, MPs can be seen as giving advice about whether, how or when to complain.  There is merit in retaining the MP ‘filter’ because its removal could adversely affect complainants who may clearly need a kind of sponsor.  Removing the role could also reduce the ‘intelligence’ an MP has about serious issues some of her/his constituents face.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial;

The Act, Section 3 (1)(f) however, states that a deceased’s personal representative, namely her/his Executor, may have access or </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">someone with a claim against the estate</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> The Trust interpreted the subsection as only someone with a claim may have access, and that could include the Executor but only if he were making a claim arising out of the patient’s death.  The Executor was not making any claim.  After many months of correspondence, the Executor contacted the Chair of the Strategic Health Authority, who virtually dismissed the request for assistance on the grounds that the request was the business solely of the hospital in question.  The next year, the daughter wrote to her MP seeking help, who passed the letter to the then Minister for Health.  The Minister responded to confirm, unsurprisingly, what the Department of Health Guidance contained, namely that </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">either the Executor or someone with a claim can have access to the records, </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">and that they are not mutually exclusive</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">  The Hospital Trust in question refused the request again some six months later, citing advice from its own solicitor, claiming that the Department and the Minister had misunderstood the Act and attendant guidance.  A complaint was made to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman who did not proceed to an investigation because it was thought the matter was one of interpretation of the law and, therefore, ought to be dealt with in court.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; padding-left:4pt; padding-right:4pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; padding-left:4pt; padding-right:4pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">(iii)</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">In February 2010 the Department of Health’s new guidance on access to records of the deceased made very clear that the Executor of a will “</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">is the only person who has an unqualified right of access to a deceased person’s records and need give no reason for applying for access to a record.”</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> ^^   Five years had passed.  In November 2010, the Executor sent a copy of the guidance to the Hospital Trust.  It agreed to a further request from the Executor.  By that time the Trust had re-organised; there was a new Chief Executive and a new team dealing with complaints – and perhaps a new solicitor.  The consultant and the GP had retired.  The Trust considered it beyond its time limit to complain, and decided it had satisfied the long-standing complaint about the records.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; padding-left:4pt; padding-right:4pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; padding-left:4pt; padding-right:4pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; padding-left:4pt; padding-right:4pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; padding-left:4pt; padding-right:4pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; padding-left:4pt; padding-right:4pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt">^^ ‘</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt; font-style:italic">Guidance for access to health records requests’.  DH 2010</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; padding-bottom:1pt; padding-left:4pt; padding-right:4pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:8pt; font-style:italic">&#xa0;</span></p></div><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">November 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
