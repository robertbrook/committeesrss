In those circumstances, the unlawful actions of the local authorities in these case studies will, in future, go unchallenged.

They approached the local authority and sought to make a homeless application. They requested the immediate provision of temporary </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">accommodation pending the outcome of their homeless application.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The local authority refused to provide temporary accommodation and made a negative homeless decision. A review of that decision was requested and a further request for temporary accommodation</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> was made but refused. Our client and his girlfriend were becoming increasingly desperate. We sent the local authority a judicial review pre-action protocol letter advising them we would bring proceedings and</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">seek urgent interim relief if they did not prov</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">ide temporary accommodation. The authority’s reply, refusing our request, misapplied the law and was dismissive. It appeared that they had never been challenged like this before and had routinely dealt with homeless applicants in the same (unlawful) way fo</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">r many years. We issued judicial review proceedings including an urgent application for interim relief (i.e. an order that our client was provided with temporary accommodation). The High Court judge allowed our application for interim relief and the local </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">authority were forced to provide our client with accommodation. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Without our action and the judicial review proceedings, our vulnerable client and his partner would have remained on the street.  The matter was settled before permission was granted.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="2" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">We ha</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">ve recently assisted a family with an urgent homeless matter following rather horrific domestic violence, abuse and threats over a period of several years culminating in our client “escaping” her home.

Her children</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">had been traumatised by recent events following her being attacked and abused by the children’s father.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> She arrived in B</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">irmingham with a pushchair and 4 bags.

Initially th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">ey said they could not help her</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> despite her street homelessness. She persisted and was kept waiting for over 2 hours to even speak to a homele</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">ss officer. She was then kept waiting for a further 5 hours before being provided with one night only in a bed &amp; breakfast hotel(B&amp;B). The following day, she returned to their offices and was again kept waiting for several hours before being told that they</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> would provide one more night in a B&amp;B as a gesture of goodwill and would fund her return home even though she had fled home because of violence.  In summary, the law provides that she and her children should have been dealt with as a homeless household an</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">d provided with temporary accommodation until the local authority properly investigated her </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">homelessness. In this case, the local authority failed even to treat her as homeless or take a homeless application from her. She instructed us and, after our repre</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">sentations, they took a homeless application from her and then issued a negative decision on the same day. They refused to provide temporary accommodation. Subsequently, they refused to reconsider their position after we had written to them explaining that</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> they had used the wrong test, had otherwise completely misapplied the law and had made a series of factual errors. The local authority confirmed their decision refusing further assistance at around 5.30pm on a Friday evening, meaning that our client and h</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">er three children were street homeless for that weekend.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> We applied to the High Court for an injunction to force the local authority to provide temporary accommodation.
