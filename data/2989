As a minimum action, most authorities are much more proactive in their planning for managing salt stocks and re-stocking throughout the season. The strategic road networks have all acquired significant resilience salt stocks which would ease pressure on the readily available supply in the UK should prolonged, severe weather be experienced. This is important as it is difficult to significantly increase the amount of salt which can be purchased at short notice</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">1.4 There is also experience of reducing requirements for salting should it be necessary to conserve salt and most authorities will have processes to move to such arrangements quickly built in to winter service plans.

This demonstrates that the likelihood and impact of disruption to the network as a result of severe weather is fully understood. It does not mean that there has been no attempt to become more efficient as almost all authorities have looked at ways of providing the same or improved services for less by examining equipment, modern salting techniques such as pre-wetted salting and collaborating with others to make best use of resources.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">2.2 Some of the changes which have been made are:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 49.65pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 49.65pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-28.35pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">2.2.1 Investment in new equipment and enhanced spreading capability has taken place on strategic road networks.
