Wassenaar already contains controls on passive telecommunications interception equipment and specific items that are used to identify mobile phone details. However, this list needs to be urgently expanded. The surveillance industry is heavily based in developed economies with developed ICT sectors that are major arms exporters.

This particularly relates to products that fall within categories 5A002 and 5D002. Such controls are inappropriate. Cryptography is a key security measure to protect the confidentiality of communications, and to also ensure trust and confidence in digital interactions. Despite strict controls up until the 1990s, governments realised that in order to increase confidence in the then-emerging Internet economy, greater security was required. Encryption was becoming an essential safeguard for electronic commerce and global communications. The ready availability of strong cryptography (made available for use by human rights activists) over the Internet made export controls a competitive disadvantage for companies in controlled countries. To meet the interests of the US controls, the US National Security Agency worked with companies to introduce technologies that contained backdoors or reduced security obstacles for the NSA, which hindered US companies' abilities to sell their products to governments and companies overseas. As increased risks of surveillance by states and criminals increased, cryptography export controls became untenable and were eventually liberalised. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Times; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="14" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Times; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Times; font-size:12pt">The depth in detail reported on exports of cryptographic equipment is not sufficient to make a reliable judgment on what the product being exported actually is. 5A002a1a can, for example, include a wide range of products employing cryptography to secure communication in addition to extremely pervasive surveillance systems.

However, the same equipment can also be used to monitor packets of data for surveillance purposes and for censoring particular websites and services from general access.
