They have proven to be just as relevant in a world where there are hundreds of media outlets as they were in the old days of monopoly.  A combination of a stable mission and a licence to innovate has made the BBC a catalyst for the growth and success of the UK media market – introducing people to digital services; investing in independent producers; spreading its footprint outside London; building our reputation in overseas markets.</span></li><li style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt; line-height:14pt; margin:7pt 0pt 12pt 14.33pt; padding-left:14.02pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">The future development of media markets will be global, fuelled by a digital revolution that does not respect national boundaries.

BBC Online is smaller and more focussed on the BBC’s public service mission while Radio 1 and Radio 2 are more clearly distinctive in the competitive radio market than previously.

It will issue framework documents that state the boundaries for relevant areas of BBC activity not covered by the existing service licences – including its commercial businesses and distribution activity. It will ask the public, as shareholders, to help set the priorities for the BBC each year, and they will also be able to watch the Trust at work scrutinising the performance of the BBC in a number of meetings streamed live on the internet. At the same time, the Trust will not become involved with the Executive’s managerial decision-making or its development of detailed plans and strategies.

The Executive Board will be strengthened by the appointment – with Trust approval – of additional experienced non-executive directors, as provided for in the Charter, with an increase in numbers from four to six. The Director-General will also radically improve the way the BBC’s decision-making structure works, removing unnecessary boards and committees throughout the organisation. Together these measures will provide better decision-making and clearer accountability throughout the BBC for important projects and investments. The Executive Board will be able to manage the organisation better, with stronger external input from its non-executives.  Both the Executive Board and Trust will be able to monitor BBC performance more effectively and to identify risks and problems at an earlier stage.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">December 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="line-height:14pt; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="line-height:14pt; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div><hr style="width:33%; height:1px; text-align:left" /><p style="line-height:14pt; margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn1"></a><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:8pt"> Source: BBC Annual Report and Accounts 2012-13</span></p><p style="line-height:14pt; margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn2"></a><a href="#_ftnref2">[2]</a><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:8pt"> Source: BBC Annual Report and Accounts 2012-13</span></p><p style="line-height:14pt; margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn3"></a><a href="#_ftnref3">[3]</a><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:8pt"> Source: BBC Trust Purpose Remit Survey 2012-13</span></p><p style="line-height:14pt; margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn4"></a><a href="#_ftnref4">[4]</a><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:8pt"> Source: BBC Pulse Survey</span></p><p style="line-height:14pt; margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn5"></a><a href="#_ftnref5">[5]</a><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:8pt"> Source: BBC </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:8pt">Accountabilty</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:8pt"> and Reputation Tracker</span></p><p style="line-height:14pt; margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn6"></a><a href="#_ftnref6">[6]</a><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:8pt"> Source: BBC Competitive Brand Tracker</span></p></body></html>
