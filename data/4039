The BBC is one of the most significant employers of Equity members and it has an integral role as a producer and commissioner of original UK programming providing content for audiences in a wide range of genres including drama, comedy, factual and entertainment.  It also plays an important role in supporting the creative industries, as a key provider of education and training. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="2" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.11pt; padding-left:3.89pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Any review of the BBC, particularly in the lead up to the end of the current Charter period should strongly focus on public value and public service. In Equity’s view, it is imperative for the Committee to acknowledge and support the breadth and diversity of the BBC’s output across television, radio and digital services and must balance the concerns of commercial media rivals against the needs of audiences, and especially niche audiences, who greatly value the range of services provided by the Corporation. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">BBC </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Licence Fee</span></p><ol start="3" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.11pt; padding-left:3.89pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">As a world, national and regional broadcaster, the BBC showcases the UK to the rest of the world, plays a crucial role in our economy, both as an employer and an exporter of goods and acts as a standard bearer for the audio-visual sector in terms of quality, diversity, and innovation. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="4" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.11pt; padding-left:3.89pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">This is only possible because the BBC is supported by unique sources of funding, including the licence fee and its commercial operations.

The licence fee provides excellent value for money for licence fee payers and audiences. The cost of an annual licence fee has gone up by just £10 since 2007. It now costs just over £12 a month for all the TV, radio, website and live events the BBC covers. This compares to more than £60 a month for some subscription services. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="5" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.11pt; padding-left:3.89pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The Federation of Entertainment Unions (which includes Equity, BECTU, NUJ, the Musicians Union, Unite, the Writers Guild of Great Britain and the Professional Footballers Association) has been campaigning since 2010 for a revision of the licence fee settlement which effectively imposed a cut of 20% on the BBC.

This has been most notable when observing location choices, the use of fewer supporting artists and other elements such as animals and period items such as carriages in crowd, street and battle scenes in costume dramas. Funding cuts have also led to a decline in the use of large set piece stunts and less money being spent on script editing. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="12" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">These measures represent a false economy because well scripted and properly funded high quality drama productions can be sold and exported around the world, generating additional income that could be ploughed back into commissioning new dramas with bigger and better budgets, production values and scripting creating a virtuous circle of production investment.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="13" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The additional funding responsibilities placed on the BBC including the World Service – costing £272m and BBC Monitoring – costing £27m per year, both of which were previously directly by Government, should be reversed and the money ploughed back into core output including drama.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="14" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">It is regrettable that in many cases BBC senior management pay levels continue to appear to reflect patterns elsewhere in the economy, namely a growing gap between a small number of highly paid executives, whose rewards have grown year on year irrespective of performance or the overall state of the economy, and the rest of the workforce who have seen greater insecurity and lower rewards. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="15" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Conversely, and contrary to public perceptions, payments to most performers working for the BBC have been in decline for some years. The BBC introduced capping and banding of fees for regular and guest actors (excluding top talent) in 2006 across a range of continuous and non-continuous dramas and since then the BBC have refused to review/increase these fees. Consequently, in real terms, mid-range actors are suffering pay cuts year on year. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="16" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Putting payments to performers in a wider context, according to the BBC’s Financial Statement 2012/2013 the BBC’s total income is over £5bn and the BBC’s spend on artists for 2012 was £31.2m - less than 1% of the BBC’s total income.  Expenditure on artists has decreased in the period 2010 to 2012 from £37.5 to £31.2m.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="17" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">If the BBC is to continue to attract the best talent for its productions it must retain and improve terms and conditions and pay levels agreed with Equity and other trade unions for all performers. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="18" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Finally, there are concerns that cuts have been having an effect on the impact of the BBC’s work to address equality and diversity, particularly in its ability to recruit staff and crew from a range of backgrounds. Budget cuts could also threaten stand alone projects aimed at performers. Equity has recently been working with the BBC and other broadcasters on initiatives including casting days for disabled performers. Good work such as this could be jeopardised by any further cuts to the BBC.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Production and work opportunities in the Nations and Regions</span></p><ol start="19" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Through the Broadcasting in the Nations campaign Equity has been calling on broadcasters to produce more content in the Nations and Regions in order to draw on the skills and talents in these areas.

The aims of the campaign are to encourage broadcasters to undertake more local casting and, relevant to the remit of this Inquiry - to encourage Ofcom to consult with stakeholders about an appropriate inclusion of on-screen talent in its definition of an Out of London production. Ofcom also has a role in ensuring that Channel 3 and Channel 5 licence holders fulfil their obligations with regard to non news programming.
