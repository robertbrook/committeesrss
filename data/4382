font-size:12pt">Department </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">and was given PIP, and I looked very carefully at the documentation in front of me, there were expectations of a brand-new benefit with so many face-to-face assessments</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">we are nowhere near what we would have expected to be on.  That is probably a dangerous thing to say before a Committee that is being published, because everyone will go out there and think, “Well, should we or shouldn’t we?” but the key on this is that we get the decisions right.  We have some figures, although it is very early days on PIP, that it is nowhere near what we would expect on appeal or going to tribunal.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jason Feeney</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The Ministry of Justice are publishing their figures on appeals up to, I think, 28 September tomorrow.  That is my understanding.  They, of course, hold the figures on appeals, because appeals for PIP are directly lodged under appeals reform with the Ministry of Justice.  Certainly, we have made decisions, as I said, on 30,000 claimants.  15,000 of those people have been told that they are not entitled to PIP, and we have had very small numbers of appeals and, actually, smaller numbers of reconsiderations than we expected.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That is because we have put a huge amount of time and effort into the design of PIP.  Learning the lessons from Harrington and others means making sure that we get as much evidence as we can up front in the claim process, so that we get all the information needed for the assessment providers to get the quality of decision that we need.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

they have had a face-to-face assessment; they have been encouraged throughout the process to provide the evidence; and they have had a clear explanation as to why the decision that has been reached has been reached, and we have put time, effort and money into supporting that.  That is what is driving the low levels of recons and appeals that we are seeing.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jason Feeney</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There are three points.  The second point is that claimants are taking longer to return the claim forms.  Once they have made the initial registration over the phone, which is capturing basic information, then they are sent a claim form that is “How your disability affects you”, and, as I said earlier, a lot of that focuses on making sure they have a mix of tick-box areas and free-text areas.  There is strong encouragement for the claimant at that point to provide any medical evidence they have available to them, and claimants are taking longer.  You have got four weeks to return that form; they are taking longer than four weeks to return that form, on average, so that is building in time delay.  The last area that is building in the delay is that it is taking longer for our assessment providers to undertake the assessment, book the appointment, go through the assessment process, have that through their audit process, and then back to my decision-makers to make the final decision.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt"> there are no healthcare professionals who have actually had experience of undertaking this assessment.  Indeed, that has other implications, because it also means that there are no healthcare professionals who have got the experience to actually check and audit the quality of what is happening.  The initial phase of new assessments was always going to take longer than we expected once it got to a steady state where people have got the experience.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">One of the challenges, of course, is that the early stage is actually the most important stage in making sure that people actually are undertaking the assessment correctly, applying the criteria correctly and consistently, and reaching carefully considered recommendations for the case manager.  Feedback is, obviously, important in that.  That is one of the things that inevitably, to begin with, has caused some delay, because it is taking time.  There are always going to be more cases that need feedback to the healthcare professional, that need amending, and that will gradually improve.  One of the interesting things that has actually contributed to some of the total assessment part</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">so actually reviewing the information that has been provided by the claimant, doing the assessment, then producing the report</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mike Penning</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We accept that.  For instance, as Jason was saying, the rule is four weeks.  Now, we could be rigid on the four weeks and say that, after four weeks, the claim lapses, because it actually sits on the system to show us that we are still in a process, and that is where some of the delay may sit.  We do not do that, not least because people have individual circumstances</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">particularly people with mental health issues, and there may be really good reasons for other people, such as being in the hospital.  What we are looking at is to now extend that</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt"> I was first.  I obviously have some constituency experience of Capita assessments; they are the assessor for my area.  The complaints that keep being raised are that, one, that it is quite hard to get an assessment booked, and then when you do, they get cancelled at the last minute and you cannot get another one booked.  It is certainly our experience that it is extremely hard to get any information out of Capita about what is going on and when they can fix these problems.  What is the understanding you have from the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Department </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">about how some of these contractors are actually performing?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mike Penning</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The problem at the moment, to do with the commentary as a constituency MP, is that it is quite anecdotal.  You hear things and you hear things, but what we are doing is pulling in the analysis, and one of the questions I have been asking is, “How many people have had their appointments cancelled?  How quick were some of these appointments?”  Of course, some people are requesting to tape their appointment</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—and they are entitled to do so—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">on recording equipment, so that sometimes is affecting how long a consultation takes place.  Of course, the other criterion that we are very much looking at is the distance criterion, as to people coming in and whether they are capable of coming in, and then the home visit.  That area is </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">one </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">that I am particularly looking at, again, at the moment.  We will have the data.  It is fairly early, but we will have the data.  Actually, to be fair, the more that constituents let individual MPs know and let us know, that helps as well, because that gives me comparison.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt">—as we developed the assessment—made some assumptions about</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> how long things might take on average, but the reality is that what we want is to ensure that the assessments are done as efficiently as possible but, most importantly, that they are done properly and to the right standard.  Obviously, because we are in a relatively early stage, we are starting to gather evidence about how long things take.  We will be looking at that in due course, but we know</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">and we have experience from other assessments</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Once you become familiar with what you are doing, things become quicker.  If I go to a very different assessment, the WCA, when Professor Harrington recommended introducing the Personalised Summary Statement for the healthcare professional at the end of the assessment report, that increased the time of the assessment initially by quite a lot, because it was something new.  It took healthcare professionals time to get used to doing that, and then we saw, gradually, things coming down.  We got more or less back to where we had been before.  There are things that will settle down as healthcare professionals get better at it, and the same with the auditing process, because at the moment it takes auditors longer: they are still inexperienced at auditing, and therefore doing it properly will take time.  We know that as auditors get more experienced, things speed up as well.  Those will speed up, but there is no </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">target that providers have to meet in terms of the actual assessment duration, because it is important that they do the job properly.  Clearly, the assessment duration has an impact on how many people can be done in a session, and so on.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

what is your evidence to support that?  How can we make sure it is reliable?”  Park that one there.  You said 12 to 15 weeks was the original time; what is it now, and what is the biggest block?  What is the biggest delay, compared with what you thought?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-weight:bold">Gunnyeon</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Perhaps I can help clarify.  The point you need to remember is the fact that this is a new assessment process.  Providers, inevitably, made assumptions on how long it might take for healthcare professionals to get up to speed, for auditors to get up to speed; and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">how many would be needed.  Now, it is always difficult when you have not done something like this before, and what inevitably happens is that once you start delivering, you learn, and then you have to adjust things.  I think the providers have been doing that: they have increased the number of auditors, having recognised that the auditing process was more challenging than they had perhaps anticipated.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">As has been mentioned, there are two different delivery models, which we were very keen to see.  Capita’s is more an in-house, and with a significant home assessment component; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Atos</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> are using a supply chain.  Both have attractions, and we will be able to learn from this.  I think </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Atos</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, for example, have perhaps realised that, initially, the supply chain model</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">when you are trying to get new healthcare professionals up to speed and you are trying to audit and provide feedback</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—does actually</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> make it more time consuming than perhaps had been anticipated.  Coming back to what Mr Mills said earlier, we have been working very closely with both providers.  There are weekly meetings with the providers to review issues and so on, and there is a huge amount of work being done in partnership and by providers to quickly learn the lessons and improve.  I do not think it is a capacity issue overall.  I think it is an issue where there has probably been an underestimation at the beginning of how challenging the process of establishing a new assessment and delivering it was.  That is actually being addressed now, and things will without a doubt improve.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

we are in very early stages in terms of rolling out the scale of this change.  This is the biggest change we have had in the disability benefits space for 20 years.  Inevitably, in the first three, four or five months there is going to be an issue of people bedding in to the process, whether it is healthcare professionals or whether it is issues about handling enquiries from claimants.  I do think that we are seeing a continuous improvement of that.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt"> the medical profession.  They are being asked to look at different things, so it is not just a question about what your illness is; it is about your capability and capacity, which is different.  There is an issue, however, about the evidence gathering and then how that evidence is interpreted.  Clearly that plays a part in the whole delay process.  To what extent is there clarity about what evidence can be accepted, who can take responsibility for collecting it and who will pay for it?  Certainly, within my own constituency, there are concerns among GPs, who have absolutely no idea what they can do, when they can do it, and they still do not seem to understand this concept of capacity/capability as opposed to physical illness.  When someone comes in and says, “Please can you write me a letter?” they get the wrong sort of letter.  There is all of that piece, and I do not know how you are resolving that.  Then clearly, there are the assessors themselves trying to look at all these bits of paper that do not necessarily answer the questions that they really need to have answered.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">meet the BMA in the very near future to talk about two areas: one, making sure in the paper terminology they get enough information that they know what they need to put on the form.  I hope, interestingly enough, to get away from forms with GPs as well.  This is one of my passions.  If you go to see your GP, he or she does everything on her screen at the moment, from the prescription right the way through to asking you questions that you do not know why they are asking—there is a box on their screen saying, “Tick this.  You will get paid a bit more money.”  That is what happens.  I want a box on their screen they can hit; once we send them the PDF, they can fill it in and that comes back.  Without being rude to GPs, it is idiot-proof as to what they have to put on there.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We have to work with the BMA and we have to work with other medical professionals to make sure that we get in the information that we need as early as possible.  As I alluded to earlier on, one of the big frustrations for us is that evidence comes in right at the last minute.  It is often on the day of tribunal.  We have never seen it and quite rightly we lose the tribunal because it is based on the evidence, but we have not seen that evidence.  On the technical side of it, I will ask my Chief Medical Adviser to talk about it.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-weight:bold">Gunnyeon</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Clearly, in PIP we have made some changes and, as I said earlier, we are getting more information at the start when the individual returns the form.  What is important then is that the healthcare professional assesses that and determines whether in fact they have enough evidence to make a decision.  Clearly, if they have, it saves a face-to-face assessment where there is enough evidence.  If there is not, the opportunity is for them to consider at that point whether they want to seek further evidence or not.  Again, we ask claimants to indicate who the best person to seek any further information from is, because it might not always be the GP.  It might be their cancer specialist; it may be a community mental health nurse or whatever.  We ask that.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The important thing is that, when we seek that evidence, what we are seeking is first and foremost factual evidence—that we ask the right questions of the healthcare professional that we are seeking the evidence from.  That is one of the problems we have had, and we have done quite a lot of work looking at this in relation to other assessments.  It is making sure that we ask properly targeted questions so we get the evidence that we need.  The Minister has highlighted one of the challenges is how we can make this as efficient a process as possible and how we can do it in a way that GPs and other healthcare professionals can fill out easily, so that there is a good chance that we will then get it back quickly so all the evidence is available and it does not delay the assessments available at the time of the assessment.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

we are in the 90s, and the reason for that is we just do not have enough information to say “Okay, we’ve looked at what the situation in your personal case is.  We accept your position because of the evidence base for it and we do not need to bring you in for a face-to-face assessment.”  I think we will be better at that if we can do what we have just alluded to, which is actually get more information in as early as possible.  Of course, that will take the pressure off, because that is talking about 15% or 16% of people that are coming for face-to-face assessments that we think probably do not need to.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

they just did not understand what we were asking.  That was in the written-based version of that.  Then the system will accept that very often, and then the system will say, “No, that’s clearly not a nationality,” and then people have to go back and make phone calls.  It is getting the information as early as possible correct, so that we can then move that down through the system.  That is where the quality assurance is crucial, which is why I and the Committee complained about how long it takes.  Quite rightly, Bill is saying to me, “Mike, I’ve got to get it right,” because otherwise we are not there.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Clearly, those people who are terminally ill are a group of people that we are all very concerned to ensure get sensibly and sensitively supported.  Macmillan and, indeed, others—we have had something in from Parkinson’s as well—have really come up with some fairly unhappy statistics.  They say that the research they have undertaken results in evidence that 26% of people with cancer die before they receive payments.  They have raised concerns about these individuals worrying, therefore, with regard to debt issues.  These are just the sorts of things you do not want people who are terminally ill to have to worry about.  With that backdrop, clearly the question from the Committee to you is: what exactly is the process that you follow for PIP claimants in this particular circumstance?  How does that differ from DLA?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mike Penning</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Let me just quickly say that I am ever so conscious about that.  I have had constituents in a similar situation before I became the Minister, and subsequently since.  We have to get it right, because these people need the help as fast as they possibly can.  I have met with Macmillan and we have agreed to work together.  I am happy to work with any organisation that works with these people who are in such a difficult time in their lives and for their families and loved ones.  I will ask Jason to do the more technical stuff, but I alluded </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">to one of that areas that Macmillan said to me was delaying and making things take longer.  It was the fact that we had gone to a phone system rather than a paper-based system</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, because, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">  </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">p</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">articularly for them trying to help their patients, this was causing more delay to them when they were visiting.  In other words, they would just sit there usually and fill out the form; we accept Macmillan’s diagnosis and professional comments.  That would go and then that was basically where the system was.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The key now is there is a phone conversation that takes place that, understandably, Macmillan does not want to be involved in because that holds their nurses in there too long.  Then the DS1500 comes out, which we accept Macmillan or other professionals that are looking after the individual can sign and we are very happy with that, and then it goes back in.  Once it is back in, that is very quick.  It is that piece that we need to squeeze, and that is why I am looking at whether there are other ways we can do it.  I think it is just as quick to fill a form in as it would be to have a PDF sitting on your iPad and hit a button; it goes back in.  It could have the DS1500 on there already if it is a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">SecureNet</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> 2.0, for instance</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, or whatever else it may be. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Jason will explain the exact process.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jason Feeney</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I will try to keep it brief, because I know there are other questions to come in.  When we looked at PIP in terms of the design, we looked at where we were on DLA.  Very briefly, on DLA you had fill in a form and you had to get the DS1500 form, which is a confirmation of the diagnosis.  Then at that point you put that in and then your claim started when we received that as a Department—when the form would have been filled in and posted, and everything else.  We said, “How can we make that a better process and a quicker process?”  One of the reasons we moved to the design we have for especially those terminally ill claimants for PIP is that it secures the date of claim earlier, so people will get paid the money from an earlier date than they would otherwise have done because it starts from the point at which you contact us.  There is also no form-filling to go through.  I know Macmillan has an issue with this, but for the majority of claimants there is no form filling and we capture the information on the phone.  Perhaps colleagues have been in this area for some time; we had lots of concerns previously about the nature of the DLA claim form, so we wanted to take the claim form out of the process for terminally ill claimants.  They do not have to go through a face-to-face assessment either.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The whole purpose of the design is to give a really quick, fast track process.  As the operational director for delivering PIP, I would absolutely say that the service that we gave for some terminally ill claimants at the beginning of PIP was not up to standard.  It certainly was not where we would be expecting it to be.  I am not going to try to pretend otherwise.  There were some awful experiences that people went through.  There are complexities around that: people are not always immediately diagnosed as terminally ill, they become terminally ill and things like that.  Nevertheless, the service was not where we would want it to be.  There is nobody more committed than our staff to delivering that fast track service.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We have made a number of changes to the process since we have introduced it.  One of the things we have done is we now have dedicated teams in each of our centres.  I have a dedicated team to the terminally ill claims.  We have introduced improvements to the tracking process so that we can track those claims not only when they are with us, but when they are with the assessment provider as well.  One of the big improvements I think we will see is when we increasingly roll out the IT tool that the providers are using: the PIP assessment tool.  We have had examples in the last few weeks now where we have sent the claim over to the assessment provider; they have looked at the evidence that has been provided and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">returned it to us within a day.  We are beginning to see that coming down.  Most are being dealt with now within 16 days.  We have had roughly 8,000 terminally ill claims and we have cleared 7,000 of them.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I would not deny that there were issues earlier on.  I think we are addressing those.  There are further changes we could make going forward: we are looking and exploring at the moment about whether you have a dedicated, separate telephone line or a dedicated telephone number for terminally ill claims as well.  I would not deny that there have been issues.  We have introduced a number of changes that have seen us improve our performance over recent weeks and there is still more we can do.  The Minister is absolutely right that, if we can get the electronic transfer or speed up the transfer of the confirmation of the terminally ill diagnosis, that will be the single biggest thing that moves us forward in terms of elapsed time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

it was only those with physical impairments.  The whole mobility area when we developed the assessment was designed to try to ensure that we properly reflected both.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">When it comes to the physical side of things, there is no gold standard way of assessing.  The assessment development group as we were developing the assessment spent a lot of time looking at this.  We looked at different ways of doing it.  There was not anything that was perfect.  In the second draft of the criteria, we tried to do something that reflected aids and adaptations that was designed to have the same policy intent as in fact the subsequent 20</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">metres and 50 metres does.  It was very clear to us as a result of the response to the second draft of the criteria that it was not clear at all to people and, in fact, it was confusing.  As a consequence of that consultation—I do want to emphasise again we looked very </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">carefully at that—we made a lot of changes to the second draft criteria.  The one that clearly caused lots of confusion was Activity 12, which is moving around.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We looked again at that, and in order to try to identify those who faced the greatest challenge in moving around, we felt that, within those who could walk not more than 50</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">: Obviously, I am conscious of time.  Clearly, when we identified a quality issue, the improvement plan that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Atos</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> put in place involved some retraining and then re-accreditation of all their healthcare professionals.  They have gone through that and that has been quite a big exercise, but I think an incredibly important one.  A lot of healthcare professionals have left the business either by deciding they did not wish to try to re-accredit or they did not meet the standards.  I think now we are in a very much better position and the quality of WCA assessments is very much better than it was.  We have looked very recently again not just at monitoring the quality, but actually looking at a sample of the cases, and they are very different now.  They are much better.  I am confident that now the quality is getting back to pretty much where we would have always wanted it to be.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mike Penning</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Certainly, from the conversations I have had at board level with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Atos</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—because we have taken it to a level where they had to really realise just how bad this was for their reputation in the UK, with other contracts in other Departments as well—they do get it that they have to step up to the plate and provide.  We are not mucking about here; this is really serious stuff.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-weight:bold">Gunnyeon</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I understand that entirely.  If I could just, in my defence, say that I have been absolutely clear on what I believe the situation is.  That is very recent, though.  Remember that the problems were identified last year.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Debbie Abrahams:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> But they are still saying there are problems.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-weight:bold">Gunnyeon</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The improvement plan was not put in place until June.  In fact, there was a real challenge because it took a considerable amount of time for all healthcare professionals to be re-accredited.  That was not finished and there are still some moving through it who were off on maternity leave or on sickness absence at the time.  That was not completed until early October, so unless that evidence is based on the past six or eight weeks, I would not have expected that there would necessarily not still have been problems identified.  Clearly, I am concerned by any feedback, but I think if we were looking at that report this time next year that had been done in the year from now forwards, I would hope it would be very different.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;
