These changes fundamentally misunderstand the role of the Unit Director, which is the effective running of a world class, but locally rooted, health protection team. This places limitations of scale on the size of the team, since it is hard to provide effective professional leadership of the type currently provided by the Unit Directors to a large and geographically diverse team. It also has implications for the size of the area covered, since much of the current role is based on the Unit Directors’ relationships with those external to PHE, especially DPHs and the NHS. Despite this, PHE is consulting on changes which would mean that there would effectively only be one Unit Director per PHE Regional Centre, whose job title would change to Deputy Director of Health Protection. Currently, due to the disparity in geographical and population size between PHE’s regional Centres, the number of HPUs in each Centre ranges from one to four. Any amalgamation of Unit Directors into a smaller group with responsibility for a larger area would create a vacuum of both team leadership and local engagement. The PHE consultation makes no reference to how this vacuum could be filled.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">PHE and developing the specialist workforce </span></p><ol start="8" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14pt; padding-left:4pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">We believe that the multidisciplinary nature of specialist public health is one of the strengths of public health in England.
