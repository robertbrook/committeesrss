My work was principally to gather the views of participants in this field, within the Data Strategy Board, medical, academic, technological, business, Whitehall and political communities, as well as seeking input and testing conclusions with surveys to the general public and to a 'data-engaged' panel. When the Review was published it received broad approval from these communities. I say this is not because I claim any expertise myself but simply because I saw my job as bringing together the views of many experts. The conclusions of the Review were broadly accepted by the Government.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">I wish here to focus on four points: to distinguish between the accountability and economic advantages of open data; to outline what government should see as its role in building the necessary infrastructure; to suggest that the full economic potential can only be exploited if we move with greater urgency; and to argue that we need to be less nervous about privacy issues if we want to get the most out of the opportunities ahead.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The Data Strategy Board was jointly created by the Cabinet Office and BIS. As its Chairman I was asked to conduct a Review of our strategy for public sector information looking at it particularly from the point of view of the potential for driving economic growth as well as the social benefits. The widely-held view among practitioners that better production, availability and exploitation of public sector data will create significant efficiencies as well as major discovery (new medical cures, efficacy of policy in education, work, etc) is, I believe, fully justified and not at all exaggerated. I would add a further twist: Britain can be a world leader in this field, because we have the largest coherent data sets anywhere in the world (take health data; we have a single national health service and we are a large, developed nation - no other country has such a massively valuable dataset as that of the NHS). If we also develop the infrastructure to make these properly available to academia and business, we can gain the world-leader advantages that the US achieved in Phase 1 of the Internet. The biggest, most profitable technology companies are based on the West Coast of America, where a single developed market and a combination of public and private investment created a huge economic advantage.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">So Britain has the opportunity to lead the data-focused next phase of technology. In addition to the advantages mentioned above, we have first-class scientific expertise in data analytics, machine learning, etc. We have also benefited from a genuine commitment by the current government and the previous government to promote open data. But now comes the real test: is the government prepared to accept its key role in building the infrastructure? That is the challenge my Review posed: committing oneself to transparency is not enough; merely throwing open some cupboards, as it were, and saying to entrepreneurs, 'here you are, make it happenâ€™ is unlikely to lead to anything but a painfully slow development of value from the data. Yes, by the current route we eventually can and will get to a good-enough place, but we won't reap the huge benefits of being the leader in this new economy.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">To do that, we must </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">recognise</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> the vital strategic role for government. Government holds the data; government controls the timing and manner of its release. Business hesitates to get involved unless the government's protocols and releases are reasonably coherent and predictable. And so far they are not. I have proposed that we should have a plan that clearly defines how, when, and what data is released, how it will be maintained, and how it can be used; and someone to drive this forward in a publicly auditable way.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Furthermore, only government can provide the investment in the basic data science and the training of the data scientists that is needed to unlock the full value of the data. American governments have always supported their key scientific institutions in this way; we should do this too. We need the research investment plan to be clearly linked to the data strategy. The relative cost is low: consider the enormous sunk cost of having generated the data; and the waste if its potential is not fully utilized. It is good to see that a capability strategy is being produced.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">My third point is that there is an urgency to all this if we are serious about reaping the full economic benefits. By what process can government achieve this? My view is that it requires some driver to do this which includes publication of a plan that can be externally audited. One if the recommendations of my review was a streamlining of the various boards responsible for overseeing data strategy. I did not imagine that the first application of my strategic recommendations would be to merge the Data Strategy Board into the Transparency Board. The latter is a brilliant set of people with all the right intentions but it meets infrequently, has no real power to achieve its aims, and from its name makes clear its focus is transparency rather than economic strategic development. Chaired by a minister it is also unable to act with independence or even publish its deliberations. I am delighted to have been made part of this terrific group but we will find it hard to build the needed infrastructure at any speed.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Fourthly, I propose that formal structures be created to embed the use of data in the government's own work, so that adaptation of policy to continuous reliable data on outcomes becomes a required part of the process of government. I believe not only the production but also the use of information will be an increasingly large component of the core role of government, and the sooner we embed that into our processes the better.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Finally, I would urge that we stop being hyper-nervous about the privacy risks of open data, to the point that we obstruct (for example) life-saving and life-enhancing medical advances. I am as committed to privacy as anyone else, but it is a false commitment to create blanket bans to guard against non-existent risks. A concern that people's medical records should remain private has led to a policy that case-level medical data should not be shared with experts conducting research for commercial companies. But the greatest potential lies in the cross-NHS case-level data. Making that available only to academic or government researchers will mean huge opportunities will be lost. The private sector has been responsible for a significant amount of medical advance. Privacy is not best protected in this way. We should grant accreditation to all those who can be identified as UK-based experts from trusted </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">organisations</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> with defined legitimate research </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">programmes</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">; we have technologies readily available that create 'safe havens' which protect </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">anonymised</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> case-level data in stores from which it cannot be removed and monitor who is accessing it, so that in </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">the extremely unlikely case </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">mis</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">-use it can be sourced and punished. Under such a regime it is very hard to construct a realistic case in which broader access to the data could lead to a harmful breach of privacy; and the opportunity for discovery would be much extended.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Essentially I am saying that we should accept government has a bigger, bolder role to play in this exciting new area; building infrastructure for data is precisely the kind of job that government should embrace; that it could do so at low-risk; and that the nation would then reap enormous benefit for a relatively modest investment.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">September 2013</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
