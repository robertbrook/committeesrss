However, in line with other commentators, economists and bodies such as the ILO, the Committee of Regions, ETUC, etc., they expressed serious concern about the adequacy of this level of financial support in effectively implementing EU youth employment reforms such as the YG (targeted especially at NEETs).  In relation to the latter, ILO estimates that the EU requires an injection of €21 billion which represents around 0.45% of </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Eurozone</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> government spending.  This should be seen against an estimated cost of NEETs in 26 MS of about €156 billion (representing 1.51% of EU’s GDP).</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="31" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-indent:-14.2pt"><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> In view of the above discussion, the best way of using rather limited EU resources in the fight against youth unemployment requires that one focus on specific measures for which robust evidence exists that they are most effective in facilitating school-to-work transitions.  For example, long-standing existing evidence as well as the country-specific analysis that we (IES) in partnership with </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Ecorys</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> and IRS Italy have recently completed for the European Commission has shown that apprenticeships have consistently yielded positive employment outcomes and not only in countries typically associated with the dual training system like Germany and Austria.  For most of the apprenticeship programmes reviewed, the majority of apprentices secured employment immediately upon completion e.g. AT, BE, DE, EL, FI, FR, IE, MT, NL, UK; the average proportion is about 60%-70%, while in some cases it is as high as 90%. In addition, within six months to a year after completing the scheme, the proportion of apprentices who secure employment increases even further and is often over 80%.  Likewise, well-designed and targeted YGs can be effective in reducing unemployment and discouragement among young people. Indeed, in its both December 2012 YEP and March 2013 proposals for the €6 billion YEI the Commission put forward such measures among the number of practical and achievable measures with the potential to make an immediate impact.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="color:#0000ff; font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="32" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-indent:-14.2pt"><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Apart from the measures themselves, there are a number of principles that have consistently proved to enhance their likelihood of success.  Evidence has consistently shown that the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">following factors enhance a measure’s likelihood of success: (</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">i</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">) </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">simplicity </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">in that the simpler a measure is, the better it is likely to be received; (ii) </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">transparency</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> in terms of both ensuring that all the necessary information is available and easily accessible by all the relevant stakeholders, including young people; (iii) </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">tailored fit</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">and customised approach</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> in terms of ensuring that the activities involved are tailored to the individual needs and regional/local circumstances.  As has repeatedly been shown, there is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ measure which is effective on a large scale; (</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">iv</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">) </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">measurability</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> in that activities should be designed in such a way that their effectiveness and impact can be measured.

For example, reflecting the disproportionate negative impact that the recent crisis had on the young people, the main topic of the structured dialogue in 2011 was ‘Youth Employment’, while the thematic priority for the current third cycle of SD is the ‘</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">social inclusion of young people across Europe’.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="37" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-indent:-14.2pt"><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The European Parliament has for some time worked closely with young people and their organisations, both at EU and national levels.  This collaboration has become more intensive in view of the current dramatic rise in youth unemployment. </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">For example, from 6 to 8 November 2013 the European Parliament is hosting in Brussels </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">a Citizens’ Agora to combat youth unemployment, where </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">two young people aged 18-30 (one employed and one unemployed) from each MS have been invited.

They take part in both formal consultations and participatory procedures such as the SD as well as in lobbying, awareness raising campaigns and advocacy activities. For example, following the Youth Employment Conference held in Berlin on 3/7/2013, a joint statement of the YFJ and the National Youth Councils stressed that the allocated budget of €6 billion combined with the possibility of using the margins left available below the MMF ceilings was not sufficient to effectively address the currently dramatically high level of youth unemployment in the EU.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="39" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-indent:-14.2pt"><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Some youth organisations have also funded research projects in order to collect the necessary evidence base for specific policies.  For example, in spring 2011 the YFJ conducted the first EU-wide survey of trainees/interns to explore the content, quality, terms and conditions and labour market outcomes of traineeships/internships. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">8.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">How can the EU and Member States embrace new technologies and new methods of working to combat youth unemployment?</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="40" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-indent:-14.2pt"><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> The Commission has started using new technologies and online platforms to communicate with young people and relevant stakeholders (e.g. employers) and, more recently, to combat youth unemployment through transnational mobility for work and/or learning (in the form of apprenticeships and/or traineeships/internships, including Leonardo </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">da</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Vinci and Erasmus work placements).
