Northumberland County Council claims to be unable to afford to provi</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">de an extended town bus service. We estimate that a good town bus service would cost the county about</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> an additional</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> £60,000 a year – about £5 per resident</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">.
