Firstly:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:10pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 27.6pt; padding-left:8.4pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">major works; such as extensions, new-builds, large renovations, and secondly; </span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:10pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 27.6pt; padding-left:8.4pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">minor works, such as additional sockets, a single new circuit etc</span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">With major works, I find that the domestic owner has performed a level of research, whether independently, or via a consultant, and as such they are relatively informed as to the requirements of needing a ‘certificate’ for the works to be carried out. In terms of minor works, I find that the householder is more inclined to be ignorant of the needs for a ‘certificate’.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">I emphasise the term ‘certificate’ as it does have a couple of connotations. Any level of installation work performed by an electrician should result in a certificate (whether it is an Electrical Installation Certificate (EIC) or a Minor Works Certificate (MWC)), which is completed by the installer (or their companies qualified supervisor) and a copy given to the householder (or person ordering the work in the case of a commercial/industrial client). This is the case whether the work is major or minor – based upon my definition above. However, where the confusion begins is that there is another step when works carried out are deemed by Part P of the building regulations to be </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">notifiable</span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">. In the cases where work is </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">notifiable</span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">, the electrical contractor or electrician should notify the work via their competent person scheme, i.e. NAPIT, et al, who then notify the works to the Local Authority Building Control and also send out a completion certificate to the householder. This in essence is what the CP Schemes are about. However, your original question asked whether the public are aware of these requirements to adhere to the Building Regulations, then in reality, my answer would be no; in the majority of cases the public is none-the-wiser as to the requirements of the Building Regulations for notifying electrical works, and none-the-wiser as to the types of works which require notifying under the building regulations.  In a lot of cases, the rogue/cowboy electrical companies will trade upon this </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">ignorance, and when they perform works which would be deemed </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">notifiable</span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt"> under the Building Regulations, and when questioned by a householder whether they will receive a ‘certificate’ after the work is completed, then the rogue/cowboy electrical company will just provide the householder with an electrical installation certificate, and as far as the householder is concerned they have complied with the Building Regulations, when the reality is the rogue/cowboy electrical company may not even be a member of a Competent Person Scheme, and as such it would be </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">anybody’s</span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt"> guess whether the work was performed in a safe manner.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">It should be noted however, that there are numerous electrical companies, which are not registered with any of the Competent Person Schemes, whom are professional, conscientious and carry out works in a safe manner, and conversely, there are electrical companies whom are registered with a Competent Person Scheme that can only be described as ‘Cowboys’.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">the extent to which those carrying out electrical works are adequately trained to meet the requirements of the Building Regulations and the extent to which all those working for a company are brought up to the same level of skills; </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 9pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">I believe that on balance those who are working within the industry and come under the auspices of the Competent Person Schemes are generally adequately trained. However, I believe that the mechanism of the ‘Quality Supervisor’ should be reviewed, as this essentially allows a single person within a company to be assessed for competence whilst generally ignoring all the rest of the company’s workers whom will actually be carrying out the installation works, and in many cases they will be inadequately qualified and/or unsupervised.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">the extent to which those carrying out electrical works, to which the Building Regulations apply, review or have their work reviewed to ensure that it meets the requirements of the Regulations; </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">In situations where work has been correctly notified through the Competent Person Scheme then, the installer, I believe, will typically make sure that their work is to the necessary standard for review. The rogue/cowboy electrical company would not have notified their works, and they will not be members of a Competent Person Scheme, and thus, their work will never be reviewed nor come to light unless there are issues with it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">the adequacy of the review of electrical works carried out by Competent Persons; </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">I believe on the whole the reviews are adequate.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">the effect of competition between accreditation bodies, and the two separate registers of electricians, on the standards of review of domestic electrical work; </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">The video of the Competent Person Scheme representatives answering to the committee was at best a complete farce and shameful of the industry they are representing. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">The fact that there are two registers in operation, purporting to do the same thing only causes mass confusion for both those working within the industry and for the public.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">Some of the remarks made relating to the ‘Electrical Safety Register’ were wilfully dishonest, in that it is not an inclusive register only allowing inclusion if you are a member of NICEIC or </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">Elecsa</span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">; both of which are operated by essentially the same organisation, and thus excluding members of other electrical competent person schemes.
