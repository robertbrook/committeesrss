This situation is very damaging financially on two fronts Firstly the loss of revenue to the country in duty and taxes payable are vast and Secondly, the loss of profit on cigarette and tobacco sales by bona fide retailers is severely damaging to their business' especially the small corner shop retailers - establishments synonymous within these Isles.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Consolas; font-size:10.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Consolas; font-size:10.5pt">Of greater concern though is the selling of counterfeit tobacco products, that is, cigarettes and hand rolling tobacco that is manufactured goodness knows where, by goodness knows who, using goodness knows what.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Consolas; font-size:10.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Consolas; font-size:10.5pt">The threats to health are frightening- does this counterfeit product contain chemicals that will in 2,5 or 10 years cause  an as yet unseen medical condition that will in turn have a huge cost effect for the health service?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Consolas; font-size:10.5pt">In my experience the main age group that would be affected is the under 30's and as the product gets cheaper so the appeal and affordability to young people goes up.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Consolas; font-size:10.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Consolas; font-size:10.5pt">A packet of counterfeit cigarettes now sells in Hereford for £2-50, sold in shops to anyone that has the money.
