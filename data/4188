It confirms the capacity of foodborne pathogens to gain access to and persist on reused plastic bags, and to [re]contaminate high risk and ready to eat food items transported in reused bags. Most of the available information relates to the risks posed by reusable plastic carrier bags, as these are most widely used. However, the identified risks apply equally to all forms of reusable bags, including paper or cloth bags. Irrespective of the specific nature of such bags, the evidence clearly indicates that the reuse of contaminated bags is likely to increase the risks and the incidence of human food related disease.</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">’</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">We would also highlight </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">3 specific issues raised by Professor McDowell:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Take away foods</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic"> are usually not presented in contamination proof containers. For example burger or sandwich packs are not sealed, to allow hot food to “breathe”. While there are no food safety problems with such items coming into contact with the inner surface of (effectively sterile) single use plastic bags, contact with the contaminated surface of a previously used (mutiuse) bag is likely to lead to the undesirable transfer of bacteria onto the cooling “ready to eat” product. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Eating on the move </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold"> - </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">the well established consumer practice of directly eating “take away” foods by hand “from the bag”  -  when that bag is contaminated, especially when consumer’s hands are very unlikely to be washed - will transfer contamination onto the fingers, onto the handled foods, and into the consumer mouth.</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Wider recontamination and pathogen dissemination at retail level</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold"> - </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Customers bringing their own contaminated multiuse bags into a retail environment run the risk of transferring “their” bacteria onto the hands of retail staff, and other retail food contact surfaces as the customer or server places purchased food into the contaminated bags.

However, it is not immediately clear how a retailer could prevent such cross contamination at the point of service.  It should also be borne in mind that such contamination, once established at the point of service, is likely to be serially transferred to food items served to subsequent customers.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">2.

Although there has been limited research on cross contamination by reusable shopping bags, potentially risk of bacterial cross-contamination is present if reusable bags are used to carry both raw and cooked foods.</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic"> In circumstances where multiuse bags are contaminated (through spillage, drip, etc.) and are not subjected to proper decontamination, under favourable conditions pathogens can survive and multiply leading to further contamination of subsequently purchased foods.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">There is an interesting point (Section 7.7) where Professor McDowell highlighted cross-contamination at the point of service if customers bring their own contaminated multiuse bags into a retail environment. Under the current European food legislation EC 852/2004, food premises should have a food safety management system in place based on the HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points) principles. Unless this microbiological hazard – contamination and control measures are clearly identified and recorded in the control chart, it is possible that such problem can be overlooked.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">In the main, I feel that there is a risk of cross-contamination on the use of reusable bags. Such risk can be reduced if consumers are willing to use separate bags for raw and cooked/ready-to-eat foods as well as dispose reusable bags if contaminated with raw meat, e.g. through spillage of raw meat juices, etc. Protection of public health is the priority, and every effort should be made to ensure food safety.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">3.
