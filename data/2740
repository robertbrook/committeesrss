The recent arguments about battery hen cages and sow stalls demonstrate this, as does the UK putting 15% modulation away from direct payments to “rural development” when other countries re doing the opposite due to concerns about food supplies in a rapidly changing climate.  However, the question that needs addressing is how to allow farmers to earn enough to allow them to have a decent standard of living in the bad years as well as the good and also provide stable food prices for the consumers.  The needs of both groups must be regarded as equal rather than the consumer being put above the farmer as all too often seems to be the case.</span></li><li style="font-family:Calibri;

Once there were many dairy farms surrounding our farm and we were a dairy farm ourselves.  As it became uneconomic for small herds to make a living, the cows disappeared and now there is one dairy farm only left.  As the cows went, the birds declined in both species and number and the connection is obvious – no cows, no manure, no insects and no birds!  The present push towards robotic milking machines means that the cows live indoors all year round, their manure is spread only as slurry and the natural process of cow pats decaying naturally on grass is lost, so this is also likely to be detrimental to the environment.</span></li><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Every gardener knows that some plants are more vigorous than others when growing and so they have to be kept in check or they will swamp their weaker neighbours and thus kill them. The same happens in our fields and on our hills and under grazed land soon sees a decrease in bio-diversity as the weaker species are choked out.  One only needs to look at the bracken covered slopes of Cumbria where the sheep were never re-introduced after 2001’s Foot  and Mouth disease epidemic to see the truth of this.</span></li><li style="font-family:Calibri;
