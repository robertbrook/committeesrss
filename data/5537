For example, to be a truly ecologically coherent network that will protect habitats and species that are rare, threatened or representative of UK biodiversity, it will be important to ensure that examples of all stages of life cycles of mobile and migratory species be encompassed by the network i.e. spawning and nursery grounds, foraging and rafting areas, breeding / pupping / nesting areas. Mobile species have not so far been adequately addressed through the existing initiatives to designate MCZs or in the implementation of the Habitats and Species Directive.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:113%; margin:14pt 0pt 14pt 18pt; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:11pt">4.4</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:11pt">The Natural England and JNCC guidance on the development of an ecologically coherent network reports on an assessment undertaken to assess the potential conservation benefit of MCZs for highly mobile species of conservation importance. The assessment concluded that the current knowledge of the ecology and behaviour of many highly mobile species suggests that site-based protection may be appropriate but that there was no spatial data to support the identification of relevant areas in UK waters. It does however highlight that important foraging, breeding (including nursery and spawning grounds), moulting, wintering and resting areas, should be included in the MPA network.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:113%; margin:14pt 0pt 14pt 18pt; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:11pt">4.5</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:11pt">The designation of MCZs, MPAs in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and of SACs and SPAs, is not yet complete. However at a future point, before a network can be considered complete, an assessment should be undertaken to ensure that connectivity has been adequately addressed for species that are dependent on a range of habitats or sites during their life cycle. Furthermore, such an assessment should ensure that there is appropriate integration between protected sites at the land / sea interface and between important sites at marine boundaries i.e. across devolved boundaries and at the boundaries with neighbouring States. It is conceivable that a number of ecologically important sites will span such borders, as does the Dogger Bank in the central North Sea. In cases where an important site is identified spanning a border, collaborative effort should be undertaken with the devolved administration or adjacent governments to secure appropriate protection across the whole site.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:113%; margin:14pt 0pt 14pt 18pt; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:11pt">4.6</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:11pt">In order for the network to deliver against international commitments, designation of the sites alone will be insufficient. Sites will need to be managed in a manner appropriate to the individual objectives of each site and in relation to the objectives of the network as a whole. A range of management approaches, including both strict protection and multi-use techniques, is likely to be required to ensure that the network is well-managed and supports the delivery of international commitments as envisaged.

Co-ordinated implementation by UK Government and Devolved Administrations of existing European (e.g. the Birds and Habitats Directives) and national legislation (e.g. the Marine &amp; Coastal Access Act (2009), the Marine (Scotland) Act (2010) and the Marine Act (Northern Ireland) 2013) can make an important contribution to achieving GES, as well as fulfilling wider sustainable development objectives.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:113%; margin:14pt 0pt 14pt 18pt; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:11pt">5.3</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:11pt">The MSFD states that measures to achieve GES should include spatial protection measures contributing to coherent and representative networks of MPAs, adequately covering the diversity of the constituent ecosystems.

This is a particular challenge for Europe’s regional seas where different bodies at different governance scales with different constituent interests are all involved, each making, or contributing to, decisions affecting the area. The main disparity in the governance framework arises as a result of differing competencies, often at the same governance level (e.g. in relation to the MSFD and CFP), which constrains a coherent approach to integrated decision-making.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:113%; margin:14pt 0pt 14pt 18pt; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:11pt">6.2</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:11pt">Under the Directive each Member State is required to develop a marine strategy for their waters, in coordination with other countries within the same marine region or subregion - in the UK’s case these being the Greater North Sea and the Celtic Seas - to protect and conserve the marine environment, prevent its deterioration, and, where practicable, restore marine ecosystems in areas where they have been adversely affected. This coordination is intended to be achieved through the Regional Seas Conventions, which for the UK is the </span><a href="http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-1370"><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:11pt">OSPAR Convention</span></a><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:11pt">.

One of the key initiatives that we believe the UK government should focus on is finding a mechanism to gather the most appropriate marine stakeholders in any one sea area in order to obtain their support for a programme of management that will deliver for key environmental, economic and societal sustainability objectives. It is WWF’s view that only by engaging the stakeholders across the sectors in the development of such measures will there be a high chance of compliance with the resulting programme of work. The work of the Advisory Councils established under the reformed CFP will be important in offering a starting point for the convening of fisheries stakeholders but there is a need to think about how wider participation can be achieved across the different sectors.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:113%; margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 17.85pt; text-indent:-17.85pt"><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:11pt">6.5</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:11pt">Recognising this, the WWF-led </span><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">PISCES project</span><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:11pt"> (</span><a href="http://www.projectpisces.eu/"><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:11pt">http://www.projectpisces.eu/</span></a><span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:11pt">) brought together stakeholders from the Celtic Sea to develop a set of guidelines for implementing the MSFD with involvement of stakeholders throughout the process, including management decisions, monitoring and enforcement of measures.
