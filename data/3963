</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Stuart:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Good morning and welcome to this session of the Education Committee looking into residential children’s homes.  Thank you very much for joining us today.  We tend to use first names; I hope we are all happy with that.  Could I start with the police representatives if I may?  On 19 November, the Public Administration Select Committee heard evidence from former police officers suggesting that police were routinely manipulating crime figures to meet Government performance targets.  Reporting on the evidence session, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">The Times</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> said, “Official statistics recorded by police are regularly skewed, with serious crimes downgraded, sexual offences categorised as ‘no crimes’ and victims’ reports about offending not recorded.”  Given these revelations about the manipulation of crime figures in order to meet performance targets, how can we trust police figures on the number of children going missing from care and the numbers of children who are exploited?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Chief Constable Geenty</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: First of all, I understand some of the comments that have been made about police crime recording, but I do not recognise some of the criticism made of police figures.  Over the recent past there has been a rigorous enforcement of the crime recording standards by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary.  Whilst they do find discrepancies between forces and the quality of the recording, overall the standard of recording crime in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Great Britain</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is thought to be the best in the world.  I do not quite recognise some of those comments.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q86 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Stuart:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> When you say you do not recognise it, are you saying that you are confident there is no skewing?  That the former police officers suggesting that any manipulation goes on were giving false testimony?  What is your explanation of that?  We know that accountability drives behaviour and any system, however well designed, can have perverse outcomes.  Are you suggesting that the police are uniquely proofed to such perverse pressures?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Chief Constable Geenty</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Of course I am not, and of course I would accept that there will be anomalies and discrepancies in any accounting system, wherever it is run.   Nothing is 100% perfect.  In terms of can you have confidence in the crime figures, is there endemic corruption in terms of police manipulation of figures, I would absolutely refute that.  The systems that we have in place, the National Crime Recording Standards set the bar very high for police forces.  They are inspected regularly.  Any manipulation of crime figures is dealt with very seriously, as you can see from HMIC reports.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q87 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Pat Glass:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Are you confident that children are safe?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Chief Constable Geenty</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: That is what I was coming to.  The issues around missing from care and children missing from care, those figures are not just dependent on the police; they come from a variety of sources.  Whilst they may not be absolutely accurate, the work that we have done over the last 12 to 18 months in terms of standardising our recording procedures between Ofsted, the Department for Education and the police—whereas we used different criteria before, we now use the same criteria.  That is helping us to get the figures right.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I remember last year there was a huge discrepancy between the number of figures missing children from children’s homes that was reported by Ofsted and the numbers of figures reporting for missing children by the police.  It caused quite a considerable public concern.  That led to a number of the changes that you see and some of that is in the report that is in front of you for consideration.  I am confident that we are moving in the right direction.  We recognise the importance of the data and that the figures are getting more and more reliable as time passes.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Superintendent Taylor</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I agree with everything Mr Geenty said.  There are two issues for me: one is about identifying the right targets to try and prevent those perverse incentives, so that as a service we are delivering the best quality and service for children and young people as we can.  The second part of that is how we share that information.  It is not just about recorded crime; it is about incidents, behaviour, and understanding patterns and trends within certain areas so that, as a multiagency, we can deliver that good service.  For me, it is about that information sharing: how do we share that information with our partners?  How do we understand the real picture alongside the crime figures?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q88 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Stuart:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> A care home manager said to me that she would go to almost any lengths to avoid bringing in the police if she could help it.  This was in the context of a children’s home with quite a number of teenagers and quite a history of children leaving that home.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Ward:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Or a child getting a criminal record, I think she said. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Superintendent Taylor</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Interestingly, in schools there is a protocol linked to the National Crime Recording Standards about how crime can be dealt with in schools.  Notifiable offences can be dealt with by the school.  There is good information sharing with schools officers and local links with the police services.  It is about providing that information, about understanding incidents that take place without criminalising young people.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I would very much support a similar process for residential care homes where those protocols are developed: the conversation takes place with the police service prior to the crime being formally recorded, and then looking at what is the most appropriate disposal and response to that child and young person.  Boundaries have to be set, absolutely.  Children in the homes need to understand what is and is not acceptable behaviour, but how we deal with that as a multiagency is really important.  A protocol has been written and I would urge pushing that through to get a similar protocol for recording crimes in schools similarly for children and young people.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q89 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Stuart:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Jane, you have been involved in this area of work for many years.  Is it fair to say that we have a system that is both expensive and has poor outcomes?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jane Booth</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I cannot answer the “expensive” question because I think it is relative to outcome.  I will answer the outcome one.  Many of these children have very significant needs; they are going to be expensive to care for.  The external placements that we have, for example, in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Rochdale</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, are expensive placements.  The concern is whether or not they produce a good outcome.  If the children in those placements are not well matched, which often seems to be the case, then that can increase the risks they face rather than reduce them.  You do not have the good outcome; whatever the price is, that is an expensive placement.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q90 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Stuart:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> In answer to my question, do you think—looking systemically—that we do have something that manages to be both expensive and ineffective?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jane Booth</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The majority of placements that we experience in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Rochdale</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> struggle to provide those good outcomes, but they are working with some of the most challenging young people in the country.  I am aware of some very good examples of very specialist homes who provide care that could not be provided elsewhere and do produce good outcomes.  In the majority of cases we are often working with these young people at a point where it is very hard to turn them round.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q91 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Stuart:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Iryna, have we got an expensive and ineffective system overall in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Iryna Pona</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: First of all, I would like to say thank you for inviting the Children’s Society to be here.  The Children’s Society has over 130 years of experience supporting vulnerable children, and over the last 30 years we have focused our work on young runaways and missing children.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In answer to your question, I agree with Jane that it is very important to focus on the needs of the child and what we see very often is that placements are made not on the focus of the child, but on where the placement is available.  If the needs of the child are not the central part of the care planning for that particular child, not just needs but also views and wishes of the child are not taken into account, it is very likely that the placement will lead to breakdown and there will be another breakdown after another breakdown.  In the end that is very expensive.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q92 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Stuart:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I am struggling to get either of you to give me a yes/no answer to what may be a very difficult question.  If we do have a system that lets down the most vulnerable children and manages, at the same time, to be extraordinarily expensive, then you would think </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">that reform would need to be fairly systemic in its approach.  Would it be a fair criticism, Iryna, that the Government’s proposed changes are rather more minor than fundamental?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Iryna Pona</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The proposed changes will make a contribution to making residential children’s care homes safer for children because they will look at assessment of how safe areas are and some other areas hopefully will improve: notification processes and other things.  However, to make these reforms successful there needs to be three key factors.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The first one is that they need to be part of a more comprehensive, wider reform of the care system looking at how the child finds the care system from the very beginning, how placement decisions are made, quality of care, learning process and all the way through to the moment the child leaves the care system and what support they get there.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The second important factor is that there needs to be proper oversight, because there have been very good reforms in the past and we do have quite a lot of good statutory guidance and legislation already in place, but the implementation is very patchy.  The quality of provision for looked-after children is very patchy.  There has to be very good oversight, not just at the national level from Ofsted, but also at the local level from local safeguarding children’s boards.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The third point for me is probably one of the most important: this reform feels like it is done for children rather than with children.  It needs to be done more in a way where we bring the child’s needs to the centre of the care planning system of responses that we apply when they are missing, and that we listen and engage with young people, rather than try and punish and discipline them.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Ward:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Some of us visited </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Margate</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in Thanet yesterday and saw what appeared to be a very impressive example of a multiagency taskforce with a strong police involvement.  What seemed to be very important and evident was the local knowledge.  Our bus driver, who was a police officer, who I think had been there for 20-odd years, a long time, he knew everybody who we drove past.  A broad question to begin with, which is about the multiagency working: across the piece, how well do you think agencies are working together, at present, on this whole issue of children in care and preventing missing children?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Chief Constable Geenty</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: From the police perspective the landscape is getting better.  For example, in my own force area, we have just introduced a Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hub, MASH.  I put my missing child co-ordinators into the MASH as well so that the relationship between the care homes and the residential homes in the area is part of the MASH.  That helps our information sharing and joint working.  </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That is working really well</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The issue for me is more about a local one for officers.  Neighbourhood officers and neighbourhood policing is the cornerstone of this relationship.  That is why it is fundamental to, I believe, the improvement of quality in how we manage this whole process.  Local officers who know the residential homes and the children have a relationship that is not based on whether it is a matter of enforcement of the law: they know each other, they go into the residential homes, they interact, they know each other on an informal basis.  That is beginning to take place.  That could come from the way in which we develop, which my colleague might want to touch on, what we call corporate parenting.  That is something that is currently sadly lacking in care homes.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">Margate</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, I chair a South East Regional Group, so I am aware of the work in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Margate</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.  One of the things we have developed in the south-east is a protocol to prevent the criminalisation of looked-after children, which is looking at the principles of how we manage reported crime and the best outcomes, which we talked about earlier.  That is something that is really important and we are looking to sign that off in December.  Our ambition is that that should become much more of a national protocol because looked-after children, regardless of where they are in the country, should receive the same consistent level of service and the same boundaries in whatever care home.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Corporate parenting is really important.  We know that looked-after children in residential care homes are there for all sorts of different reasons.  It can be behavioural; it can be because their parents are unable to support them.  It is important that we do recognise them as a distinct group and parent them effectively, as you would be parented in a family home.  One of the challenges is that there are often levels of behaviour accepted in children’s homes that would not be accepted in a family home.  When that behaviour is then displaced into the community, it is at an unacceptable level.  One of my big urges would be that corporate parenting reflects that: that that responsibility is held by the corporate parents and they take a responsibility for the management of the young people as well as understanding that risk.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That leads on to my third point about multiagency working.  Local knowledge is absolutely essential.  Yes, we need to build those relationships, we need to have good collaborative working with care homes.  One of the challenges for us is where you have an out-of-force placement.  With that child coming to an area you do not have the information on that background.  Without that, you cannot make a fully informed decision about the best way to manage or support that child.  In an ideal world I would like to see children placed within their own area; where that is not achievable, an information pack should be available to the multiagency so that you are properly informed and we can make decisions on that basis, supporting that local knowledge.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">Rochdale</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has had to focus on some of these issues, perhaps more urgently than has happened in some other areas.  What we have been able to see is that the agencies have responded by coming together to try to reduce the risks that young people who are in external placements face, because we have a lot of external private providers in our authority.  What has happened is that the agencies have established a multiagency forum, so the private providers meet monthly with representatives from the police, children’s social care, and the youth offending team.  They have developed a protocol that is a deficit model, because we do have good information sharing from external places, so that the homes themselves notify the agencies that a young person has arrived.  The agency prioritises resources so that the direct commissioning budgets have been increased for the looked after children’s nurse.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

there is no additional budget that comes with it.  We do, at least, have some assurance that we know is in the borough.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What we hear from the providers—who are also very supportive of this, because they also want to meet these children’s needs—is concern that they are still not getting good information, that the placements are often made in a hurry, that risks are not always shared adequately and sometimes they are told “we need a decision within 20 minutes” about a placement.  That is the case even with young people who have come in from environments where you would imagine planning was possible, such as secure psychiatric provision.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt"> One of the things I have found difficult is to distinguish between those things that should be statutory requirements and just really good practice and what should be legislated for and not.  One of the consultation areas was on the statutory guidance, and it has been reduced from 60-odd pages to 20, I believe.  It has been referred to by the DCS as, “So general they do not add much to existing guidance and knowledge”, and that it was “weak” in addressing issues relating to children going missing from parental homes.  What are your views on the statutory guidance?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jane Booth</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Guidance has to be supported by good training.  I do not think writing copious amounts of guidance necessarily ensures good practice.  Having staff on the ground who understand their core duties and responsibilities, are trained and have the time to work directly with young people is likely to be much more beneficial than writing reams of guidance.  We know, for example, that the legislation and guidance around placements requires notification, good care plans, and placements to be matched with the child’s needs.  The guidance has not delivered that for us.  Practitioners need to change to understand that.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt"> The definitions: I know there is some concern among the police about the sheer effort involved in responding to the calls coming through about missing children.  Would you like to make some comments on the need for a tight definition on this?  I know the police definition is much more defined and strict.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Chief Constable Geenty</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We had a very broad, generic definition of what was a missing person, whether it be a child or an adult.  What the practitioners were saying was that the response to a child missing from care had become routine and mechanical: a child would be reported missing, they would be risk assessed and then the response officers would be sent to go and find them.  Usually the officers would know where that child was, go and pick them up, take them back to the care home.  It was not the officers’ fault; it was just the way the system was constructed.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We introduced a new definition of absence so that we could prioritise cases where children had been missing repeatedly.  We could identify them in our system; we could give it a different category of response.  It is in its early stages and what we are beginning to change is the culture.  We now have missing person co-ordinators in the majority of forces, whose </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">responsibility is to look at the information about who is going missing and how often—we can do that through the absent category—and then to put care packages together to make sure we respond effectively.  The new definition enables the control room operators, the missing person co-ordinators to distinguish from the 330,000 missing reports that the police service gets every year and to break it down into those areas where we really need to focus our attention.  Those that go missing more than three times, for example, set off alarm bells.  We are able to look at the signs and symbols.  It links into child sexual exploitation.  We can begin to give it a different category of response than we were giving before.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The definitions have been very helpful.  There is ongoing work about looking at their effectiveness and how they are being implemented across the country.  We want to make sure that the safeguarding aspects of it, the way in which we intervene in those cases that need intervention, are dealt with.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">If I can share an example from practice, we had a case where a young person was reported missing.  She was reported missing repeatedly from a children’s home and she was categorised as “absent” by the police, despite the fact that the carers were really worried about her because she was going missing to her mum, who had a range of mental health problems, was abusing substances and did not have a fixed address.  There were quite a lot of risks involved, but the understanding of risk in that particular area by the police and by the care home were </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

a huge number of cases were related to placement and how placement decisions were made.  Very often children are not informed about a placement move, or they feel they are in a settled placement but then the decision is changed and they are moved to a new placement without any explanation made to them about why this decision was made.  It leads to breakdown in relationship placement stability and the relationship with a trusted adult.  These are two key things for making sure that children have positive outcomes and experiences of care.  If it does not happen, there are a chain of events that lead to unsuccessful care experiences for children.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Placing the child at the centre and giving them an opportunity to have a say in decisions is hugely important, as it is when a child runs away or goes missing—they must have the opportunity to talk to someone, to explain the reasons why, to explore what they can do to prevent future missing episodes.  We can see from other practices that where there is that communication with the child, it is more effective.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

obviously it is not good enough.  Maybe some things can be changed around access to independent advocacy services, for example, which would help children  Not all children will be comfortable and confident to speak in meetings where there are lots of adults.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

that is not satisfactory.  As far as I am concerned it needs to be at a strategic level.  I, for example, will go to the local safeguarding children board, not as a regular member but just to go and visit and see what is going on so I know what my superintendents and chief inspectors are doing.  I found the quality of the board tends to reflect—this might be controversial—the quality of the independent chair.  If you have a really strong independent chair on the board who is robust and will hold all the agencies to account, then the board works very well.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

people who are involved in the assessment of risk need to understand how to do it, be trained appropriately and be given the right skills and tools to do so.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The second part is some of the cultural issues that need to be addressed.  It is really important, particularly with things like return interviews for missing children, where the guidance suggests that local authorities should be doing it, that we need to ensure that is taking place and those conversations are then happening.  The comments that young people may make, from whatever organisation is having that conversation, need to be taken in all seriousness and the gravity of some of the comments they may make needs to be understood.  Sometimes it is too easy to miss some of those comments and not necessarily pick up on some of those risk factors.  That is where that training and tool set is really important.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

or they have a set of different criteria when they provide what they consider the risk and they are the absolute opposite, depending on what area you are talking about.  It is also very important that the return interview is not the end of the process and that there is follow-up activity.  Return interviews will only be good if you come up with a plan of action to address the reason why young people are running away.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Stuart:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Good morning and welcome to you.  Thank you very much for appearing before us today to talk about this important issue.  Ofsted’s new single inspection framework for children’s services emphasises the importance of inspectors’ judgment in determining the quality of services and practice.  Do you feel that Ofsted’s workforce has sufficient expertise and knowledge of social care practice to be able to make accurate assessments?   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Andrew Webb</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Ofsted’s workforce is large and variable.  Some of their inspectors have been recently in practice, others not for a long time.  It is very important, when you think about an inspection regime, to link the quality of the analysis with the quality of the final judgement given.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In general, Ofsted’s inspectors are able to carry out that role of getting behind the data, looking very professionally at the nature of a child’s experience where they meet children, and making professional judgements about what is going on.  However, the issue is when they then try to move from that general professional judgment into very definitive statements, for which you would, perhaps, want a far more scientific basis.  If you are going to come with a quasi-scientific judgement then you need a set of tools that are very different from those that are being used.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">One of the problems we have with the Ofsted regime is not so much the quality of the inspectors but the purpose to which their judgments are put, which is to create an impression that you can sum up a very complex institution with a very clear picture.  In fact, it is almost never as simple as that.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt"> You talk about summing up an institution, but if we want a system that is built around the child then, while we are interested in the institution, we see it as part of a complex array of agencies that are supposed to work together for the child.  It could be that we have an outstanding institution but such is the distance, weakness, lack of supervision or </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">whatever of somebody else in the system that the child’s needs are not being met.  Is that true?  Do Ofsted inspections capture enough of the whole picture and hold people to account to make sure that the interests of the child are paramount?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Andrew Webb</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Ofsted inspect from both ends: t</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">hey inspect local authorities through a single inspection framework and follow the journey of that child, so the answer to that would be yes, generally.  When they look at the regulatory inspections of children’s homes, they see a very partial picture because they go in to inspect an establishment in which the child is living.  You cannot always marry the two effectively, because sometimes the children’s home is very distant from the local authority that is making the placement.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Our experience as a provider with Ofsted, it is fair to say, is a mixed bag when it comes to consistency of inspections.  There is a real focus now on regulations, with compliance, which is good, because everybody should be compliant.  However, there is a shortfall when it comes to looking at the starting point for individual young people.  The young people that we receive in the independent sector have had numerous breakdowns.  A large proportion of them have numerous placement breakdowns.  They have major issues around trauma, abuse and trust.  They have had chequered educational histories so the base line starting point for young people often is not given as much weight as it should be, in my experience in a number of inspections.  Consequently, young people may be moving on a journey of improvement, but because that is not taken into account it is reflected fairly negatively in the inspection reports that are produced. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Tim Parlow</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I would agree that it is a large system so it is going to be a mixed picture.  I would pick up on the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">point you made about outstanding providers not necessarily meeting individual child’s outcomes well.  The reverse can also be true.  We have worked with providers who received a poor Ofsted rating, based on an inspection at a point of time and sometimes based on compliance issues with policy—so largely bureaucratic reasons for getting a poor judgment—where the children that were placed with them were, in fact, making very good progress.  This is because local authorities will be very aspirational for this group of young people and will not want to place </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">children </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">in providers where there is a perception that it needs improvement.  </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

the Ofsted regime, in relation to children’s homes themselves, ought to look much more carefully at the outcomes.  The framework we have for identifying how much difference a children’s home placement has </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">made to a child’s life is not good.  To clarify, the evidence is not very good but often the contribution is very good.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The history of Ofsted inspections of children’s home started with compliance and regulation, making sure that staffing ratios were right and diet was adequate and so on.  We need to move very much further on from that to an examination of how much impact a home has, whether it has contracted with the right people to provide the right specialist expertise, whether they have it in house and so on.  No school in the country would expect to get away with the sort of inspection that a children’s home does on attainment and achievement.  That needs to change if we are going to have a radical impact over the next couple of years on the purpose of children’s homes and what they achieve.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It is also important, from my perspective, that Ofsted come just twice a year, for two days out of 365, and they form a view.  We as an organisation always work towards having robust and very honest self regulation.  We are there day in, day out and we need to create robust reports—regulation 33 and 34 reports—that go to regulators, local authorities and other stakeholders that evidence what is going on, on a much more frequent basis.  Equally, local authorities come in and visit the homes through various commissioning or child care reviews; independent reviewing officers and visitors also come in, and they all form very important parts of what is going on for that child and how the home is performing. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Kamran Abassi</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The key areas are reducing out-of-area placements, the suitability of the locations of children’s homes, the level of qualifications of staff and managers, quality assurance and also partnerships.  Those particular areas are very important areas to focus on.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The very key one for me, which is probably underplayed, is the role of effective leadership and management at a children’s home level.  They are absolutely critical.  I have been a homes manager myself.  I have supervised home managers.  The role they play in setting the culture, value, nurture, ambition and holding other stakeholders accountable, where they are failing young people, is absolutely pivotal.  There needs to be more emphasis on the leadership and management.  I believe Jonathan Stanley talked about that.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There also needs to be focus on the fact that residential care is part of a wider lax system we need to look at reforming.  There needs to be far more robust assessments and early intervention with young people to try to prevent them coming to the children’s home sector.  There needs to be much better care planning and getting the right placement initially for a child, rather than having a young person who is in the DfE data set who is 15-years-old, has had lots of placement breakdowns, like I explained before: they have major issues around trauma, trust and abuse.  It takes five or six months of hard resilience working to try to build a relationship of trust with that young person, often when placements are very short term in nature anyway.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It is a whole system of reform that is needed.  If we can do an early assessment on people when they are younger and put in place the right interventions earlier, it should avoid the cost to the young person and to the state at a later stage.  There have definitely been early intervention and missed opportunities throughout the early childhood of most young people, if you look at their chronologies.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The workforce issues definitely need to be picked up.  We need a good debate about what every children’s home is trying to achieve.  The whole emphasis on expanding the statement of purpose and aligning resources people have in the children’s home to deliver on that statement of purpose is to be welcomed.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">To pick up on the last point, this is a whole-system issue.  The Association of Directors of Children’s Services carried out a piece of work last year;

font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">r?  </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What we looked at was the care system and what it did well and what it did less well.  The thing it does least well is meet the needs of adolescents who enter care for first time as adolescents, i.e. the children’s home population.  Children’s homes are used quite extensively for children who, in other countries, would not end up in the children’s home system.  We should look at much more flexible ways of providing restorative approaches to community involvement, more flexible non-registrable approaches to providing space and time for children and families in local communities, as well as then concentrating on, perhaps, a smaller residential care sector with a much clearer statement of purpose.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt"> That is a fair point.  Ideally you would anticipate the problems earlier, intervene earlier and avoid the need to take the child away from the family in the first place.  Assuming the child has entered residential care, do we have the right incentives in place to ensure the home authority is working hard with parents from the moment the child comes into the system, to ensure that that child could be returned to the family earlier?  Take your 14-year-old: perhaps, if the right family intervention went into place they could be returned after a year, rather than two years.  If they are going to come back, they would probably prefer to come back after a year if you can make sure it is safe and you have dealt with the problems that led to the child’s removal in the first place.  Is that a fair point?  Any thoughts on what that would look like?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Andrew Webb</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes, those are some of the things we have looked at exploring and we would need to be quite innovative.  Your last session talked extensively about the regulation.  At the moment, we have a system that if you are in it, you are highly regulated and, perhaps, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">approaching a more heavily regulated area and if you are not in it, you are not in a regulated area at all: you are either in or out of care.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">How can we be more flexible in our use of resources?  Children come into care at a point of real family crisis, let us not forget that, and often at a point when neither the child nor family can see any alternative other than separation.  However, the system where a child is in care and then moves sometimes quite a long way from home, because of the lack of available places locally, gets in the way of that early bridge building.  Some of our approaches to care assume, “We have now taken over the care of this child”, as opposed to, “This is very much a shared arrangement and we ought to drive all our services and direction of an earlier return home.”  I am not sure how we create incentives.  That is a culture shift, a professional practice issue rather than an intervention issue it seems.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-weight:bold">Andrew Webb</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: No, not always.  We know from the data that is in the public domain at the moment that adolescents are as much at risk of abuse, exploitation, neglect and various other forms of harm as younger children, so no.  However, where there is an opportunity to build that bridge, it is not always taken.  However, that is not through a lack of child welfare focus because the child is placed in a home, is safe and their well-being is being dealt with.  It is just that in the long term, it may have been more appropriate to keep them at home.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">numbers of children.  Going back to that point, we need to be sure that the changes cover all those types of provision, and in that sense I would say that perhaps the proposals do not go far enough.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The big challenge we see is when we have submitted, for example, our child protection procedures in the past to the local safeguarding boards, to get the local safeguarding boards to sign those off as compliant to the local areas.  Equally, we feel the biggest hurdle that we have seen to ensure that the missing from care protocols or policies we have in place are compliant with the police and LSCB is making sure they sign those off as consistent with their areas.  There is a lot of training that we provide in this particular area, when it comes to missing from care and CSE training for our workforce at initially level one, which is basic awareness, signs and symptoms, going through to a level two and three, which is managing complex cases, interagency working and information sharing.  There is quite a lot that we are already onto on this particular area.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The thing I would push back in terms of the 2011 standards is they were fairly prescriptive when it came to what should be included in induction of care workers before they could work directly with young people.  That came out in 2011 and I would urge that there are far more prescriptive conditions applied to what people should have in terms of minimum training requirements to be working with children.  That has been taken out of the current standards.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Andrew Webb</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Not an ideological concern, no.  My concern would be if we moved into the market dominance that we saw with Southern Cross in the adult sector and if an organisation with so many vulnerable lives in their hands goes bust then it has a massive impact.  Equally, some of the residential establishments that give me the most concern are those single ownership, with insufficient working capital, a single provider with the best of intentions and an inadequate business model.  We need a spread.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;
