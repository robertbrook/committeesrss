The rationale is simple: that local communities are best-placed to make decisions on matters that directly affect them. This is particularly relevant to transport expenditure – previously, funding was allocated through a number of streams, leading to a silo-based approach that acted as a barrier to the integrated approach required to facilitate job creation and growth. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The current approach is a significant improvement over the process of annual funding settlement.

The Department for Transport allocated £2.4 billion for 2014/15, compared to just £2.085 billion for the rest of the country as a whole. This inequality presents a serious challenge to rebalancing the UK economy and to promoting growth outside of the South East. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">There is, however, an opportunity to close the funding gap. Key stakeholders across the West Midlands have, together, drawn up the HS2 Connectivity Package – a £2 billion package of local, sustainable transport infrastructure investments that together, if implemented in full, have the potential to double the economic benefits of HS2 for the region.

The devolution of funds from Whitehall to localities has significant potential to unlock growth outside of the South East and take steps towards rebalancing the nation’s economy, and the medium-term, semi-competitive nature of the Fund is a good balance between the certainty and the competition required to stimulate strong and innovative plans.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">One key challenge is that currently, the vast majority of the Local Growth Fund is Department for Transport funding. Furthermore, the Department has been clear that the LGF is the only source of funding available for investment in transport infrastructure over the period of 2015/16 – 2020/21. The nature of the Local Growth Fund as a “single pot” means there is a significant risk that the reduction in the capital allocation already mentioned will be compounded by spend on non-transport interventions. Furthermore, the focus of the Fund on interventions to stimulate growth and job creation means that prioritising the limited funding for the maintenance of significant transport structures will be a significant challenge.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The Local Growth Fund is a good start, but at £2 billion per annum is a small fraction of the sum envisaged by Lord Heseltine in </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">No Stone Unturned</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">.
