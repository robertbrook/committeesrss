It is our opinion that the proposed changes would result in an unfair inequ</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ality of arms between the state and an individual subject to its power – an inequality that is all the more marked for children and young people, whose particular vulnerabilities create distinct barriers to their ability to access justice and have their vo</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ices and wishes heard.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">2.

Changes to legal aid for prison law matters will mean that children and young people in custody will not get legal support to deal with many of the crucial issues they face or to challenge d</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ecisions that affect their lives and their liberty. It is likely that many foreign national children in the prison estate will be affected by the residence test proposals. ECPAT UK’s experience is that, despite Association of Chief Police Officers guidance</span><a name="_ftnref3"></a><a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> and Crown Prosecution Service policy guidance</span><a name="_ftnref4"></a><a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">, and the principle that victims of trafficking should be protected and not punished, many children who have been trafficked are arrested and charged, prosecuted and convicted for crimes they have been forced</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> to commit as a direct result of their trafficking. This means that hundreds of children end up in custody and in the prison estate, and subsequently in immigration detention. These are highly vulnerable individuals who, under the proposals, will no longer</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> have legal assistance to challenge the lawfulness of detention. In the wider context of the proposals, these individuals may also be hampered in their ability to bring criminal appeal cases against convictions for crimes committed as a direct result of tr</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">afficking (see Q5 on Judicial Review). Judicial reviews have driven prison reform in </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">relation to children.

The need for legal representation of child victims of trafficking for prison law matters is likely to increase not decrease in line with the increase in the phenomenon of trafficking a</span><span style="color:#141413; font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">nd exploitation itself</span><a name="_ftnref6"></a><a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a><span style="color:#141413; font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">. The number of cannabis farms identified within the UK has been increasing, from just over 3,000 in 2007 to almost 8,000 in 2011. The size and scale of these farms has been changing too. The increase in cannabis farms has been seen </span><span style="color:#141413; font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">alongside a growing number of Vietnamese child and adult victims of trafficking. In 2011, 30 victims (two-thirds of them children) were identified through the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) as trafficked and forced to work in a cannabis factory. 27 of t</span><span style="color:#141413; font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">hese were Vietnamese</span><a name="_ftnref7"></a><a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a><span style="color:#141413; font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">. 2012 saw a 45% increase in the total number of Vietnamese nationals referred into the NRM. Perhaps most tellingly, in 2012, Vietnam was the top country of origin for trafficked minors</span><a name="_ftnref8"></a><a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a><span style="color:#141413; font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">; the number identified (93) through the NRM bein</span><span style="color:#141413; font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">g a 63% increase from the previous year.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">10. In our work, ECPAT UK frequently comes across trafficking for cannabis cultivation cases or incidences where a young person has been trafficked for forced criminality, such as forced theft/begging/shoplifting. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">11. In 2011/12 only 1.12% of all legal aid spending was spent on prison law, but the current proposals will dramatically affect the assistance available to all children, including those who have been trafficked and exploited, denying them access to justice</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">12. ECPAT UK disagrees with the proposed approach for limiting legal aid, which means children would have to prove to their lawyers that they were living in the United Kingdom lawfully and had been for at least 12 months continuously. Child victims of t</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">rafficking are unlikely to be able to establish that they meet this test despite being recognised as a particularly vulnerable category of persons. A factual and legal investigation into whether a child can satisfy the lawful residence would need to be car</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ried out and established prior to any work on the substantive case being commenced. It is likely to mean that many individuals will be denied help from the outset as lawful residence will be the gateway through which these children will not be able to pass</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">. It is our belief that the residence test would undermine the rule of law for children (and adults) who may have strong cases against public authorities but are unable to pursue them effectively. It would also be unworkable on </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">a practical level and would </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">act as a barrier for children accessing justice.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">13. The residence test is inconsistent with Articles 3 and 12 of the UNCRC, which is frequently used to interpret children’s human rights in domestic case law. Such a test would not allow children to effect</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ively participate in critical decisions affecting them and their futures, which would directly contravene Article 12. The test would not pay regard to Article 3, which states that the best interests of a child should be a primary consideration. A proposal </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">that curtails a child’s access to legal representation and justice to challenge failures against them is clearly not in a child’s best interests.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">14. The proposals state that in order to be eligible for legal aid, the applicant would have to be ‘lawfully r</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">esident’ in the UK and at the time of applying the applicant would have to have been residing lawfully in the UK for at least 12 months continuously at some point in their life. Child victims of trafficking will invariably not be lawfully present in the UK</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> as they have been trafficked against their will for the purposes of exploitation in the UK.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">15. Child victims of trafficking require legal aid to challenge public authorities acting unlawfully, such as if a local authority does not comply with its dutie</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">s to the child, such as placing the child in unsuitable accommodation from which they might be retrafficked, even within the UK. This is of particular relevance to trafficked children who are highly vulnerable even after coming into contact with the local </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">authority or other agencies. It has been estimated that 60% of child victims of trafficking go missing from local authority care</span><a name="_ftnref9"></a><a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">, and many of these face retrafficking and exploitation. ECPAT UK has identified that there are no commonly agreed safety and p</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">rotection standards across the UK for the placement of children who are suspected or known to be trafficked</span><a name="_ftnref10"></a><a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">. This inconsistency has allowed safeguarding issues to be side-lined and, in some instances, cast aside, leading to further harm to the child. Thus</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">, the importance of accessing legal representation in order to secure safe and appropriate accommodation cannot be underestimated in light of the often-inadequate response of local authorities to respond to child victims.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">16. ECPAT UK is particularly </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">concerned about the effect this test would have on thousands of child victims of trafficking who are EEA nationals. In 2011, the UK Human Trafficking Centre identified 489 potential child victims of trafficking from 43 countries. Romanian children represen</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ted 20% of all child victims in the UK, with 9% from Slovakia and 2% from Bulgaria. For those EEA national children who are in the UK for a period of 12 continuous months are likely to be unable to provide evidence of this if they are victims of traffickin</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">g. It is a totally unworkable and unreasonable proposal to expect any child, particularly those who have been trafficked and exploited, to provide evidence of their lawful presence in this country. In any case and, as mentioned above, it will require colla</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ting evidence and, in EEA cases, will involve the individual child (or adult) showing that he or she satisfies the legal test for ‘lawful residence’ under EU law. This is a task that individuals require lawyers for. Such a burden should not be unfairly pla</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ced on those who are vulnerable and particularly those who had no choice whatsoever in their being present ‘unlawfully’ in the UK as a direct result of their trafficking experience. As such, the proposals will render thousands of EEA national child victims</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> of trafficking unable to access legal representation that they so urgently require as identified victims under the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (hereafter ‘the Trafficking Convention’) and the Trafficking Dire</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ctive. This would indirectly discriminate against EEA national children who will be disproportionately more likely to be affected than British nationals, which may contravene Community Treaty obligations.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">17. The current proposals offer an exception to the</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> residence test for asylum seekers. However, if an asylum-seeking child is granted refugee status, they would then have to wait another 12 months </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">following the grant of refugee status before becoming eligible again. The proposals would exclude those who ar</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">e failed asylum seekers. Some child victims of trafficking claim asylum in the UK but it is acknowledged that trafficking is not a ‘pure’ fit into the Refugee Convention 1951, which can make such cases very complex and requiring of quality immigration lawy</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ers. It is conceivable that those individuals who were trafficked as children, who fail to obtain asylum, will be unable to access legal aid and legal representation. This would affect children that find themselves in, unfortunately, common situations rega</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">rding lack of support turning 18. For instance, take the example of an unaccompanied asylum-seeking trafficked child who aged 17 successfully obtains refugee status while in the care of a local authority under Section 20 of the Children Act 1989. When the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">young person turns 18, the local authority unlawfully seeks to terminate their accommodation and support, instead of treating them as a care leaver. The young person would have to wait for 12 months after the date they were granted refugee status in order </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">to access legal aid to challenge the local authority, even if they were made homeless in the meantime. It appears that the current proposals place a disadvantage against refugees in comparison with British nationals in the equivalent position, in contraven</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">tion of Article 16 of the Refugee Convention 1951.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">18. Those child victims who do not claim asylum will not be able to get legal aid whatsoever (unless they are able to prove they have been lawfully resident for 12 months, which will be extremely unlikely</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> in most instances of child trafficking). </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">19. Any potential victim of trafficking who is in immigration detention who is in the UK unlawfully (as most trafficked children are) and who are age-disputed would not be eligible for legal aid for their detentio</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">n case, even if they are being detained unlawfully. Such proposals would severely restrict the child’s access to legal representation as a child victim of trafficking under the Trafficking Directive.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">20. Most child victims of trafficking are aged 16-17</span><a name="_ftnref11"></a><a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">. T</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">raffickers commonly seize a child’s identification documents or traffic the child on false or forged documents. Therefore, many children’s ages are disputed by the local authority, police or Home Office. In ECPAT UK’s experience, these children are often t</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">reated as adults because they are in possession of false documents appearing to make them an adult. For some, claiming asylum will not be the appropriate course for their immigration case. For others, the age dispute may only arise once they no longer fall</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> within the asylum-seeker exception, either because they have been granted refugee status and then have to wait for 12 months, or because they have been refused and have become a failed asylum-seeker (the process of assessing age within a local authority c</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">an take many months). ECPAT UK and its partners work with many children whose ages are unlawfully assessed and is extremely concerned that the proposals risk taking away the only effective remedy from those who do not meet the requirements of the residence</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> test. This could contravene Article 8 of the UNCRC, which determines a child’s right to an identity, of which age is a significant factor, particularly when ongoing support and protection may depend on such a decision. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">21. As ECPAT UK has identified abov</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">e, determining lawful residence will be extremely complex and challenging for lawyers, nevermind many individuals - and even more so for unaccompanied children and child victims of trafficking. The nature of the abuse suffered by victims of trafficking, al</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ong with mental health and disclosure issues, and language problems are likely to render it even more difficult for child victims of trafficking to be able to establish that they meet the test. It is ECPAT UK’s opinion that the residence test would be unwo</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">rkable and potentially dangerous in practice. Legal aid lawyers in the areas of law in question – such as community care, special education needs, negligence, family law – may not be able to accurately ascertain if someone is ‘lawfully present’. This </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">is of</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ten a far from straightforward issue and would be very difficult to prove. In many cases, the Home Office holds an individual’s passport and there is no immigration-checking service currently available to lawyers. Such challenges and potential misunderstan</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">dings could lead to foreign national children being discriminated against and an additional barrier to justice created. The human cost will be borne by the children. Denied access to legal representation and the possibility of being able to place trust and</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> confidence in a legal adviser and/or adults who will help to keep them safe, risks children facing further exploitation in the UK and ending up in the hands of traffickers once more. It also increases the risk of increased detention or removal to a countr</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">y of origin where again there are significant risks of destitution and retrafficking. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">22. There is also confusion about those children who are under 12 months old so cannot have been lawfully present in the UK for a continuous period. Such babies would b</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">e unable to get any civil legal aid. This is clearly discriminatory against all children under the age of one. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">23.  ECPAT UK is genuinely concerned that the pressure the residence test would put upon children could be damaging and severely restrict their </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ability to seek redress or justice when they are being treated unlawfully by public bodies. Currently, where this occurs, organisations such as ourselves step in to pressure local authorities and we frequently support lawyers in their legal challenges to l</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ocal authorities, police, the Home Office and others in order to secure appropriate justice for each child. We do not know where we would be able to turn if we are not able to refer children to lawyers to seek redress where they were being failed. We consi</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">der that the proposals are reckless to the risks that these children will face without specialist legal advice. We fear that this would place huge extra burdens on the charitable sector, who would ultimately be left to support vulnerable, often exploited, </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">children who had nowhere to turn. In the current times of austerity, to place such added financial and resource-intensive expectations on NGOs is immoral and will leave children exposed to unnecessary risk. This will ultimately not be cost-effective and wi</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ll, in some cases, place added strain on local authorities because of the ‘leakage’ to other areas, such as the prison service. While the cost savings of restricting legal aid via a residence test are wholly unknown to the government, as stated in Impact A</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ssessment MoJ194, the impact on children and those voluntary and statutory sector organisations supporting them (including local authorities) will be hugely significant. </span><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">24. Judicial review is an essential safeguard against public authorities acting unla</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">wfully and the primary means of challenging Government action. Some applications for judicial review are urgent and a case may need to be brought within hours/days with constantly evolving circumstances, for example, where a child victim of trafficking is </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">denied appropriate and secure accommodation, despite the significant risk of being retrafficked, often within days, if not hours. In complex cases, such as trafficking, the full picture is not immediately apparent and ECPAT UK fears lawyers may shy away fr</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">om these cases, despite their urgency, because the financial risk is too high and because it may be difficult to prove a suspected child victim of trafficking has been lawfully resident (if they haven’t claimed asylum). </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">25. ECPAT UK is concerned that the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">proposals will lead to a chilling effect discouraging lawyers from taking on such complex cases altogether, despite their importance, given the financial risks involved in taking on work without being paid unless permission is granted further along the lin</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">e. This would see firms that are well regarded and have developed specialism in areas closing down and reducing the availability of suitable and skilled lawyers to take on complex cases, such as those involving age assessments and trafficking. This would h</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ave a knock-on effect of a reduction in pro bono advice, on which many vulnerable clients depend. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">26. The vast majority of judicial review cases settle before the permission stage, which indicates the strength of a challenge and makes the threat of a lega</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">l challenge a vital tool in ensuring the safeguarding of children and holding public authorities to account. Children often do not understand their own situations and rely on lawyers to explain it and act upon concerns. To remove such a tool would put chil</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">dren at risk and hinder their access to their rights under the UNCRC and Trafficking Directive.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">27.

Take Child X who was trafficked to the UK as a child for cannabis cultivation. He was detained by the police and the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Crown Prosecution Service decided to prosecute for cannabis cultivation. Child X was imprisoned in an adult prison as his age was also disputed. Prison guards contact the local authority as they have concerns the young person is a child, but the local auth</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ority refuses to do an age assessment because the child’s visa, which is known to be forged, shows ‘proof of age’. Eventually, Child X is released but not accommodated by the local authority and left destitute. His age is eventually accepted but the local </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">authority fails to provide appropriate support given that the individual is a victim of trafficking and has mental health issues. The Home Office then attempts to remove the young person because it has records of the child being present in a third country,</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> and it refuses to accept the age assessment of the local authority so seeks to detain the young person under immigration powers. This is a real story of a real child in the UK. In this case, lawyers were able to assist the child to eventually challenge th</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">e authorities at each step of the way for failing to deliver what they are supposed to. The threat of a judicial review in this case was enough to make the local authority do an age assessment and to challenge the failure to provide protection and support.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> Without this crucial option, Child X would have faced more and extended risk and trauma without the ability to seek redress against the public authorities that are supposed to protect him and the hundreds of others like him.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">30. One of ECPAT UK’s main con</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">cerns with regard to the proposals on judicial review is the impact on those children going through the National Referral Mechanism (NRM). Under the NRM, there is no right of appeal for children or adults on decisions made by the Competent Authorities. Thi</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">s means that the only way to challenge such decisions is via a judicial review. There is only a 31% rate for children in the NRM obtaining Conclusive Grounds decisions, which is in itself worryingly low. In addition, there have been claims that discriminat</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ion exists within the decision-making process of the NRM</span><a name="_ftnref12"></a><a href="#_ftn12">[12]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">. Figures from 1 April 2009 to 30 June 2011 reveal that 88% of British children obtained a Conclusive Grounds decision, compared with 68% of children from Romania, 32% from Nigeria, 24% from Vietnam </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">and 17% from China.  Concerns about inconsistent and poor decision-making in the NRM, particularly by the UK Border Agency/Home Office, have been raised repeatedly and currently </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">the only way to challenge a bad decision is via judicial review. Yet under the</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> current proposals, there will be absolutely no way to appeal an NRM decision for many the many children that will not fit the asylum-seeker exception. This is clearly not compatible with the Trafficking Directive, which sets out the entitlement to support</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> and protection via the identification of child victims and could be unlawful. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">31. ECPAT UK knows that children’s cases often involve a significant wider public interest. It is important that cases involving significant novel points of law in relation to</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> children receive legal aid funding to test and develop the law in relation to children. It is vital for the upholding of children’s rights and the UK’s obligations to children and providers are able to take on difficult and complex challenges involving no</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">vel points of law. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">32. Trafficked children also stand to be negatively affected by cuts to legal aid for criminal cases. At the moment a suspect at the police station or someone in court on criminal charges has a choice of legal aid solicitor, so there is</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> an incentive for firms to provide a high quality service as they can always choose to go elsewhere. The proposals would mean contracts for the provision of criminal defence services would instead be awarded to the firm, or organisation, bidding to provide</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> it for the lowest price. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">33. The disincentive to provide a quality service that would result from the proposed changes would be especially detrimental to those who need specialist attention, like young people trafficked into the country. Guidance issued</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> to the Crown Prosecution Service suggests child victims of trafficking should not be prosecuted for committing crimes that they were forced into as a result of their status, but there will inevitably be times where this guidance, or the child’s status, is</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> missed by the law enforcement agency. In many cases the responsibility will fall to the criminal solicitor to identify the status of their client as a trafficked child and put forward legal arguments for the prosecution to be dropped. With the proposed ch</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">anges meaning that only the bare minimum of work will be done on each case, there is a huge risk that it will be impossible to meet these responsibilities, as too little time will be spent with the client discussing background information for the child’s s</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">tatus to be identified. The lack of choice will mean that a child who has been poorly represented will no longer be able to change solicitors to a firm more willing to fight for their interests.
