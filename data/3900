font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">It is very much dependent upon the culture of procurement officers within particular local authorities.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Where there is an effective strategic relationship between procurement and economic development, in particular within local authorities, that is where procurement leads to wider benefits.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:11pt">, low skills, poor business sustainability and those sorts of concerns, i.e. where there is a culture of achieving wider benefits through the process of procurement.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Oliver Henman</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: At NCVO, we understand that local authorities are facing a challenging economic environment.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Funding for services is decreasing while demand is increasing.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">This does change the balance of what can be funded and what cannot be funded.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">However, in these tough conditions, more effective procurement would enable the resources that are available to be better targeted.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">It is important to involve community organisations early in the process, even pre</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">-</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">procurement, in order to identify the needs of a local area and make sure resources are best used for that area.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';

font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Macfarlane</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: Political leadership is key, because it tells officers this is a high priority on the long agenda of things they have to deal with: re</span><span style="font-family:Calibri;

font-size:11pt">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">, which are the cities I have been working in, political leadership is key to saying, “This is something we have to take forward and are going to take forward”.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The officers then get their ducks in line and start to work out how to do it and where to do it and so forth.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The first thing—a bit like we went through with John—is you have to present the argument to them in a logical way that overcomes their fears and concerns about European rules and so forth.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri;

font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The danger of jointly purchasing is that contracts get bigger and bigger, and that becomes more difficult in another way for SMEs and small firms that traditionally provided services to bid.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">However, there is some evidence—it is harder to quantify—from members to say that the ability to refer to the right to challenge allows them to begin a conversation with the council that they would not otherwise have been able to begin.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Although we have only seen 22 actual formal processes, it may be the case that in other cases people are raising particular needs and the councils are responding less formally, rather than going through a full right to challenge.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The evidence we have is that the right to challenge is sometimes seen as creating unnecessary confrontation.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri;

font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">One of the questions was, “How big is your support organisation?” rather than, “Is it appropriate for the size of the tender that you are bidding for?”</span><span style="font-family:Calibri;

font-size:11pt">-</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">linear, which can create issues for a buyer, when they are setting up the tender, to understand how a scoring mechanism is going to react and, from the supplier side, to understand what is going to happen when you apply for a tender.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">They were also not able to take account of innovation during the tender procedure, which is where you can create real value for local councils.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Ultimately, these kinds of onerous procedures can put SMEs off tendering; they can take up a lot of time and money; and they can actually put some SMEs out of business.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">You also get issues with aggregation of requirements and framework agreements, which can also remove SMEs from tendering for these kinds of opportunities.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">I know we are going to discuss some of that later.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri;

that is what is going to happen.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">That is for the procurers.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri;
