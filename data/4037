The Programme is a good example of how the skills, experience and knowledge of different teams across the Department can be brought together to deliver a complex programme and can be allocated to ensure a priority policy area is successfully and safely delivered.

However, we anticipate that the running costs of the NPS will be c. 400m per annum. The costs to NOMS of managing future contracts will be cost neutral. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="color:#0000ff; font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">Estates</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt">We can confirm that the current annual budget for properties that make up the public probation estate is £91.8m (including depreciation). When the new Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) and National Probation Service (NPS) are created, staff will all remain in the properties within which they currently work. It is expected that in many cases this will mean properties are shared between the NPS and CRCs. As now, properties will remain the responsibility of MoJ Estate Directorate.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt">In the longer term, future arrangements will depend on the operating models of the future CRC owners as selected through the competition, and because of the exact cost of exiting properties is currently unknown.</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt"> Furthermore, the exact detail of how property will be offered to the CRCs through the competition is still being determined and therefore, for commercial reasons, we are unable to release figures relating to the Department ceasing to use them. We anticipate that, to aid transition, CRCs will be provided with (and be required to pay for) space in the existing MoJ probation properties until the end of December 2015. The charge will cover all day to day property running costs, such as rent, utilities, Facilities Management services and also property ownership costs incurred by MoJ, such as maintenance, insurance and depreciation and that these arrangements will be incorporated into the contract with the new owners of the CRCs following competition.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">Resettlement Services</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt">As you are aware, in support of the Transforming Rehabilitation reforms, NOMS is realigning the prison estate, designating a small number of resettlement prisons for each CRC area, which will release the vast majority of offenders to that area. CRCs will work in resettlement prisons in their Contract Package Area (CPA), delivering a resettlement service for every offender before release (including for offenders who will be managed by the NPS). This will provide them with the opportunity to engage with the offenders they will manage before release, both in the course of providing the resettlement service and to provide additional “through the gate” rehabilitation support to those offenders if they wish to do so. Prisons will facilitate this engagement.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt">As a consequence of the way that prisons are allocated their budgets and are able to allocate some of their resources autonomously, a central figure covering the cost of resettlement services across the prison estate is not held. Prisons currently hold a number of contracts which cover resettlement services that in the future will be provided by CRCs. The current contracts are for a variety of geographical areas, lengths and services and therefore do not necessarily reflect the resettlement services that will be provided under the new system.</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">Voluntary Redundancy</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt">As was discussed during the meeting last Tuesday, as a consequence of there not being full endorsement of the Staff Transfer and Protection Agreement we were unable to offer the element of the deal to harmonise the terms for Voluntary Redundancy for staff at 67.5 weeks (honouring the terms in place for a trust which has a scheme in place which exceed this). Furthermore, we were willing to write the agreement on enhanced Voluntary Redundancy terms into the commercial contracts as part of the share sale. However, Voluntary Redundancy terms are a matter which require collective agreement and without this it is not possible to provide the enhanced Voluntary Redundancy terms we had initially planned.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt">However, the Ministry of Justice has budgeted for the funding of any redundancy package should this position change.

Where a Trust is projecting an under spend for 13/14 we expect transition costs to be met initially from that under spend, and we currently anticipate that we will not use the majority of the money we have allocated for this purpose. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><br style="page-break-before:always; clear:both" /></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">ICT</span><br /><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt">The Department’s current ICT infrastructure will be modified to support the sharing of information with a number of different providers, taking into account the data requirements to deliver the service, and any data security implications. National Delius (nDelius) will be used as the case management tool by the NPS. It is intended that this application will be used as the central repository for information about all offenders who will be subject to supervision in the community.

There may be an additional burden to the police from extending supervision in the community to offenders released from custodial sentences of less than 12 months, as police time will be needed to deal with offenders who fail to comply with the conditions of supervision. Our initial estimate is that this could cost up to £5m per year. The Impact Assessment also contains an assessment of extending drug testing to Class B drugs and requiring offenders to attend drug treatment. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt">I hope that this information will be useful to you and your Committee colleagues in further understanding some of the details of the Transforming Rehabilitation Programme.</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">December 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
