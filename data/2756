A number of the points that I raised during that session are also applicable to the committee's current inquiry into passenger tra</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt; letter-spacing:-0.3pt">nsport in isolated communities and this letter is intended to highlight and expand on the issues that are particularly pertinent.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt; letter-spacing:-0.3pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt; letter-spacing:-0.3pt">Action on Hearing Loss is the UK's largest membership charity supporting people who are deaf or hard of hearing. We're expert</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt; letter-spacing:-0.3pt">s in providing support for people with hearing loss and tinnitus and provide day-to-day care for people who are deaf and have additional needs.

Whilst people with hearing loss will plan and approach their journey in the same way as a</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt; letter-spacing:-0.3pt">ny other passenger, challenges occur when things change during that journey and when changes are not communicated accurately, immediately and visually.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt; letter-spacing:-0.3pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt; letter-spacing:-0.3pt">A minor change, such as a platform alteration or a delayed connection, can very quickly become a major </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt; letter-spacing:-0.3pt">situation for someone with hearing loss left unaware of the situation and unable to adapt to it. In instances where transport provision is already limited, not being able to access accurate information about journey alterations can be particularly problema</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt; letter-spacing:-0.3pt">tic. Real-time visual information displays (on trains, buses and throughout stations) are invaluable for people with hearing loss, but we know that the use of these systems varies widely across the transport network. A lack of real-time visual information </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt; letter-spacing:-0.3pt">at rural bus stops, for example, can be a real hindrance to someone with hearing loss setting out on a journey with confidence.For buses and coaches, the Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations do not currently include a requirement for audio-vis</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt; letter-spacing:-0.3pt">ual information systems. As such, some communities, including those in rural and isolated locations, do not have consistent access to audio-visual systems on local bus services to convey travel details and information about any unscheduled journey changes.</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt; letter-spacing:-0.3pt"> The `iBus' system currently in operation on all London buses represents a model of good practice for this type of system.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt; letter-spacing:-0.3pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt; letter-spacing:-0.3pt">Your inquiry is also looking at demand responsive transport services.
