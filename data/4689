My name is Chris Faulkner. I am the CEO of Breitling Energy. We are now in our 10th year in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> of onshore, lower 48 states, unconventional oil and gas development, utilising hydraulic fracture stimulation. Over those 10 years, the company has switched from natural gas to liquids, as the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has made the transition towards what we call light tight oil production. As shale gas production in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has reached a 100 year-plus supply, it is very difficult in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> currently to produce gas economically at the price point, down from $15 to $4, so as a company now we are using fracture stimulation to generate oil production.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> That is excellent.

You have mentioned the history of your company, but could you outline briefly the history of the development of the shale gas industry in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and how important a source of energy it is for the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Chris Faulkner</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The terminology they use now in the media is that there is a shale gas revolution. I would caution against using the term “revolution” unless it is predicated by the term “evolution”, because about 20 years’ worth of development work went into understanding how to unlock this trapped hydrocarbon in very tight rock known as shale.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The real turning point in all of this was some time after the turn of the century, before 2005. What happened was a combination of two pre-existing technologies. One was horizontal drilling, going sideways through the rock and being able to steer the drill bit, and combining that with a technique that had been utilised for almost 80 years in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> called hydraulic fracture stimulation, now known as fracking. The original test was done in an area where I currently live—the Barnett shale, in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Fort Worth</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Texas</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—by a man by the name of George Mitchell. The Mitchell Energy company took those two techniques, combined them and—lo and behold—unlocked what is now considered to be the biggest potential shale natural gas basin on the planet, right in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Dallas</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Fort Worth</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In 2005 the United States was still forecast to be a major, major importer of natural gas, the biggest on the planet—about 56 trillion cubic feet every single year. Excuse me—it was 56 billion cubic feet—bcf; I was thinking about you guys using three and a half. That import forecast was done by the very smartest economists we had. They had a similar forecast until 2009. At the same time, what they did not comprehend was the impact of the industry’s development of shale gas. By 2009 those forecasts had dropped to very near to zero, and the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has subsequently become a net exporter of distillate fuels and, potentially, natural gas. It is now on the eve of being an LNG exporter.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The reality is that, within half a decade, it turned our environment of energy up on its ear. Now we have about 100-plus years’ worth of supply on the conservative side. Some guys in the industry say 200 years, but I always stick with the conservative number of one century’s worth of natural gas supply.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q223 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What would it have been before?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Chris Faulkner</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It would have been none—we would have been an importer. We built these terminals to import gas from Qatar, similar to what you guys do today. We were going to be an importer, and they were going to be an exporter to us, but those terminals never got off the ground because they were built during the same time as we became a massive natural gas producer. Today those terminals are being converted to export, as we are on the eve of becoming an exporter of natural gas. In our country now, it has reduced the cost of electricity, has allowed us to lower our greenhouse gas emissions by displacing coal and has given us an opportunity to switch a lot of our transportation on the large fleet side to natural gas. So there are a lot of benefits coming from this domestic natural gas boom.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q224 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Williams:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The prime motivation behind this inquiry is the impact that this has on </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Wales</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and, perhaps more generally, on the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’s energy needs. We have heard evidence that tens </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">of thousands of wells would be required in order to drill economically for shale gas in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. What is your experience of those kinds of figures—tens of thousands of wells—in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Chris Faulkner</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I would be cautious. You do not have to mimic the success of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, to the degree that, as we speak today, we have 1,750 drilling rigs running in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, with the majority now drilling for—let us just call it—oil. As a whole, there are 1,750 rigs running in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. We have drilled 150,000 unconventional shale gas or tight oil wells—a tremendous amount—but we have to take into consideration that technology has now pushed this industry further along, so we are able to do more with less. I think there have been 40 wells drilled over here in total. Obviously, something lower than tens of thousands and higher than 40 is going to be the number by which we can establish commercial production.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">As you know, the reason we have had to drill that many wells is that the wells decline very rapidly. In layperson’s terms, when the fracture stimulation occurs, the rock is cracked open and little beads—let us call them sand or ceramic pebbles; they are very small—go into the earth. The pressure is released and the earth closes up, but it now has very tiny fissures by which gas can escape and go into the wellbore. Because of the pressures and the weight of the earth, it pushes on those and they close back up and begin hyperbolically to decline, so you lose the majority of the production after the third year. What we have realised now as a country is that there is a massive amount of gas that still comes—what we call the tail of that production—so that once it declines it extends for a very long period of time, say, 20 years.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">As an industry, we are trying to grow our production exponentially; keeping production flat and growing production are two different stories. A tremendous number of wells will have to be drilled, but that does not mean that one well is drilled off one pad and you move down the road. We can now drill 24 or 30 wells from one single five-acre pad site. We do not have to keep moving the rig any more.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q225 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Williams:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You have predicted my next question, which is about the five-acre pad. What effect does population density have on the capacity to drill in any given area? Population density in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is very different from what it is in parts of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. What kind of challenges does that present?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Chris Faulkner</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We can look at an example from the Barnett shale. The Barnett sits beneath a very large metropolitan city—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Dallas</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Fort Worth</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Texas</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. With directional drilling, we can drill from </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">3,000 metres</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> away in any particular direction, so I would not say that we have to set a rig in the middle of a dense area. There are areas we can drill from and directionally to, in multiple different directions.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We have drilled under the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">university</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Texas</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> at </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Arlington</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, underneath downtown </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Fort Worth</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and underneath hospitals and schools. DFW airport signed one of the largest royalty programmes—they are not contracts—with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Chesapeake</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, which drills underneath runways and terminals in an area where obviously safety is very important. You cannot think of it like in the old days, when you would set up the rig and drill straight beneath it. The reality is that technology now allows us to reach very distant areas.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q226 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Williams:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The caricature that some of us have in our mind is that it is a vertical drilling exercise.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Chris Faulkner</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: That is how this was all done until, basically, half a decade ago. We still drill vertical wells in the United States, in the Permian basin, but most of them are now directional or horizontally drilled. Keep in mind that, with what we call measurement while drilling or MWD, or logging while drilling or LWD, you can steer these wellbores almost like a worm, so you can directionally steer them any way that you want. The technology has really pushed this forward. I would not use population density as a crutch to stymie the development of shale gas.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q227 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Mr Faulkner, everyone wants to ask you a question on this.

More importantly, people from all over the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> have moved to these areas to get jobs because, as you know, as in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, we have had an economic meltdown.

The EIA released the energy outlook report yesterday. One of the underlying themes, which the media are finally starting to take hold of, is that $71 billion in industrial plants in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> are being built, have been permitted or are being discussed to be invested in.

When you look at places like Grangemouth, INEOS and those big factories that employ 170,000 or 175,000 people, the idea that we have natural gas at a third—if not less—of what you guys have, and a fourth of what Asia has, creates an opportunity in America for us to be a black hole to pull industry back to our country, because, out of the gate, we make industry more competitive with the abundance of natural gas.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q242 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jessica Morden:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Moving on to the impact on local communities, can you describe the kind of disruption a community might experience from drilling?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Chris Faulkner</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: If you are not using pad drilling—if you are putting up one well site, drilling one horizontal well and having to move on to the next location, as we have had to do in America, because we have policies in which we have to hold the acreage for landowners by drilling a well—it takes 1,000 trucks in and 1,000 trucks out to mobilise and demobilise a rig, with the water, the flowback and all of that, so there are a lot of trucks. That reduces significantly if you do not have to move the rig because you are pad drilling.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Things that concern communities are noise, dust and truck traffic on roads.

There are ways to limit that, but those will be the initial concerns. In a lot of these areas, the roads are not phenomenal.

The reality is that we use vapour recovery units to capture methane emissions, which is what people talk about around these drill sites. Our production has gone up by 40%, and our methane emissions have gone down by 20% at the same time, so obviously progress is being made utilising technology. The biggest complaints that I get personally—I do not know whether I am speaking for the entire industry—are about noise and sound. We take sound readings around our drill locations.

I will tell you the key to this whole thing. It is not an argument about whether the process of fracking is safe or whether the procedure is safe. The reality is that it boils down to one single thing—wellbore integrity and regulation. If you drill a good well, have good cement and have regulation to monitor the water off as you are drilling, there is no issue with the process.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Keep in mind that whether you frack the well or not, you still drill through the water aquifer.

Whether you are fracking or not, you are still drilling through the aquifer—you still have to protect the aquifer from drilling mud and from hydrocarbon coming back out of the ground.

The idea of fracking has been created because people were scared of natural gas, not because of fracking, which is the vehicle to unlock natural gas.

The reality is that, if you research the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, it will disprove that theory. “Gasland” came out in 2008. Since the ’30s in that area reports have been filed with the water department that people can light their taps on fire. Kids in schools used to light the water faucet on fire, long before fracking was ever utilised. The reality is that it occurs from naturally occurring methane—what we call biogenic methane—in the water. That occurs in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United Kingdom</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> as well. There are natural shale deposits of methane, which can migrate to the surface and get into a water aquifer.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Two things happened with that image. First, Josh Fox failed to mention the fact that there was a history of being able to do that. He failed to mention that it was from biogenic methane, not fracking. He also failed to mention that that landowner had drilled the water well way too deep, way beneath what was the permitted depth of about </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">650 feet</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. He drilled to darn near </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">1,000 feet</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and came into connection with the pockets of methane. So I would not go back and say that it has to do with fracking.

When I was speaking with you, I talked about creating an environment by setting regulation and then allowing competition to generate a private, competitive industry. The missing piece is that companies have to understand what they are on the hook for. This whole moving target of regulation scares people. This is not something where someone will come and invest $10 million. If we are going to drill 1,000 wells in the United Kingdom, at a cost of probably $10 million or more per well, you are talking about $1 billion that will be invested—and that is on the low side. Most of these plays take $500 million to $5 billion to develop to commercial production.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We have to create an environment where regulation protects citizens and protects industry, it is laid out clearly so they understand that, and they can then feel comfortable about investing the money. The reality is that you have two roads to go down: an opportunity to create domestic supply that helps supplement or diversify the other supplies coming into the country; or an opportunity to continue to be a massive importer of oil and gas and to ignore the resource beneath your feet. There is also the potential opportunity that the gas gets cut off and that this winter becomes a challenge for some folks. Last year we came within six hours of that happening.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I also caution you that—as I am sure many of you in this room know—Qatargas and Centrica have a contract that has no exclusivity to it and Qatar can ship cargoes of LNG to anywhere it wants, to the highest bidder.

You have a huge resource. The responsibility as a country is for us to find some way of moving forward with it. That does not mean that windmills and solar are going away. I believe they feel that is the case—that it is us or them. The reality is that all of us have to come together if we are going to have a sustainable economy.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:14.2pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I will bring in Nia Griffiths now.

Secondly, “earthquakes”—let us put quotes around that—in a 2.0 range occur 1.3 million times a year on this planet. It is unfortunate that we did not talk about the other 1,299,998. We talked about—and made a huge deal about—the two that occurred in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Blackpool</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, but this occurs 1.3 million times.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Why don’t we talk about that?

You need to keep in mind that renewables require some kind of base load form of energy if you are going to use them for power generation because, very simply put, the technology does not </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">work today. If we can figure out a way to store renewable energy, we will have a different conversation, but until we do, there has to be stand-by power, unless you guys do not want to have the lights and heat on during certain parts of the year. No one will be foolish enough to say that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Take </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Germany</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, for example, and the fact that Merkel wants to shut down nuclear and move to a renewable energy programme, which is great. The reality is that they have accomplished nil as far as renewable energy development goes. They are now having to go back and turn on coal-fired power plants and, even worse, lignite power plants, which are 30% dirtier than coal. So I would caution you about that. I believe our Government said earlier this year that it will be 50 years before renewable energy technology works in a manner that allows for its widespread use. The cost of that is staggering. It requires subsidies. In </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Germany</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, it requires an increase of 14% in energy bills to help fund the research and development of energy.

You cannot have 100% windmill and solar power and not have some stand-by energy. Again, I am not saying that this is going to replace that. The puzzle still includes all of these things. We also have to address whatever is left of nuclear and coal, because this will not be an all-or-nothing scenario. I do not know any model or anyone who will tell you that renewables can power 100% of the planet. This might even include Greenpeace. It has a zero-hydrocarbon mentality, but it has no plan to get there. The reality is that renewables, nuclear and coal will be in the puzzle, but it has to be considered at all levels.

They might have one well on them—or possibly two—at the exploration stage. When you get to production—as with some of the wells that I have seen in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Texas</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—you might have a very large number of wells.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The added complication in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is that because the Bowland shale is particularly thick—it is about a mile thick, whereas most shale plays in the States are a few hundred metres thick—you can frack and do a number of different stages at different levels. In theory, you could have a significant number of wells on a pad—the industry has talked in terms of 10 to 20 wells on a pad—so you do not need to think in terms of thousands of locations. You can think in terms of a number of locations, each with a significant number of wells.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q266 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Williams:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I was going to ask you about that. The previous evidence session tempered this question somewhat, given the possibilities for the size of pads. Have the Government made any decisions about the maximum size and scale of projects—the drilling operations that can be allowed—or, as you suggested, is it very much related to the ease with which the shale gas can be extracted? At the root of this, I suppose, is the fact that some of us are concerned—or concern has been expressed; let us put it that way—about the mass industrialisation of the countryside. Glyn and I are well versed in this in terms of wind farms in our part of mid and west </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Wales</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. How are we going to avoid the mass industrialisation of the countryside?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Duarte</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold"> Figueira</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: At the planning stage, normally a development application would be made. That would specify the production stage. I must emphasise that, as I think you heard in the last session, we will not reach production for some time to come. We will go through an exploration phase for the next two or three years. That will have a number of wells—perhaps 20 to 40 or 30 to 40, the industry has said. There will then be an appraisal stage, at which people make decisions about whether they want to invest, on the basis of well flows and the appraisal of the exploration phase. Then you will start to see a ramp-up of production, probably with full at-scale production in the early 2020s, on the assumption that the shale can be recovered economically and technically.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There is nothing in planning law that limits the size of a shale development. The production shale pads I have seen in Texas in the States were perhaps two or three times the size of an exploration pad, so you might be talking about 2 to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">3 hectares</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, or two or three rugby pitches—a rugby pitch is about 0.8 of a hectare. So that is the sort of size you are talking about.

Notwithstanding the work that the Assembly Government are doing with their geological survey, how can we ensure that Wales gets its fair crack of the whip if sufficient amounts of deposits do indeed exist?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Michael Fallon</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We have been working with the Welsh Government to make sure they understand the process that we have in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. Some of these regulatory steps apply across </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Wales</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. As I shall be explaining at 12 o’clock, there is a very clear regulatory process now—a five-stage process. First, you have to have a licence. We are widening the licence area in the south of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Wales</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, slightly, and in the north of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Wales</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. Then you have to have planning permission from the local planning authority in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Wales</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. You have to have the necessary environmental permits from the Welsh body concerned. You have to have consent for your drilling operation and the construction of your well from the Health and Safety Executive. Finally, you have to come back to my Department for a consent.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">So there is a five-stage process, which will apply slightly differently in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Wales</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, but it is there for </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Wales</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> as for </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. Given the activity there has already been onshore, particularly in the south of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Wales</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, in all kinds of extraction, I would have thought there was quite a lot of interest and potential in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Wales</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. There are already some 23 licences out there. We know there are half a dozen operators in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Wales</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. I am pretty confident that, if all this potential is really there, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Wales</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> will be involved in it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q268 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Williams:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Finally, the Government announced in the autumn statement the intention to introduce tax breaks for shale gas companies. When do the Government intend to do that? Could you briefly tell us the motivation behind doing so?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Michael Fallon</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes. These are not tax breaks. The taxation of oil and gas is at a much higher rate than for any other commercial activity. Typically, it is taxed at around 62%, whereas at the moment most corporation tax is 23%. For certain types of exploration—more difficult fields or whatever—there are different allowances, which bring that rate down from 62%. In the case of onshore exploration, it is coming down to 30%, but it is still much higher than the normal rate of corporation tax. So I have to take issue with your phrase “tax break”—these companies will be paying more tax than companies involved in other industrial activities. None the less, for a portion of their profits, they will be exempted from the 62% rate and their rate will be 30%.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That is because it will take them a very long time to make any kind of return on the capital they are going to invest. The time scales involved are probably longer than for exploration in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">North sea</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. There is no quick buck here. It may well take them many years to make a profit on their operations. The allowances that we are putting in place—they apply immediately from next April—will, I hope, incentivise exploration, but they will not bring it anywhere close to normal commercial activity. They will still be very heavily taxed on the gas or, indeed, the oil they bring up.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q269 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Can I take you back to that? It is a question I wanted to ask earlier. In one of the background evidence reports that we had, one fracking expert from the US said that one well would produce 10 billion cubic feet of gas, which equated to 3 TWh of electricity, but that one well could have 10 spin-offs on the same site. I am sorry that this is a bit complicated, but it was a fascinating calculation. So the 10 would equal 100 billion cubic feet, which would equal 30 TWh, which at 60% efficiency would be 18 TWh of electricity, which is just about the same as the entire British wind industry produces at the moment. The point that this person was making was that one frack pad on </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">5 acres</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> of land, which is about four football fields, could produce as much electricity as every single wind farm, onshore and offshore, in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. It looked reasonable on paper. Do you think that is a reasonable estimate?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Michael Fallon</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I am not sure about direct comparisons like that. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Duarte</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> may want to comment, but what has revolutionised the extraction of shale in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has been the evolution of horizontal drilling, whereby from one pad you may go 3,000 or </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">4,000 feet</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> down. If you went 3,000 or </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">4,000 feet</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> down here, you would be drilling out as far as Oxford Circus or Vauxhall or whatever. You could be drilling in dozens of different directions in spokes from a single pad to extract the gas. That is what has revolutionised the volumes that can be brought up in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. Of course, that has huge advantages, in that you are minimising the disruption on the surface.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q270 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jonathan Edwards:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> How will the gas be transported from the wells?

This year we approved an exemption from the normal licensing regime to make it easier for them to do that. I have not seen any proposals that would involve putting power stations next to the shale. In other countries that is being considered. I saw that being considered in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Brazil</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, where they also have shale, but it is in rather remote areas and is much further away from where they need the gas, so they are putting power stations beside it. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Duarte</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> may want to comment on the technical transmission aspects.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Duarte Figueira</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: You may have had evidence to the effect that one of the great advantages of the UK compared with, say, the US—in this respect, at least—is that we have a much more developed grid network much closer to where the activity is actually happening. Some of the districts in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Texas</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> are half the size of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, so that means the gas grid is much less developed.

We can see the need for the shale industry across the European Union to be clearer about the steps that it needs to take to explore and then to extract. We are clarifying that here, but there are a number of European laws involved and so on. We can see the need to clarify the guidance so that it knows exactly where it stands. What we do not see any need for is new legislation, which could take two or three </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">years to go through the European process. I think it would create more uncertainty and could well delay the investment we need. We do not think it is right that other member states that are ideologically opposed to one form of energy or another—whether it is nuclear, shale or whatever—should be able to stop a member state that does want to get on and develop it, where we have a very robust system of environmental protections already in place.

Therefore, that would create quite a large increase in the amount of gas within the European area. By the law of economics, that increase ought to result in a fall in price, ought it not?

So we face a problem with gas, which is that we are going to be increasingly dependent on imports of LNG or imports through the pipelines and, therefore, subject to very volatile international prices. We have a very strong interest in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United Kingdom</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, if there is shale gas here and it can be extracted easily, in getting it out and seeing whether it can indeed have the same economic impact.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q275 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I may be veering off topic a little bit here, but is it also the case that the Fukushima disaster, which resulted in Japan deciding to close its nuclear power stations, has had a direct impact on the UK, because it is one of the reasons why a lot of LNG that was coming into Wales, mainly, is now being diverted off to Japan, which is now much more dependent on LNG than it was previously?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Michael Fallon</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: These are the swirling currents of international markets.

That had a number of scenarios for what the price impacts might be of development of shale around the world. There were three scenarios, but there was one scenario in it where, if there is significant development of shale in Europe, if there is export of shale from the US—we are now starting to see the applications for that to happen—and if there is development of shale in China, collectively that will have a positive impact on reducing prices. That report is available.

There are some slightly different bodies involved, but I would not necessarily characterise the Welsh Government’s approach as more precautionary than that of the United Kingdom Government.

The Department for Communities and Local Government issued planning guidance for English local authorities in July 2013. We have had some evidence from people that suggested that the Welsh Government are negligent in not producing a technical advice note to Welsh local authorities taking decisions on shale gas. I do not want to tempt you to get involved in a spat between Welsh local authorities and the Welsh Government, but how important is that technical note guidance to local authorities as they digest potential planning applications before them?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Michael Fallon</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is certainly helpful for local authorities in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. I am not sure whether there is a strong case for replicating it in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Wales</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">; I think that has been mentioned. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Duarte</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, do you want to come in on that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Duarte</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold"> Figueira</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The point about the guidance that was produced by the CLG in July is that it was not new policy. All it really did was bring together in one place all the guidance that previously existed and clarify it for onshore oil and gas—it is wider than unconventional oil and gas. Essentially, it is a bringing together and brigading for operators.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">One of the things that it highlighted was that planning authorities—a lot of the guidance is directed at planning authorities as well as developers—should assume that the regulators, whether they are the Environment Agency in the case of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, or the HSE, which covers the whole </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, are able to assess the impacts they are particularly concerned with.

As the Minister has already said, there are some little changes—little differences—that sometimes relate to different legislation and so on, but essentially the regime is very similar in all the countries. We have worked very closely with them on that. When that is published and announced today by the Minister, you will see—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q283 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Williams:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Notwithstanding what you have just said—I think that regime is very clear—would you suggest to our colleagues that, none the less, a tool such as the clear guidance that has been given to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> would be useful to Welsh local authorities?

Basically my question is this: is it the UK Government’s policy to try to ensure that energy prices are lower than they are at the moment?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Michael Fallon</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is certainly our policy, where we can, to keep bearing down on energy prices, which is why we have looked at those bits of the bill the Government are responsible for—the so-called green levies. You will recall the announcement last month that we expect to reduce those by around £50 a head. One of my jobs as a Minister in both DECC and the Department for Business is to be constantly on the case to ensure that our industry remains competitive—competitive not just in the European Union but competitive globally. Of course, high energy costs are issues that certain industries complain about—the steel industry, the chemical industry, the paper industry, ceramics and pottery, and so on. Certainly for the chemical industry, there is real potential if we can extract shale that happens to be close to it; there is some shale, for example, in the north-west of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and on Teesside. If shale can be extracted relatively close to some of our chemical processes, there is an obvious opportunity for it to be a cheaper feedstock gas, but we are a long way away from that at the moment.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q285 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes, but you would agree in general terms that it would be a good thing if we could reduce energy costs in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United Kingdom</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Michael Fallon</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Certainly—absolutely.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q286 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Glyn Davies:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I have a question that has occurred to me from news items. They are happening all the time about shale gas because it is a developing industry. There are people who are ideologically opposed to the development of any fossil fuel at all; clearly shale gas is one of those. It is always a case of, “It won’t reduce prices anyway” because of the European network that we talked about earlier, but what about when the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> starts exporting gas to here? I read in the last couple of days that Grangemouth is considering importing shale gas from </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">America</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. That price will not be controlled by a European network at all—or will it? Will that be a price that is set by the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> price? It is bound to bring the price down if it will completely undercut what might be produced here in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Britain</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Michael Fallon</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes. The Grangemouth situation is quite complex, as I understand it. The type of ethane they need is running down in the North sea and they need to be sure they can get sufficient supplies of it, but of course it is now much cheaper in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.

It is generally reckoned that the costs of offshore shale gas and shale oil development would be of a significant order above those for onshore.

Some of them are for conventional oil and conventional gas. Others are for coal-bed methane extraction. Others are for vented gas and so on.

The normal application process for licences involves an operator coming directly to DECC, so DECC is responsible for the licensing process there. We will have to come back to you with a note on whom DECC might consult in that process, but my understanding is that essentially it involves an operator talking to the licensing authority at that stage.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In the case of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Wales</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, the other stages the Minister talked about are largely devolved.

I completely understand the need for commercial confidentiality, but in general terms I wondered what the business plan was. If a company—let us be honest, these are companies we have not normally heard of; they are not usually the big five, such as BP, Total and Shell—comes along, pays money for a licence and finds that there is exploitable shale, does it automatically have some right to exploit that, provided that it can get the planning consents, or is there some other kind of bidding process that would allow one of the big companies to come along and make money off the back of its exploration? How does it actually make a buck? It will cost it quite a few million just to drill down and find out whether there is shale there. How does it ensure there is a good chance it will get a return on that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Michael Fallon</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It has exclusivity for the licence area it is drilling in. What happened in the States was that fairly soon the larger companies let the smaller companies take a lot of the risk and do a lot of the exploring, and then tended to come in behind them and start buying up the smaller companies that had the more productive licences. It is very early days yet, but what is interesting is that we have already seen a couple of the majors getting involved in this. I think Centrica is already involved, with a stake in one of the companies; GDF Suez has taken a stake in one of the others.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The majors—the big oil and gas companies—are certainly taking a very close interest in it, but you have put your finger on something very important. There are huge risks in this business—you can spend millions and millions of pounds and not hit oil or gas. There is a very long lead time, and you may make no money at all. That is why it is important to have a certain fiscal incentive in place.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q292 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So you would foresee that most of these companies doing the exploration—I think you gave a figure of about 25—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Michael Fallon</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There are 23 licences out there.

There has been a concentration of some of the companies, but we will have to see. These are very early days here, so we are reliant on a handful of companies—perhaps a dozen companies across the UK—that are out there and are prepared to risk their capital and to get on with the exploration. It is very important that they are encouraged to do that if we are to unlock the potential of shale here.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Duarte</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold"> Figueira</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The Americans have the expression “wildcatters” for the group of companies that went in and did the initial work in the various basins.
