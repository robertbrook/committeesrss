The Cluster has long had an interest in seeing marine protected areas properly managed and adequately funded.  It first commissioned self-funded research four years ago which examined the lessons that could be drawn from experience elsewhere in Europe and internationally.  The cluster sponsored a conference on the subject and has followed this up with a case study looking at the British Indian Ocean Territory MPA and a seminar on the future funding of marine conservation. We, therefore, welcome the Committee’s enquiry.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:140%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:140%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Summary of main points</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; line-height:140%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:11pt">The announcement of the 27 new MCZs is a welcome further step in protecting and enhancing the marine environment off our shores, but leaves considerable uncertainty about the future management of the sites and how users will be affected.</span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; line-height:140%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:11pt">Simple and concise management plans should be prepared quickly for each site and these should form part of a wider MPA management implementation plan.

However, whilst it touched on the management measures and who might be affected it was very light on detail.  The success of the MCZs in delivering their objectives will rest on the effectiveness of the management measures and the scientific monitoring undertaken to ensure that the designated features, habitats and species are being adequately protected.  </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt;

By engaging all interested parties – or at least affording them the opportunity – it should be possible to ensure, as far as possible, that the objectives of the sites can be achieved at minimum disruption and cost to business and leisure users.  However, some displacement of users (e.g. fishing vessels) and additional cost to individuals is inevitable.  There will be winners and losers. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:140%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:11pt">One of the present difficulties for both the responsible authorities and external stakeholders is the web of different responsibilities. Whilst management plans should reflect local expertise and need, there should be a single entity responsible for drawing these threads together and co-ordinating preparation and implementation of each MCZ management plan.  We believe that the most appropriate body is the Marine Management Organisation (MMO).  This role would sit comfortably and link logically with the MMO’s responsibilities for preparing and implementing marine plans and its broad range of marine powers and consenting functions. It would also help strengthen the integration of marine conservation management action with implementation of marine planning.  The co-ordination function could be undertaken without usurping or undermining the statutory responsibilities of the other bodies. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:140%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:11pt">Defra has stated that management of sites is currently being prioritised nationally according to the potential or actual adverse impacts of activities on the features designated in relation to fishing activities. This prioritisation will be further refined at a local level taking into account relevant information and will guide regulators to those sites which may need protection before others.  It would be helpful to have a timescale for these actions and to know whether it is the intention to apply a similar approach in respect of other potentially damaging activities.  If so, again those likely to be affected will need to be informed and consulted, in the interests of good regulation and to ensure that the MCZs are protected.  Our preference would be to see these exercises incorporated into individual management plans.  </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:140%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:11pt">The Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 requires the Secretary of State to report to Parliament every 6 years the progress on achieving the objectives of the network of MPAs in the UK marine area, including MCZs.  The first report was submitted in December last year.  We suggest that 2018 is too long to wait to learn whether MPAs including MCZs are being well managed.  There should be an interim reporting mechanism for management functions.   We suggest that for at least the first few years this should be done annually and that the MMO is well placed to undertake this </span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:11pt">task.

On other occasions, features were found that were not known about.  This problem </span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:11pt">is likely to cause major difficulties as marine planning and plan-led consenting and licensing process are introduced.  This was looked at by CEFAS in 2010.  They concluded in a report to Defra that “</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:11pt">the seabed habitat data currently available is too sparse, patchy and variable in quality to make sound decisions in relation to key planning and management processes”.  They also reported that the Marine and Coastguard Agency had estimated the cost of surveying all areas not previously surveyed would be £210m and that there was the capacity in the commercial survey market to do this.  It was thought that the resultant economic benefits would be several multiples of the cost.  As far as we are aware no action has been taken on this.  By contrast the Irish Government decided to embark on a seabed mapping exercise in 1999 and have continued the programme in the teeth of dire economic circumstances, because of the </span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:11pt">anticipated </span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:11pt">environmental and economic benefits</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:11pt">. </span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:11pt"> We believe that the UK Government should revisit the question of mapping the seabed around the English coast. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:140%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:11pt">Funding is always going to be a difficult issue; not just the funding of the research to provide the evidence for designation of MCZ, but also the funds needed to ensure that sites are adequately protected and managed.  Much of the latter burden will fall on IFCAs in relation to commercial fishing activity.  We would be concerned if their budgets proved to be inadequate.  Equally, if the MCZs and other MPAs are to achieve their purpose it will be important that the necessary funds are found to avoid them becoming little more than just lines on a map.  Preparing proposals for further MCZs should go hand in hand with identifying how the costs of subsequent management and scientific monitoring will be met.
