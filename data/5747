</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Stephen Phillips:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Secretary</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and how it applies.  I would like to explore with you some of the conclusions that might be drawn from some of the evidence that this inquiry has heard so far and ask for your comments on them and whether or not you agree with each of the conclusions that we might come to.  First, we have heard evidence that could lead to the conclusion that the Charter does not create new EU fundamental rights, but consolidates existing EU and non</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">EU obligations in a more prominent form.  To what extent do you agree with that?  Do you have any comment on it?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Chris Grayling</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Legally, that is the current position.  The role of the Charter in EU law is that it draws together rights that existed and were inserted into different parts of EU law over a period of decades.  It puts them into one single place.  It sets them out in a form that is designed to be a reference point for European law.  It has to be seen as operating closely in conjunction with the Lisbon Treaty.  The position around the Charter is that it is designed to apply purely to European law and European law matters; it is not designed to create new rights or to allow the creation of new rights in European law.  Strictly speaking, that legal position is absolutely right.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Of course, as I will say over the course of this evidence, one of the concerns will always be that you can read quite a lot of things into both the Charter and the Lisbon</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Treaty, and you can go to quite a lot of places, legally, within the framework that both of them create.  For example, if you look at the case that the Chair made reference to, the legal position as far I, my Department and the Government are concerned is first that the Charter does not create new rights in UK law.  It does not create new rights; it does not apply today in UK law; and the protocol, which was sold to us by the last Government as an opt</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">out, is not an opt</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">out at all.  The legal position is as you have described it.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt"> I want to press you on the second part of that question.  Do you think the rights that have been consolidated in the Charter have achieved greater prominence by virtue of the Charter’s existence?  Is that the Government’s understanding?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Chris Grayling</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: My view is that would be the case.  My view is that it has created a reference point for those whose vision is around the creation of a much more unified European state.  For example, Commissioner</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Reding, the Vice</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">President of the Commission, recently argued that the Charter should apply to national law as well as European law.  It is clearly seen by some as a reference point for the European</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Union and a vehicle for greater union in the future.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify;

font-size:12pt"> Some of the other evidence we have heard suggests that the increased prominence that you agree the Charter has in terms of the rights that it contains, might lead to those rights being invoked more frequently before national courts and the ECJ.  Is that also something which you agree with and/or fear?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Chris Grayling</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It has not happened to date, with the possible exception of the case involving Sweden that we will probably return to during the course of the discussion of the case involving Sweden.  As we sit here today, I have no evidence to suggest that the Charter is playing a more substantive role in legal decision</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">making in this country than would have been expected.  The judge in the case that prompted this Inquiry got it wrong—and I will talk a bit more about that—but that is because he misunderstood the protocol.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It is certainly the case that the Charter is a factor in decision</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">making in UK courts, but only when European law matters are being decided.  That said, it is my concern that in the Charter in the form that it is and in the way it sits alongside the Lisbon</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Treaty, I can see ways in which it could become a vehicle for European law mission creep in a way we would not wish to happen.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt"> In a sense, that is consistent with much of the evidence we have also heard.  From that, does it follow, in your view, that if there is an increase in Charter</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">based rights litigation, that would also lead to existing EU competencies being interpreted more widely than has hitherto been the position by both national courts and the European</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Court of Justice?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Chris Grayling</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That is a danger.  We have certainly seen it in areas in relation to the Lisbon</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Treaty.  It is not clear to me why that should be impossible in relation to the Charter as well.  In particular, the issue of free movement—and the way in which the ECJ tends to make free movement the paramount legal reference point—does create a genuine issue around where and how European law is to be applied.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Let me give you a practical example of how that has worked to date. In the field of social security, the Lisbon</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Treaty was very clear that social security is a national competence.  However, over the last few years, increasingly, the European</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Union and the European</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Commission have been playing a more and more active role in the field of social security.  The legal justification for doing so has been that freedom of movement trumps all, effectively.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We have found ourselves in what I would regard as the legally absurd position where we have ECJ rulings saying to us that we must provide welfare support to UK citizens who have moved elsewhere in the European</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Union, but we must also provide welfare support to citizens of other European</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Union member states who move to the UK.  Logically, both of those cannot be right, but that is the position that has come out of the ECJ.  The implication of that, quite clearly, is that, where freedom of movement is involved, the ECJ will tend to say that freedom of movement comes first.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We have an interesting case, literally from today.  The Commission—Commissioner</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Reding again—has put forward a formal request to five member states, including the United</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Kingdom, that we should look again at the rules that limit the right of access to vote in national elections after people have spent a certain amount of time outside of the country.  The rules are different across those five member states.  In some cases, you have to be resident just before the election; in the case of the UK, if you disappear for 15 years, after those 15 years you lose the right to carry on voting.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Now, it is a theoretical question at this moment in time, but if that issue were to be raised in the ECJ, which takes primacy?  There is nothing in the Charter that requires the UK </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Government to provide a right to vote in national elections at all.  The Charter simply refers to European elections and local elections.  National elections are quite clearly left as a competence of the member states.  However, if that particular situation were to be challenged in the context of today’s announcement under freedom of movement rules, I do not know what would happen.  Certainly, the Court has tended in the past to say that freedom of movement is more important than other things.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That is an area where you could see the freedom of movement rights enshrined in the Charter and in the Lisbon</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Treaty being used to argue for a broadening of EU competences.  I am not saying it would happen, but it is an area where past experience in the field of social security suggests that at the very least there is a risk.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">51(1) of the Charter, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">which states to member states that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">We think it is a legally accurate ruling.  Tim is the legal expert, but we did not believe this was a case that was legally unfounded.  However, it highlights the problem.  I am on the record as saying I do not believe this country should have signed up to either the Charter or to the Lisbon</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Treaty.  The problem with the two is that they contain something for everyone.  The Lisbon</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Treaty contains so much that, actually, if you are pushing an integrationist agenda, there are different ways of legally delivering your outcomes.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The reality is that we would believe that matters of tax enforcement should be a matter for national authorities.  Certainly, neither the Government nor, indeed, either of the parties within it have ever seriously argued that we should have tax enforcement moved to a European level.  Technically, however, because VAT is something that is covered by EU directives and EU rules, because it was the founding tax underpinning of the EU, this is somewhere where, legally, the truth is the EU does actually have competence.  When you have a treaty that is so wide</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">ranging, it gives the Commission—as we have discovered over social security—very broad</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">ranging powers to assert competence, even though it might not actually have been the intention of the member states that originally shaped the European</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Chancellor has said.  It is important, of course, not to take one case in isolation.  As Mr</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Franzén</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, where scope might, on one view, be taken to be a broader idea than implementation.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

there are varied wordings of individual rights that are in the Convention; there are footnotes to the Charter that make it clear that, even if things are worded differently, they should be treated in the same way, but there are places where the two diverge quite significantly.  My view is I do not really understand why, if the Convention wording was seen as a blueprint for this, it was necessary to rewrite them in a different form, with different wording, through the Charter.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Where we have reached in terms of the accession—we in the UK would be pretty vigilant about this—is it would not be acceptable to us for the accession of the EU to the ECHR to be, effectively, a Trojan horse for the European</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">November, on the Charter, which has caused us some confusion: “Of course [the Charter]</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> now does have legal force in European law</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.  </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The issue is about whether that legal force extends to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Southwark, stood up in the House in that very same debate we had and said there is no difference between us over our view of the role of the Charter and the issue of UK national law.  I cannot conceive of a situation where a hypothetical treaty change brought forward by somebody with the same view as Commissioner</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Treaty is very vague.  Even areas that we thought—and, indeed, were set out as such—were matters for national competence, like social security, are being eroded step by step by European</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">government.  We have to reach consensus in bringing forward legislation to the House.  Even were you to bring a private member’s bill to the floor and command the support of your colleagues, the resistance of the other two parties to change in this area would, I fear, guarantee defeat in the Commons—and if it was not in the Commons, it would certainly reach defeat in the Lords.  My view is we should prepare the ground for renegotiation and look at these issues in the round—rather than trying to pick an individual, albeit significant, step to take to address one of the issues we face.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Reding in what she said to the Council—was an attempt to ensure that all member states were covered by this directive, rather than some.  By adopting a different legal base from the one that we believed was right and most other </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">out from exercising it.  She made it very clear in a Council session that there was a geographical factor behind the decision that was taken.  What then followed was an interesting exchange between the Commission and the Council.  The Council legal services basically told the Council, “This is simply not acceptable.  It is on the wrong title base; it is not legal.”  The Council effectively enforced its will and insisted that the measure was returned to a Title</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

it is that we are in uncharted legal territory.  Therefore, we are doing the best we can to preserve the interests of the United</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;
