I wanted to take this opportunity following that to reiterate the CLA’s position. We are aware that you have received evidence concerned that the Stakeholder Working Group‘s proposals don’t go far enough. It is possible that the additional measures we have been calling for would meet some of the concerns which other groups, such as the Alternative Stakeholder Working Group, have expressed to the Committee.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.17pt; padding-left:3.83pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">CLA supports the Stakeholder Working Group (SWG) proposals on the understand</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">ing that they are all enacted</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">.  In particular, it is crucial that the cut-off (2026) is implemented</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> to provide </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">certainty.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">We</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> believe that a period of some 75 years is more than adequate to ensure that the definitive map is correct</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">.  It has been suggested that there are so many saving provisions and exemptions that the cut-off would be worthless.  We agree that that would defeat the point. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> It is therefore important that any saving provisions and exemptions are kept to a minimum.  Doing this will also reduce the burden on authorities past the cut-off point. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="2" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.17pt; padding-left:3.83pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">In order to be properly de-regulatory, changes must be made to all aspects of rights of way, not just alleged historic ways.

I have personally, in another role, overheard officials speaking disparagingly of those they are supposed to be assisting. Ensuring a fairer system starts at the top – if the legislation takes proper account of the impact on landowners and householders, then there is less scope for it to be subverted later. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="5" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.17pt; padding-left:3.83pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">We note the submission which suggests that there should be re-classification of </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">unsealed unclassified roads (</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">UUCRs</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">)</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> to restricted byways.  The proposal is aimed at dealing with the damage and distress caused by the unregulated </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">use of green lanes by vehicles, and of making such ways safer for walkers, cyclists and horses.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">  </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">A precedent exists in the re-classification of </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">roads used as public paths (</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">RUPPs</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">)</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> to restricted byways.
