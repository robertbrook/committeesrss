font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Welcome to you all, and thank you for being with us.  You have each given us some very useful written evidence and we are very grateful for that.  There seems to be quite a lot of agreement between you.  Could I just start by asking each of you to give your assessment of the performance of the PHSO as a complaints handler?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Dunleavy</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There are a large number of problems with the handling of what we might call citizen redress, which is the overall idea of getting things right in public services, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">making things that have gone wrong better and providing some compensation or amelioration if things have gone wrong.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The problem is that, over the years, the Parliamentary Ombudsman has become more and more marginal in the overall regime of citizen redress.  Particularly, there has been a huge growth of regulators in particular services, including health care.  More and more people are taking complaints to regulators rather than running them through the Ombudsman service.  Similarly, we have done research that repeatedly shows that most citizens do not understand the distinction between complaints and appeals.  They see these as very much part of the same process, and so because the Tribunals Service has been reorganised, has become more efficient, more comparable and operated better in the last few years, we have seen a big growth of some kinds of appeals.  People are using appeal routes rather than the complaints and Ombudsman route.  Finally, in some areas like taxation and perhaps social security, improvements in administrative procedures have slightly reduced the number of complaints.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Basically, the picture is from 2002 to the end of 2011 that the Parliamentary Ombudsman was becoming an increasingly irrelevant figure, even with the new health complaints role.  The new Ombudsman, Dame Julie, has made a big difference.  There are indications of a much more activist and outgoing approach to complaints.  That is the key thing.  I would like to see the Ombudsman as the centre of citizen redress, not really just a side figure.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Brian Thompson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The thing to bear in mind is that the Ombudsman is at the top of the ladder for the handling of complaints.  Therefore, the bulk of the complaints are expected to be dealt with by the organisation against whom the complaint is directed.  It is a different role; it is not dealing with all complaints, but those that are more difficult or have not been resolved lower down.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The jurisdiction is difficult; it is complicated and not helped by the legislation.  You will have seen—and of course you will get it in your post bag—that there are people who complain and are not satisfied with the service they have received.  It is very difficult to know whether or not they have a justified grievance with that.  The Office has a lot of discretion and the annual reports no longer detail the bases on which cases might be winnowed out.  This also used to happen with the Local Government</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Ombudsman that they could say </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">“outside jurisdiction”, “exercise of discretion on the basis that it was not something we thought we could actually help with” and those types of things.  It is difficult to find out whether those people who are dissatisfied have a genuine complaint or whether it is understandable that they have complained and they did not get the outcome that they wanted.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Hazell</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I have just two things.  First, following what Professor Dunleavy said, we should all note that, in part, the reduction in cases coming to the Ombudsman may be because of the success stories elsewhere that Patrick has described, in terms of complaints being better handled at the first instance.  Second, a lot of the work of the Parliamentary Ombudsman is constrained by the statutory framework that we will no doubt come on to.  In terms of the things that are within her control, it is notable how, under Dame Julie Mellor, there has been a big change in the complaints that they will accept and pursue through to adjudication.  There was a statement on her website this month saying that, in terms of health service cases, she expects to process and take through to adjudication three times the number of cases that were similarly processed last year.  There has been a big increase in throughput.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal;

font-size:12pt"> So we are all agreed that it is not because the Ombudsman has changed its practice; it is because there has been so much practice changed outside.  Then the Ombudsman is trapped in a statutory framework, which means the Ombudsman has been consigned to irrelevance.  That is probably putting it too strongly, but it is being marginalised by the statutory arrangements, the inability to take own initiative and things like that.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt"> What impact does the Ombudsman have on administrative practice?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Dunleavy</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We did a study back in 2003</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">4 for the National Audit Office and the problems then were that the Ombudsman was seen by most civil servants and other bodies as being very remote from contact with the large volume of case load and, therefore, dealing with very eccentric, unusual or special cases.  Even though the Ombudsman, over the years, has originated and promulgated some useful principles for complaints handling, and I stress the utility of complaints as a source of administrative improvement, I do not think there has been much of an audience for the Ombudsman until very recently.  I do not think that the Office has really used any kind of modern, digital or online means of disseminating improvement messages that would have wider resonance.  That is always going to be difficult because of the very upper tier case load that the Ombudsman has had.  I think other ombudsmen like the Local Government Ombudsman have been a lot more successful in influencing wider administrative practice.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Hazell</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is not directly in the Ombudsman’s control whether </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Whitehall</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> will raise its game in trying to learn systematic lessons from the complaints Departments receive.  The Ombudsman at best can be a coach and point the way, but it is up to Whitehall Departments then to decide whether or not they want to devote more energy and resource to that.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Brian Thompson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I would agree with that point that it does depend on the administration itself, as you have seen with the first part of the inquiry into whether complaints matter.  It has not always been the case that Departments are willing to take complaints seriously.  I would say that Ann Abraham did work on the complaints principles and did do some follow up work.  For example, on things like tax credits there was an initial investigation that put forward remedies and changes in practice.  She followed that up a couple of years later and found that there had been some improvements, but there was still some way to go,  That is a useful thing to do to go back and to keep the pressure up.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There has also been the recent innovation of doing a bit more on the annual survey of complaints across Government Departments, which was echoing what had been happening with health.  That seems to have pushed Government into their complaints forum, which is across Permanent Secretaries and various other people who will attend that.  I am trying to make the point that there is great variety amongst the complaints machinery of the different Departments and nobody who is in overall charge.  It is pushing and pushing, but if they want to resist, they will resist.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt"> We thought we had made a little progress with the Minister of State for Policy when he was in front of our Committee.  What effect do you think the demise of the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council is going to have on the flow of complaints to the Ombudsman, and what effect should it have on what the Ombudsman does?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Brian Thompson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Speaking as someone who was on that body, I probably have a slightly biased view.  To go back to the point that was made earlier by Professor Dunleavy, one of the difficulties is that we have this dichotomy between two ways of redressing things—complaints and appeals—and people do not understand that.  The way in which that is done, overseen and supported is fragmented.  You cannot really deal with tribunal appeals because that would be a matter for the Justice Select Committee.  They could not look at complaints because they would see that as being your territory.  The AJTC was the only body that had that overview and was therefore trying to look at things from the point of view of the citizen, the user, and how they could see things; they just saw it is all Government and we have a problem that we need to sort out.  It is something that the Committee did understand in the past in their report in 2007 about trying to have a collective portal, making an easier access into these things.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Dunleavy</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I absolutely agree.  The separation of appeals and complaints is just a completely bizarre piece of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Whitehall</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> thinking.  In some ways, a complaint is supposed to be some kind of attribution of blame, whereas an appeal is asking for a second look.  From an ordinary citizen’s point of view, the difference between those is abstruse and metaphysical; it is about as relevant as Augustinian philosophy to the normal person in the street.  Other ombudsmen, particularly the Financial Ombudsman Service, do not make this distinction.  They essentially just conduct investigations; they try to mediate between the body and the complainant, and then they investigate only if the mediation fails.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond;

</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> How acceptable is it that procedures should be established on the basis that large numbers of people will, of course, appeal?  How acceptable is that?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">a pyramiding of appeal rights.  It is quite tricky to get things right first time.  There are parts of the current welfare state where the appeals process is fundamental to any kind of correct decision making.  For example, in the DWP, a large number of decisions are appealed; a large number of those are allowed.    </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify;

it is much better now.  Use of social media is still just beginning.  I notice that the Office has one-tenth the level of Twitter followers that you have, Chairman, so there is still quite a long way to go.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt;

font-size:12pt"> I can tell you that the Ombudsman has one more follower as a result of you telling me that they were on Twitter.  They now have 502 followers.  This is a very important area.  Would you agree with me that part of the problem with the perception, as well as the reality, of the cases that the Ombudsman has historically deemed worthy of investigation has been the way that the system was set up and the way it has been communicated?  This is something that I have raised with the previous Ombudsman and the current Ombudsman.  What people often simply want, reflecting your comments, Mr Thompson, is for an acknowledgement that there was indeed a form of maladministration or some poor decision-making and an apology.  Yet, the way that the system has been set up, many of those cases, if it is not deemed that there can be a substantive award or something more fundamental, or a large scale investigation, are deemed not worthy of having an investigation, when there clearly was some poor decision-making.  I know that the current Ombudsman is trying to look at it, but do you agree with me that there needs to be an overhaul of the system, where instead of saying it is not going to be investigated there is a lower level or a first stage of looking at something and writing?  If that outcome is then getting acknowledgement that the decision was not made in quite the way it should, and that of course an apology, and no more, would be given to the individual who has suffered as a result, but that lessons would be learnt so that administration would be improved in the future, that would actually go a long way to avoiding this perception that the Ombudsman only investigates a small number of cases and therefore is frustrating and regarded by many people as not being an effective system.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">If we go back as far as two ombudsmen ago, when they were setting up the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman following devolution, Michael Buckley intervened to say that the nature of the legislation should be such that it gave the Ombudsman the flexibility of being able to finish early, because that might be appropriate in particular circumstances.  The best example of that is a provision in the legislation for the Public Services Ombudsman for </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Wales</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, which has been identified and recognised by the Law Commission in their report on the Public Services Ombudsman.  There is a concern that some people think, if they do not get an investigation, it has not been properly looked at.  It can be properly looked at without an investigation, but it may be that there needs to be a better alignment of the expectations of the complainant with what the Office wants to do and what it thinks is appropriate.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt;

font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Brian Thompson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: In the work that we did, the Ombudsman said that they had the two roles: first of all resolving the complaints that come in and then seeking to distil and disseminate the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">learning in order to help the public bodies improve their services.  They do see the two.  Naturally, the emphasis has to be dealing with the complaints that come through the door.  One of the techniques they have in other countries, which we do not have here, is the idea of an own</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">initiative</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, or as they call it in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">:  The time of the original legislation, I think.  I agree on individual cases and systemic lead.  The systemic effects of the Ombudsman have been weakening, weakening and weakening, largely because regulators have been growing in importance, because regulators do have inspection and active intervention capabilities whereas the Ombudsman does not have any form of that at all.  Even so, a lot of regulators are triggered by individual complaints now as well, if you look at the Surveillance Commissioner, the Information Commissioner and so on.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The Ombudsman is looking completely unusual in not having any kind of own</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Brian Thompson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: They have this odd position.  Initially, it was created because there were felt to be failures in legal redress and using political means of redress.  That is why you have the statutory bar that says, if there is an alternative means of redress, the Ombudsman should not accept the case unless, in the exercise of discretion, it would be unreasonable to expect the person to have recourse to that other remedy.  That is something that the Law Commission has recommended should be abolished.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">They have that difficulty, but they are absolutely now part of the justice system.  They have moved more and more away from the political thing, and there is more overlap with redress that might be got in the courts, but of course it can be got more cheaply than it would be in the courts.  They are mindful that there may be some cases that come to them where the better remedy would be one that would be achieved in the courts.  You sometimes get that with health, where if it is a clinical matter and somebody is wanting substantial damages, it would be clinical litigation rather than a complaint to the Ombudsman.  They have changed their role; they are definitely part of the justice landscape, but they are unusual in that they have a power of recommendation only.  By and large, though, through the moral suasion of having made a report and found injustice or hardship caused by maladministration or service failure, public bodies will usually act in accordance with the recommendations.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">As you know, that does not happen with the Parliamentary Ombudsman; the Parliamentary Ombudsman can lay a report under Section 10.3 of the Act and that is usually where this Committee comes into force, because it will then look into it.  That has happened more frequently in the past 10 years than it happened in the 40 years of the life of the Office.  Your Committee in the previous Parliament carried out a number of reports there.  There were physically four in the past 10 years and there had been two prior to that—six in the lifetime of the Office—which suggests that by and large the co-operation is there.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

it provides a Committee overview of the efficacy of the NAO’s work.  It looks at the budget; it looks at the value for money being delivered and so on.  I know that this Committee looks at the Parliamentary Ombudsman in something of that light, but it would be sensible for the Ombudsman to have a kind of commission to whom they were accountable for their day-to-day working.  It would be useful to see the National Audit Office fully empowered to cover the Ombudsman’s efficiency and so on.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt">Northern Ireland</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has said is that we are like the emergency services: we are complementary and do different things.  It is just to make the point that it is part of the provision of justice and it is providing it in a different and necessary way.  It is very different..   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt">an activist Financial Ombudsman Service, you do have a whole litany of repeated major problems, which are now being addressed by the Financial Conduct Authority.  You have this huge problem, as Dr Thompson said, between regulators and ombudsmen.  I think you need to just make sure that whatever new provision is set up for the Parliamentary Ombudsman takes account of the fact that this is going to be a recurrent source of problems.  It is very difficult at the moment with contracted-out services for people to get effective redress and they are becoming increasingly cynical about it.  If we move to a more integrated Ombudsman service, a natural part of that would be to ensure that the integrated Ombudsman had a degree of capability over delegated services.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

there is a simple complaints procedure.”  Even just writing a letter to the chief executive of the council or the chief executive of the local hospital might solve the problem quickly.  Going to the Ombudsman could be an unnecessary process.  That is one case; there are other things, like that the MP wants to be informed of things that are going wrong in his constituency, so he or she can take those things up as well.  It is also perhaps helping with the submission, because some people are not very literate, not very competent with bureaucracy and forms and so on.  The MP and their staff can be helpful in that respect.  I can see all sorts of advantages of the MP involvement.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">MPs are doing, but there might perhaps be 1 million or 1.2 million pieces of correspondence or email going through MPs from citizens per year, which is quite a lot.  Effective liaison between the Ombudsman and MPs would be a very important thing to safeguard, but with all due respect, I do not think that is what the MP filter is doing.  At the moment, what the MP filter is doing is putting off a lot of people, knocking out a lot of communication and inhibiting the ombudsmen in developing their relations with the public, in a very restrictive way.  I would really like to see something like a direct access from the public to ombudsmen, but with a tick-box where people could mark if they did not want the MP to be notified regularly.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There should be regular notification of the basic details of complaints and regular consultation between a single, integrated regional-level Ombudsman and the region’s MPs, because MPs have a fantastic amount of knowledge of what is going right and what is going wrong.  At the moment, that knowledge is very episodically reaching the Ombudsman and reaching other regulators.  I would like to see effective consultation and analysis, so that you would get useful data and information that would help you alert the Ombudsman and alert other responsible regulators and appeals bodies about what is going wrong in your area.  Sometimes, for example, a particular DWP or tax office may have far more of a problem than other areas, and at the moment, it takes a long time for all of that to filter through.  Everybody has a little bit of the picture, but are not really putting it together.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">If they do not manage to do that within six weeks, then the bank is automatically charged for a more formal investigation.  That creates a bit of an incentive for banks to actually do something within the six weeks, and then they do a relatively informal investigation, not using high-powered lawyers and so forth at that stage but just using ordinary, well-trained staff.  They come to a preliminary conclusion, which is then reviewed by high-up lawyers but is not itself the final stage.  Only if that is rejected by the complainant or the bank do they then go to the full legal thing.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">At the moment, what we have is a style of working in the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman where the complainant usually piles in a huge amount of evidence, much of which is irrelevant.  The complained-about body may also create a huge pile of evidence.  There is then a very long, thorough and possibly triple-checked investigation, and then a decision is announced, but you do not have that staging through; you do not have that process by which the complainant might become more realistic and more aware of the staging of the process.  Anything like that, particularly starting with a quick mediation effort, I think would cope with the austerity and staffing problems by imposing a bit of a charge on public bodies that are resisting and saving your high-powered legal firepower for a very late stage.  That is the process I would suggest.  I think that would then wean most people off being unhappy with the Ombudsman.  They would at least know that there had been a multi-stage process, and it would also be much quicker.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;
