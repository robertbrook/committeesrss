There will simply not be enough space for a pavement and a road AND a cycle lane in many cases. As such, without a revolutionary idea such as I propose, the problem of cycl</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">e safety in UK cities will never go away.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">2</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">. My proposal, therefore, is that while motorists drive on the left, cyclists should ride on the RIGHT. As long as cars and </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">lorries</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> have "blind spots", there will always be accidents - they will remain unpreventab</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">le. So the obvious answer is for cyclists to come TOWARDS the motorists. A report once stated that the best way for a pedestrian to avoid risk while crossing outside a designated crossing area is to make eye contact with the approaching motorist. Cyclists </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">at the moment cannot do this. For inexperienced road cyclists, this (not seeing what is coming behind you) causes fear and anxiety and while there is fear and anxiety there will be mistakes. By motorists too. There are enough things to be distracted by in </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">front of him (such as jay-walking pedestrians, cars pulling out in front </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">etc</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">) and as such he neglects to look as often as he should in his rear and wing mirrors. With cyclists coming TOWARDS him, he will again be able to concentrate mostly on what is going</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> on in front.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">3</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">. TURNING: turning right at junctions will prove a lot safer for cyclists with the new OPPOSITE DIRECTION idea. Turning LEFT may be more difficult but at least the cyclist turning will now be IN FRONT of the motorist, i.e. IN FULL VIEW just </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">like a pedestrian in a way. And it is the responsibility of the cyclist to make himself visible at all times. This will not change with the new system.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">4</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">. COST: the cost will be negligible. All that is required is for the cycle motif on lanes to be changed</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> and a big publicity campaign to be carried out. A trial period/place could be a good idea too.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">A catchy name might be "Right way" (as opposed to "wrong way", as it will continue to be, for motorists) or "Opposite view".</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><a name="_GoBack"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">December 2013</span></a></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
