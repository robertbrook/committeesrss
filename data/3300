However, there are some contradictory actions across Government; the new Community Rights and ‘Our Place’ (previously known as Community Budgets) provide opportunities for local communities.

The Our Place pilots have shown early evidence of gains. For example, two Locality members in East London are leading an initiative to recruit local people to become volunteer health trainers. Starting with a community door-knocking exercise, which contacted over 1,000 residents, Poplar Harca and the Bromley by Bow Centre have developed a programme which will save the NHS an estimated £4m over five years by promoting healthy lifestyles and improving treatment of those at risk of diabetes. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Where reform has not taken a community approach and instead has moved </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">to</span><span style="color:#1f497d; font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">prime/sub models or larger contracts in general, it has reduced the involvement of citizens and people who use services in their design and delivery.

We believe it is essential that wider policy objectives are achieved through public service commissioning and procurement in order to achieve best value.

I</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">n the previous commissioning round of the Work Programme, providers outlined minimum service standards in their bids that they were expected to adhere to. However, we have heard that the comprehensiveness and quality of these standards differed widely. The setting of such standards should not be at the discretion of private business and should always include quality provision for the hardest-to-help groups. Following this, service users and elected officials should have access to reporting data to confirm its accuracy. Private sector providers should not be able to hide behind a veil of ‘corporate confidentiality’.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 6pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">There should be more defined channels for people who use services and for providers down the supply chain to feed information directly to commissioners, and ‘gagging’ clauses that inhibit, or perceive to inhibit, feedback should not be in place.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 6pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The feedback and views of service users should be taken into account alongside formal targets, and can often bring to light unacceptable practice that is not obvious in results tables.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">2.

The only way to really ensure open access is by enshrining a core set of principles at the heart of future reform as outline in our introduction. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">5.

We believe a false rhetoric that grant funding cannot be accountable or achieve best value has spread, resulting in many contracting authorities moving from grant funding to the competitive tendering of services without taking into account the specifics of each situation. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">In many public service areas we are still seeing the increasing trend towards the aggregation of contracts, which is precluding more and more VCSEs from bidding. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Over the summer Locality ran a survey on the VCS’ experience of Public Sector Contracting.

An example is the recent proposal to introduce standard PQQs across public sector contracting. NAVCA has recently supported a member whose local authority outsourced financial assessment of PQQs. The credit agency conducting the appraisal uses a system that penalizes not for profits for the very fact that they are not for profit. A standard PQQ would not change this practice, proportionality and relevance is required.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">It is also important that any reforms are examined to assess if they will actually support micro businesses and local VCSE organisations, as we feel the category ‘SME’ is too large and the proposed changes would disproportionately benefit the largest organisations in this category. This is not simply a matter of ensuring that smaller organisations are able to compete – it’s a </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">matter of ensuring that the public purse cannot be held to ransom by a dominant group of providers who are too large to fail.
