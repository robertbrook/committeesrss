MCZs are also at risk from other factors such as invasive alien species, underwater noise and insensitive use by recreational users. Many of these factors are included in the 11 ‘Good Environmental Status’ (GES) indicators addressed by the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and a programme of measures is currently under development by Defra and others to ensure that the UK is able to demonstrate  GES by 2020.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="6" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">A policing system is needed - without enforcement, MCZs are likely to be ineffective. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">However  crewed enforcement vessels and monitoring are very expensive solutions compared with the relatively low economic value of illegal fishing activity.

For example, MAREMAP partners at NOC, BGS and Channel Coastal Observatory have significantly contributed to data interpretation and report delivery for several sites (&gt;10 by the end of 2014). In addition, recent MAREMAP technical workshops have ensured sharing of best practise in seafloor habitat mapping, including data processing and interpretation. Although a more strategic approach to evidence gathering (e.g. seabed mapping) would have been preferable and would have generated significant cost savings to government, the current MAREMAP partnership is now facilitating prompt and cost-effective delivery of reports for individual sites and should be continued. It is therefore vitally important that NERC and Defra continue to recognise the value of the MAREMAP partnership in the MCZ process.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="color:#1d1d1d; font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Question 4:  What the balance of factors should be — social and economic factors, as well as environmental factors — in considering further potential MCZs.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="9" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The policy decisions need to be underpinned by sound scientific evidence. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Question 5:  The level of ambition in the programme to establish protected areas (including MCZs), compared with the need for biodiversity protection.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="10" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Once tranche </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">2 </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">and </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">3 </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">are in place, t</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">he area of seafloor that is protected in UK waters </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">is expected to be at </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">recommended levels under the Convention on Biological Diversity, and the ambition of the Marine and Coastal Access Act (2009) and Marine (Scotland) Act 2010.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">     </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="11" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Natural systems with a high level of biodiversity are better able to withstand externally-forced changes such as warming and acidification of the ocean, arrival of invasive species, impacts of disease and pollution.  A diverse system is a robust system providing a wide range of valuable ecosystem services to the UK. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Thus the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">UK stands to benefit from improved resilience to climate change by investing in marine protected areas.  </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">27 January 2014</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:right"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">1</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div><hr style="width:33%; height:1px; text-align:left" /><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn1"></a><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic">Note that ‘ecologically coherent’ is itself not an easily definable term – it is unclear what exactly it means.</span></p></body></html>
