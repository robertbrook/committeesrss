font-size:11pt">urther consideration which is the distribution of benefits from the transport services beyond the public sector.  If, for example, a public house develops a successful restaurant business that is facilitated by the availability of late evening bus services</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> for its patrons and workers that requires support it would not be unreasonable for that business to contribute to the cost of the transport (after all most of us pay delivery charges for goods or </span><span style="font-family:Arial;
