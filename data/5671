The point was really made very strongly that it is the IT skills that they are crying out for, and people do not have them.

Digital literacy, transversal skills such as creativity, critical thinking, self-learning and communication, with a view to the job market, need to become part of education in all stages.

The latest figure we have at European level is a shortage of between 700,000, up to 900,000 by 2015, or maybe 2020. It is broader than that as well. It is the so-called STEM skills—science technology, engineering and mathematics, of which ICT is part. Employers are increasingly looking for people who are trained in those skills, whether that is at vocational education training level or at higher education level. Those are very much the sorts of areas that employers are looking for.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Mr Higgins, you are agreeing?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">James Higgins</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: I was specifically thinking of the Irish context with the skills in this area, because I think sometimes there is a disconnect between what is emphasised and what is integrated into the national curriculum.

Is this because the EU has limited competency in the area of education so they are not going to be specific and say that perhaps one of the big things in sorting all this out is to try to emphasise the importance of IT skills or to encourage member states to do something about it? I am just asking you as an aside.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Roland </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Freudenstein</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Education</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> is not only a national competency but in some cases even a regional one.

Nevertheless, the European Union can encourage; it can provide incentives, like in all these programmes such as the Youth Employment Initiative within the framework of the European Social Fund. But I think the key is really with the member states. A best-practice model where elements are taken from one country and maybe integrated into the context of another country is the key to success.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Plummer</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">: </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Exactly</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">.

I think it is a fascinating point the chairman has raised for us there about the interface between the two and when it comes in. My question is a broad one: what do you see are the roles of the Commission, the roles of national Governments, the roles of the Länder as well, if we take it to a reasonable level, of trade unions, of other partners, and employers, in the issue of solving the problem of unemployment?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">When we come here we hear a lot about the social dialogue. That works and it seems to produce evidence and, if we go back to the earlier exchange we had, seems to produce results, yet there are people who say you go so far and you should not go any further. We look at education there and vocational training. Who is responsible? Is it the employer who is responsible or should we now be looking to see that the authorities should be educating in the area of preparation for going into work at an earlier age, which raises issues of competency between the Commission and between the states? Who do you think is responsible and where would you say the social dialogue these days stands? Is it weathering or is it worsening, as we have been led to believe, or is it in fact still producing results in notable areas like </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Germany</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Roland Freudenstein</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: The stakeholders are a broad church, so to speak. To be contrary, it is no use for the state to ordain a dialogue of social partners on education or whatever else if the partners do not want to engage, so there has to be some degree of responsibility on the side of the entrepreneurs and the unions and the young people. States and Governments and regional Governments can be a catalyst. They can even be an initiator, but without the co-operation of the other parties concerned it is not going to work. There has to be a complex interplay.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert Plummer</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: At the European level in terms of social dialogue we concluded what was called a Framework of Actions on Youth Employment last June. That document set out a series of recommendations for actions at member-state level to help address youth unemployment, looking at issues around education, transition into work, and entrepreneurship. That is something that was negotiated with representatives from employers and trade unions at European level. There are now recommendations, and it is for social partners at the national level to look at how they would go about implementing some of those recommendations. We will be doing a series of annual evaluations for the next three years to see to what extent those recommendations have been taken forward in the different national contexts.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">In terms of who is responsible, I think it is perhaps increasingly a mix of actors. If you look at school-level vocational education and training, and university level, there is scope there for more involvement of a range of actors, including employers, unions, employers’ organisations, education providers and the Government, to try to develop the education systems at the different levels in the best way that they can to facilitate the transition from education at whichever level you might need it into employment.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">James Higgins</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: I think they all play a role and some actors have stepped up more to the role than others. As regards the European Commission, they have already done quite a lot on youth unemployment. I see their role as establishing the overall framework, perhaps the direction, and they have adopted that in terms of the Youth Guarantee; they have said that is the role they want to go down, and also to improve apprenticeships and traineeships. They have set the context and then the implementation ultimately falls on the member states. On that I was quite surprised that there was news that some of the member states submitted their Youth Guarantee implementation plans very late.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Some have not done it at all.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">James Higgins</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: There was a deadline. I would have thought that with the Youth Employment Initiative and with the money that has been made available there would be a scramble to get them in as soon as possible and to do a varying level of consultation, so we were very surprised by that.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">On the lower level of implementation I think probably the employment services, business, trainers and youth organisations all have a role to play. We talk about the public employment services adapting their needs for young people. It is a bit of a difficult place to go when you are young.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Even social actors such as youth organisations have a role to play as well. They can engage with young people and can get the hardcore ones who are more marginalised to participate. I was pleased to see that trade unions were mentioned as well, because I think that trade unions have a really important role. Young people are less likely to know about employment legislation, about workers’ rights, than other sections of the population. I think the trade unions as well, many of them have not been able to successfully adapt to young people because there has been a decline in many member states of trade union membership, especially among young people. From working with young people there seems to be a disconnect between trade unions and young people completely in many member states, so I think even the social actors need to step up in order to engage with this.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The report showed that in some countries a quarter of businesses could not get the people they needed to fulfil their positions. I do not know if that is some people holding their hands up and saying they cannot get them, or ones that are really, really trying to engage and to get young people, but there needs to be this partnership in order to get those young people trained and into the jobs that are waiting for them.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q214 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Could I ask you about training and apprenticeships, and about how much of an issue any of you think the question of the standard of training or of apprenticeships is? If it is, is this an area where the European Union should play a role or not? In other words, should it be the EU doing it, the Commission trying to increase standards, or is that something for nation states? I have another question, but I will come to it in a moment.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert Plummer</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: I will go first. When we talk about the quality or the content of apprenticeships and traineeships, I think the focus should lie on the learning outcomes. That is crucial because it is what you learn through a traineeship or an apprenticeship that will develop a person’s skills and competences and help them gain employment.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">In that sense the simple answer is that at European Union level it is not a question for the EU to be setting minimum standards or guidelines around traineeships or apprenticeships. This is something that is best left to member states, taking account, of course, of existing regulations, of the vast array of industrial relations systems that there are across the EU and or existing educational practices. For that reason it is best left to the member states.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">James Higgins</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: I think, again, the institutions have an important role in defining the framework. I agree that they cannot go in perhaps to the reserve competencies. We expressed a little bit of disappointment in the quality framework for traineeships that there was no specific reference to reasons in terms of apprenticeships, but we also recognise as well that it would be seen to be overstepping the boundaries to all of a sudden put in some sort of figure—and how would that correspond with minimum wage levels?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">I think the issue is that internships have cropped up recently in the past decade and a lot of the legislation of member states has not been able to adapt to that. How does an internship correspond with minimum wage legislation in the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">, where you are supposed to receive money for any hours you work, and if you get to five working hours then you have to be paid? Some member states have adapted to it, some have built in standards and others have not. I think the Commission is trying to react to this and ensure that we are not trying to solve youth unemployment here but also create another entry labour market for young people to go through before they can get into jobs. They have reacted to that to try to address it, but there is still a lot of work to be done.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q215 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> The other ball that was going to go with that is what do you think of zero-hours contracts, a contract whereby you have no fixed hours? You have a contract and the person who gives you the contract has certain responsibilities, but you have no defined hours, so you may have no work one day and a lot of work the next day.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Roland Freudenstein</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">I</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> have no personal experience—neither do I know anyone who has personal experience—but the way it sounds, it fits in perfectly with the demand for greater flexibility and for getting away from the classical, incredibly stiff, 20th century type of labour markets that we have in many member states. Again, if the European Union can act as a catalyst in bringing best practice to all the member states concerned, I think that would be a good thing. That is something where the European level should act, rather than in setting rules or minimum requirements.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> You think the zero-hours contract is a good thing, not a bad thing?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Roland Freudenstein</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: I believe, in the end, it is a good thing.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert Plummer</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: I am sorry to disappoint you, but I do not have anything to add.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">James Higgins</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: We would be very much against zero-hours contracts, firstly because they overwhelmingly affect young people. They are a reason phenomenally for people recently entering the labour market with no guaranteed pension or basic employment rights. It could also entrench intergenerational problems between older people in the labour market perhaps entering at a different time, when there was a more protected and regulated labour market, and young people coming in now.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Also, the question was raised earlier about incentives to work. I think if you bring in a system of zero-hours contracts and a very poor level of social community, you erode the incentive to work. I do understand the argument for flexibility in the labour market but I think that in many member states there already is a very high level of flexibility. In </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Spain</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> they already had a very flexible labour market. Currently over 90% of contracts created in the scheme are temporary contracts. I think there is an issue of flexibility in certain member states in certain contexts but the overall issue is not to do with flexibility. From our point of view it is to do with quality employment for young people.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q216 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Before you answer my question, you have a fascinating looking graph in front of you. Is it the result of your Up To Youth study?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Roland Freudenstein</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: No, these are taken from Eurostat. There are a couple of interesting figures. To give you a couple of examples, the NEET rate—young people not in employment and not in formal education or training—has not changed. In other words, if you look at the 50%-plus unemployment in some Mediterranean countries, there are people who remain in education in some form, although they seek employment. They do not belong to the group not in employment and not in training, they stick with education.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> That could be good.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Roland Freudenstein</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: It could be, but of course it relativises a little bit these horror stories of 50% or 60%. Among these 50% or 60% you have some who have nothing at all and you have others who at least compensate for not finding employment at the moment by doing something useful. It strikes you and it is shocking that we have such high youth unemployment but it needs to be specified, and that is what these figures are for.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> I was just wondering, coming back to the survey work you have done, whether there is anything in there that might be of particular use for us. We would be very grateful indeed to see it if we could, particularly with regard to people who raise the issue on the supply-side, and training.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The main thing from my next question relates to the three major planks that have emanated at EU level for a youth employment programme or the Youth Guarantee, the Youth Employment Initiative that is now working its way through the system, and the decision to encourage a diversion of some of the European Social Fund money specifically to reduce youth unemployment. What do you think about all these initiatives? Do you think they are welcome and we should have more or them, or do you think they are perhaps encroaching in areas where the Commission should not be getting too involved?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">In particular, if we have the time, we are anxious to follow the money, the experience any of you may have had with where the money has been going, who it is going to and whether there is any assessment being made of whether there is value for money being secured. That links in part as well to where we started when we were talking about the needs of different groups of the unemployed.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">James Higgins</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: We support the Youth Employment Initiative in a number of ways. First of all, to focus on regions with a very high level of youth unemployment, over 25%, I think that is the right place to start with the investment. We support the focus. The focus is on implementing the Youth Guarantee, so it is about training, it is about provision of jobs </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">when they are there and it is about getting public employment services ready or better equipped to deal with the needs of young people. We like the focus; we think it is very good. The only issue we have with it is that we do not think it is enough: €6 billion sounds like a lot of money, and it is, but the original estimation of the International Labour Organisation in 2012 on Youth Guarantee was €21 billion.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">We know that money could come from national level or it could come from the European Social Fund. The reason that we think there needs to be a higher level of investment is that Eurofound released a report on NEETs in 2011 that showed that €153 billion was the cost in terms of lost tax contributions from youth unemployment. So we think we need a good in</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">vestment in order to save money in the medium to long term.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">On the previous initiatives that went in, action teams were established to help member states spend the European Social Fund that had not yet been executed. I had a look into those reports and it seemed that most of the money went towards small and medium-sized businesses to help them employ young people. What I think is different about the Youth Employment Initiative, and what is perhaps more promising about it, is that it looks better to make some structural reforms if they want to do that, if they feel they need to do that on a local level, and to engage with young people, so the money is perhaps going in a different direction to try something a little bit new.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert Plummer</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: Around the Youth Guarantee we can clearly see that in some member states and in some regions in particular young people are in a very difficult situation and they need some support and the EU can certainly help to deliver that on a short-term basis. I think that with the nature of the Youth Guarantee, it should precisely be short term. In the mid to long term you need to look rather at labour market reforms, and reforms of education systems. We have mentioned apprenticeships, perhaps looking to develop or strengthen apprenticeship systems. That is one of the points that, as employers, we have been making for the European Social Fund: member states that want to should be able to have an allocation of ESF precisely for that reason, around developing and strengthening apprenticeships. In that way, by undertaking those reforms of the labour market and education, you get to the point where you would not need the Youth Guarantee.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">As I said earlier, you need growth to create employment. It is not for employers to guarantee work, so we should rather be looking at some of the structural issues that are there in the different member states and in that way overcoming the need for a Youth Guarantee.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">One other point I would add is that on a short-term basis the EU can help to seed fund—I think that is the phrase—certain initiatives from a European level, but it is important not to reach a point where EU support is subsidising schemes over a prolonged period of time. It should be targeted on seed funding and initial establishment and development rather than over a long-term period.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Roland Freudenstein</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: Just briefly, I think it is important to see that the Youth Guarantee is not a job guarantee. There is no way the European Union or anyone else can guarantee jobs. The Youth Guarantee is a programme that guarantees that we will make a concerted effort to improve the chances for young people to get employed, but I would re-emphasise what Robert Plummer just said; it is up to reform. Member states have to reform their labour markets; that is the key to everything. Then we need to tackle education systems and increase the mobility of young people, and improve language skills, for example. All these are different issues additional to the digital literacy that we talked about, but reform is the key. The Youth Guarantee is very much a temporary measure.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q217 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> One issue that strikes me that has been emerging and that we have seen back in the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> is the silo mentality that one finds in public services that are providing education and providing jobs. Bringing it together is extraordinarily difficult. Listening to you, I get the impression as well that one of the by-products of all this should be an examination of the public service offerings that then lead individuals into employment—the transition from education into work. Is there any specific work being done in that area into these kinds of topics?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Roland Freudenstein</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: Do you mean to tackle the silo mentality?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> That is a sense of what we are seeing here.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Roland Freudenstein</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: Let me give you some of the ideas that the Up To Youth participants put forward. They all tackled more or less this question of how to connect the educational world with the business world or with the work environment. Schools should set up entrepreneurial programmes for young people interested in starting their own company. They could have used the word “entrepreneurship”, it is just that they did not use that term. That is another key. This even goes to popular culture in some member states, rather different from </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Britain</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">, where entrepreneurship is not considered a particular virtue. Universities should establish stable partnerships with companies in practical work and traineeships, such as legal clinics and laboratories, led by experts and not only professors. All universities should have better officers who will help students find a job, depending on their studies. Also, their programmes should be dynamically attached to what the whole job market is asking for. It all goes in the same direction, precisely as you indicated, and this is what young people are telling us.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> We are up against the time.

As was mentioned earlier, they have a Public-Private People Partnership, they have created various networks and it seems to work quite well—so well that they are going to reinvest in it even more.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert Plummer</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: I will take it a bit broader and say co-operation between different countries, for example between employers’ organisations. If you are looking to develop apprenticeship systems, there is a lot to be learned from </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Germany</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> and from others.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Roland Freudenstein</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: I am taking the example not of Germany but of the Netherlands, with the single contact point that centralises all services aimed at helping young people get work, advice and assistance—a one-stop-shop system for young people so they do not have to run around from institution to institution.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Mr Plummer, what do you think is the impact of migration on the EU economic crisis? Is it a help or a hindrance, and what about the brain drain? I ask you this because it looks as though you are conducting </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">research on this</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> and you are probably </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">an</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> expert.

It can help address the mismatch of issues that we touched on earlier. Clearly there are issues of brain drain, particularly in the southern member states. It is something that is frequently raised by </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Spain</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">, </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Greece</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> and </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Portugal</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">. Mobility is not a silver bullet, it is true. It can play an important part in addressing mismatch</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">es and helping young people get work experience, traineeship options abroad and so on, but it has to be taken together with reforms of labour markets and education systems to help address youth employment.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Can I thank you very much indeed, all three of you, individually and collectively?
