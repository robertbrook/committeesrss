For ease of reference, this measure is number 88 on the list of measures </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:0.2pt">within the scope of the 2014 decision that we placed in the House library and further </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:-0.05pt">information on it can be found in Command Paper 8671.</span></p><p style="margin:18pt 18pt 0pt 0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:0.15pt">As I explained while giving evidence, one of the key issues the Government had in mind </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:-0.05pt">when considering which measures to rejoin</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:-0.05pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:-0.05pt">was that those measures will permanently come </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:0.05pt">under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) once we rejoin them. As you </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:0.15pt">know, many of the pre-Lisbon measures were political compromises in order to secure unanimity and as a result can be broadly drafted. If the UK Parliament enacted similarly </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:0.05pt">broad legislation UK courts would have to interpret that legislation were it ambiguous or </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10.5pt">unclear. Of course in the case of </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:bold">EU </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10.5pt">legislation, it would ultimately be the ECJ which would </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:0.4pt">decide how a measure should be interpreted. The key issue is what happens if the </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10.5pt">interpretation of that legislation by the ECJ results in unwelcome outcomes for the UK which </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:-0.05pt">the Government wants to address. If it was a UK law and a UK court then the UK Parliament </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:0.35pt">could respond. However, with an EU law and an ECJ judgment the - UK cannot act </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:-0.1pt">unilaterally to amend the law.</span></p><p style="margin:21.6pt 18pt 0pt 0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:0.15pt">With this in mind, the Government assessed each measure and considered whether on </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10.5pt">balance the UK should seek to rejoin it. In the case of the Probation FD, it has only been implemented by a limited number of Member States and we are not aware of it ever having </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:-0.05pt">been used to date. As such, at this stage it is very difficult to make an assessment as to how </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:-0.1pt">the measure might or might not work.</span></p><p style="margin:18pt 0pt 0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:0.1pt">When I made this point while giving evidence I touched upon the measure's vagueness in</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:0.1pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:0.2pt">relation to deportation and committed to provide you with further detail on that point in</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:0.2pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:0.05pt">particular.

My view is that the better reading of this FD is that this does not </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:-0.35pt">apply to deportees, as the provision implies that return should be a choice, but it is </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:-0.65pt">absolutely not clear whether other Member States, the Commission and ultimately the ECJ </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:-0.5pt">would agree.</span></p><p style="margin:16.2pt 0pt 0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:-0.55pt">Whether or not it applies to deportees and in what circumstances could of course have potentially substantial consequences in terms of the Probation FD's usefulness, and impact </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:-0.4pt">on the UK. If it doesn't apply to deportees then its usefulness (as a public protection </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:-0.45pt">measure allowing states to supervise incoming deportees who may present a risk) is </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:-0.8pt">obviously significantly curtailed. If it does apply to deportees then, although this may affect a </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:-0.5pt">relatively small group of offenders, we are unclear as to what happens in the event an </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:-0.6pt">individual is deported, the probation decision or alternative sanction is transferred, and </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:-0.6pt">there is a subsequent breach. In particular, Member States may make a declaration that they will </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:-0.7pt">not deal with breach locally, under certain circumstances, but will transfer jurisdiction back to the issuing Member State (and we already know from declarations made by some Member </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:-0.55pt">States that some States will do this). As a result, if the person has already been deported, </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:-0.7pt">and the receiving Member. State then wishes to return jurisdiction on breach, I am not clear what the status of that deportation would be. Alternatively, the transferred order may be </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:-0.35pt">unenforceable, thereby entirely undermining the purpose of the FD. These are very </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:-0.7pt">important questions and until we have clearer answers it is not a measure that I consider the </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10.5pt; letter-spacing:-0.6pt">UK should seek to rejoin.</span></p><p style="margin:23.4pt 0pt 28.8pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10.5pt; font-style:italic; letter-spacing:-0.65pt">October 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
