Qualifying as a Level 2 cricket coach with the help of Tony Blair Sports Foundation Funding and the past 6 months in my workplace has shown me just how far behind women are, even in a popular sport such as Cricket, especially with regards to participation, opportunity, leadership and enthusiasm. I was the only female on the Level 2 cricket coaching course in a group of over 20 men? </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">However, I am not a stranger to this phenomenon. When I completed my level 1 and level 2 FA Football Coaching qualification in 2009 I was also the only female on the course? Even this year at the Coerver Ltd Coaching Youth Diploma course I was 1 of 3 girls out of over 80 men in attendance?  I play a variety of sports regularly but female coaches in a variety of traditional male sports still seem difficult to encourage. Whilst on a British Gymnastic course I attended in the summer it was made up of entirely female trainee coaches?</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">The majority of coaching is a voluntary activity and therefore some of the reasons I have personally taken a break from coaching every now and then has been due to work commitments or because I struggled to find the time due to being in a relationship. Although, if I had been encouraged to help only every so often or whenever I could, rather than thrown in the deep end with full commitment to a team, I may have continued coaching all the way through?  As the old saying goes “Many hands, make light work”. My experience within the 2 x Under 9 year old football teams I help </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">coach,</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> we have 2 coaches and a team manager. The team manager </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">deals with fixtures, kit, referees and organising matches</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> and then at our weekly training and matches the coaches look after the boys. Please note the recognition that even at Under 9’s we only have 21 boys signed on to play?</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">So when I recognised this phenomenon above, we began to offer girl’s only coaching opportunities in football and cricket. Offering mother and daughter open nights, women’s only coaching sessions in schools, sports clubs or in local parks and even on the beach. Using social media, flyers, emails to encourage new participants and varieties of games to get women and girl’s to be active.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Yet, in a recent experience on the FA Futsal course for beginners, I was reminded of another hurdle of why sometimes I (and I’m sure other women) have been close to leaving sports clubs or stop playing altogether; and that, sadly, was due to other women’s attitudes. The nature of some girls and women to put other’s down in order to impress or emulate others (often men). In my experience some girl’s would bully, be unsupportive or be verbally or physically negative to many team mates that they saw to be less capable or simply did not fit in? This was often reflected in the way the same players being picked because they were ‘friends’, and the many assumptions made in sport that “some can and some can’t” (which I disagree with).</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">In addition an experience I wish to raise, that actually occurred this evening and aggravated me, is the age old experience I have had time and time again over my last 8 years of coaching. </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">The situation when a dominant male coach steps in and modifies my session without asking.</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> And his reasoning was “the players are stupider than I think and would not understand” therefore he saw need to change around my cones? As you can imagine this caused me much aggravation but how do I change this? Do I step in and mention it but risk looking territorial? Or do I wave it off and hope the players did not notice and will continue to respect me?</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Finally, this reminds of another issue of being a female coach…Respect. Men certainly have a presence when standing and coordinating a group and from my experience young boys and girls are often told what to do in school, at home by a female presence. The traditional female </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">role of asking children to complete tasks, pick</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> up, go here, and go there? So when it comes to sports coaching am I just another woman in their lives telling them what to do? This made me seriously consider what I want my players to get from their session and that is self-awareness. </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">The hope that they make the decision.</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> I can condition/ modify the games to help them consider various outcomes, but it is them as an individual/team </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">who</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> finally makes the decision and understands the consequences.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">It may look like I have spoken in majority about the challenges to female sport, however, there really are very successful organisations, female athletes that are invaluable role models, sports women and coaches that are more determined than ever to continue their hard work and help develop women and sport. Change isn’t easy, change isn’t quick, but change can often be a very good thing.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:10pt; margin:5pt 0pt 5pt 27.6pt; padding-left:8.4pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Availability of facilities for training and playing sport, for both girls and women, at both elite and grassroots levels;</span></li></ul><p style="margin:5pt 0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">In Northumberland we struggle to find enough facilities to train and find time allocations for competitions/matches (especially in the winter due to a lack of indoor or floodlit facilities).
