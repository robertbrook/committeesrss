font-size:11pt"> Good morning and welcome. Thank you very much for coming in. Could we start by looking at the changes in the conclusions of Working Group 1 for the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">fifth assessment report</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> compared with the previous assessment reports? If you would just like to highlight what the main changes are and why they have been made.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Sir Brian</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold"> Hoskins</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: Shall I start with a general comment perhaps? I think the first thing to say is that, after more years of research and observations, there is not a huge change in the conclusions of the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">AR5 </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">r</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">eport</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> and the science compared with the previous reports. There is a fair consistency through there. It builds on those and there are some little bits that perhaps are emphasised more and some slightly less.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">If I was to pick out one thing that impressed me as new—and I am sure others will pick out others—it is the fact for the first time we can measure the decrease in the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica and see their contribution to sea level, so the present </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">3 millimetres</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> per year of rising sea level. About a third of that is due to the decrease in the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Greenland</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> and Antarctic ice sheets. It had been expected that it would be there, but it can now be measured from satellites and I found that particularly impressive. As I say, other things have gone up and down, but I think the main thing is there is a continued and stronger message that we can see the changes in the climate </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">system that are</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> consistent with the increase in greenhouse gases that we can also see. Understandings have increased and models have become more complex, but still the same sorts of conclusions ride through as were there in the previous reports.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Stott</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: Yes, I think that is right. If you look across the report, you will see further evidence to support the conclusion that warming is unequivocal and then we have more evidence from right across the climate system of the effects of human influence on the observed changes. That is not just in temperatures of the atmosphere. It is also in temperatures of the ocean, reductions in snow and ice, rising sea level, and changes in some climate extremes. We have more evidence that strengthens that assessment on human influence on climate and then we also have new evidence around the future, the conclusion that continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and further changes in the climate system. Limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and we have new science that show this link between overall cumulative emissions and the overall warming of the climate system.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Allen</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: I agree with all that. I think one of the interesting developments that </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">has</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> emerged is how strong the consensus is both within and outside the IPCC on the science now. Reading through the submissions to this inquiry it is easy to get the impression that there </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">is still lots</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> of disagreement, but it is important to remember the things we do agree on. By and large the projections, where the IPCC’s critics have made projections, are now at the bottom end of the IPCC’s own ranges. There are other people who make projections that are at the top end of the IPCC’s ranges. That is why the IPCC gives uncertainty ranges. That is a very different situation to where we were back in the 1990s where we had people saying that they were an order of magnitude different from the IPCC’s predictions. We are now essentially talking about a range of uncertainty and obviously there should be some argument about where we are within that range of uncertainty. That is what the range of uncertainty is for. I will happily go into that in more detail as we proceed.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">I think it is a very interesting development that we are seeing such a high level of agreement on the big picture of the amount of warming we should expect over the coming century.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q2 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> Do you think, in the light of those answers, there are some areas of climate science that could now be considered to be settled?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Allen</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: Obviously no aspect of science is finally settled in the sense there is no more uncertainty about it. On the other hand, the disagreements about the size of the climate response are typically at the level of maybe 20%, 30% or so. You should bear in mind that a 30% </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">reduction in the transient climate response to warming we expect by a given date means that the warming we might expect between now and 2050 might take until the early 2060s instead. That sort of level of disagreement does not, I would imagine, make a huge amount of difference to the kind of decisions we have to make. While there remains uncertainty and scope for continued progress in the science, it is important to keep the uncertainties in context.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Sir Brian</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold"> Hoskins</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: Just to give an analogy, many people would have thought </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Newton</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">’s laws and so on were all settled, but along came Einstein. For most of us Newton’s laws are a good enough approximation; so “settled” means within a range we think we know where we are, but it is not. We know exactly where we are.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q3 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> Do you have any anxiety that controversies that arose from previous reports—take the hockey stick graph that seems to be referred to quite frequently—may cast doubt on the conclusions reached in AR5?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Sir Brian</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold"> Hoskins</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: There is a concern always if previous mistakes have been made, as in some cases, or maybe be accentuation of one view. It is a group of people and mistakes will be made and that should not reflect on anything in the future for that body. Of course, we should all be sceptical and we are all sceptical the whole time; so probing it must go on. It is not going to be taken as the Bible, but it should be taken as the view of a large group of scientists from the diverse range of where the scientists come from and this is the consensus view given by them. That is what it is. There must always be a concern if then people can return to a mistake made 20 years ago or an accentuation made 20 years ago to down excellent work that has been done now. There must be a concern.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Allen</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: The other important point to stress is it is very easy, looking at the very elaborate process involved in reviewing and setting these IPCC reports, to think that the strength of the evidence lies in the process of the report and, therefore, you can find any piece of grey literature used and, therefore, the process is undermined and the evidence is undermined. That is not how science works. The strength of the evidence, with respect, does not even rest with the number of FRS’s of the people presenting it—and I am only jealous—but it rests in the fact that the results are reproducible. In fact, if you want to explain what we have observed over the past century, it is very difficult to construct a climate model that does not warm—in fact nobody has yet constructed a climate model that explains what we have observed over the past century—and does not warm substantially over the coming century under a continued sustained increase in greenhouse gas scenario.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Just to illustrate this point, I hope you will forgive me, I did send in as some supplementary information the little two-time constant climate model that the IPCC uses. I would encourage Committee members—it is an Excel spreadsheet, it is easy to do—to put in some numbers, see how you can explain the data, and see whether or not your results differ from those of the IPCC’s. You will find it is very hard to plug numbers into that model and not get results out that are broadly consistent with the IPCC projections. Ultimately, it is the data that speaks for itself.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Stott</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: Just following up on that point, I think it is important to put the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Paleo</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> information in context. The IPCC assessment is based on multiple lines of evidence looking right across the climate system, from the instrumental data, warming of the ocean, changes in the water cycle, and sea level rise. All this wealth of evidence builds into this picture and robust comprehensive assessment, as I say, based on multiple lines of evidence of which the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Paleo</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> reconstructions with the uncertainties that are involved with inferring global temperatures from indirect proxies of </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">temperature play their part but a relatively small part in the overall assessment, which is based on our understanding, on our climate models and on the observational evidence.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q4 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> These are quite complex issues, certainly for people like us, and they are dealt with at some considerable length in the report. I think it would be unlikely that many Members of Parliament would get beyond reading the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Summary for Policymakers</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">. Are there any risks in that; that you are condensing a great deal of written material into something that is of a manageable length for people for whom this is not their exclusive preoccupation? Are there any concerns about relying on the summary for policymaking?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Stott</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: As somebody who was at the plenary meeting for when the Working Group 1 </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Summary for Policymakers</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> was approved, I think it is important to stress and for people to understand that those statements in the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Summary for Policymakers</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> are traceable back into the report. There are clear lines of sight that go from the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Summary for Policymaker</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> statements down into the wealth of evidence and the depth of evidence that is in there. Indeed, that is the crucial part of the process in which we are inducted as lead authors, to see that through. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Of course it is a condensation for the main policy-relevant conclusions of the assessment, but each of those statements is then traced through to the underlying evidence that then people can trace back into the peer-reviewed literature. As part of that process, that underpins the development of that summary document.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Allen</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: It is worth stressing the scientific community is its own best guarantor of the probity of that process. I was part of the internal discussion group that made the decision to lower the lower band on climate sensitivity, which made a lot of noise at the time. I have had a lot of feedback from colleagues in the scientific community about whether or not that conclusion was justified. Papers have come out since the IPCC report that point to substantially higher values for the climate sensitivity and people invariably send me emails saying, “See”, when these papers come out.

Remembering that I am just a normal layperson, it would excellent if you could speak in language I understand, and I am sure that would apply to a lot of my colleagues. Having said that, I always have this feeling that scientists are a bit like politicians; if you get two of them together, they will both argue with each other just to be different. I just wonder if sometimes the science itself and the arguments we have—and I am going to quote some people in a minute—are done just for the sake of argument rather than dealing with the facts as they should be. I could be wrong. You can comment on that in your answer.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Let me ask the first question then. The range of values quoted by the IPCC for the climate sensitivity parameter is quite large, between 1ºC and 6ºC. Given the importance of climate sensitivity for predicting the future changes, has the IPCC failed to adequately address this issue?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Allen</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: I am happy to start speaking to that because I was involved in all of this. The first thing to emphasis is you are absolutely right; a lot of the discussion about climate sensitivity is precisely because it is very hard to resolve. It is not nearly as important a property of the climate system as the transient climate response that I mentioned earlier. The transient climate response is basically the warming you get when you reach double CO</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:7.33pt; vertical-align:sub">2</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">. Forgive the jargon here. The climate sensitivity is the warming you get when you get to double CO</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:7.33pt; vertical-align:sub">2</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> and then you hold concentrations there forever—and the definition does mean forever—and see what warming you eventually end up at. Therefore, as you might imagine an infinite prediction, which is the climate sensitivity prediction, is much more intrinsically uncertain than the prediction of the transient response. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">A lot of the controversy, and certainly all the statistical controversy about statistical methods, revolve around this parameter that doesn’t matter very much because there are other things that we know better than that.

One example of that would be the El Nino - Southern Oscillation, but there are others like the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which is what we call a multi-decadal scale type of variability. That means that the temperatures can warm and cool globally on several decade timescales, potentially, and that is not due to the additional greenhouse gases that we put into the atmosphere. That is a natural process. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">We have understood this factor for a long time and we have taken this fully into account in the assessment.

One term that has been used is this stadium wave type of effect, but it basically relates to natural internal variability. We have found that the greenhouse effect dominates in terms of the last 60 years. What you have to remember is the timescales are important here and also what we call the fingerprint. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">For the timescales, these modes of decadal variability, very importantly, vary the temperatures from decade to decade—that is a very important part of our climate system that we are seeking to better predict—but they do not provide the very long-term warming that we are seeing as a result of greenhouse gases.

I was not part of this last IPCC report—I have only been part of one IPCC report—and, if I had a criticism of IPCC, I would say in the past there tended to be rather too much thinking that everything was being explained on the multi-decadal timescale from the greenhouse gases or the aerosols or the volcanoes. I think there was perhaps an underestimate of the natural variability. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">This recent period has been an example of this last decade or so where natural variability has been very apparent. Probably in the 1990s the natural variability was encouraging the warming. It is disentangling these two, but with the very strong theoretical basis and the observed warming over a 100-year period giving some agreement we are seeing what we think is the fingerprint of our anthropogenic warming on that century timescale. When you get down to the decadal timescale, then we see a lot of the natural variability tending to dominate.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Allen</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: I just want to chip in. That disagreement on the role of natural variability over the past century is precisely reflected in the range of uncertainty in predictions for the future. If you have a look at your Excel spreadsheet climate model you will find that, if you go to the lower end of the response, you get a rather smooth curve over the past century because there are very little aerosols in that scenario and you get the lower end projections. If you go to the highly responsive model with higher aerosols, you get something that goes up and down more, as the observations did, and gives you a higher warming in the future. However, when you look at both of them, both of them are broadly consistent with the observations. There is just not enough in the observations to say, “This one is right and that one is wrong”. We can’t look at the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">observations and say, “Because the observations have gone up and down in this way, it must be natural variability”, when there is an alternative explanation, which is that it is driven by the combination of greenhouse gases and aerosols. We account for all of those possibilities in coming up with the ranges of uncertainty.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Sir Brian</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold"> Hoskins</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: I am afraid it may be more complicated than that because one of the really interesting and important climate changes could be a change in the natural variability.

There are also initialised experiments that go into the IPCC report where the models have been reconciled with recent observations. These are new in the current report and one of the lines of evidence supporting that lower range was obviously that the models that had been reconciled with recent observations were giving lower projections than the models that were just running free.

You say the assessments are based on expert judgment, but they are based on a range of lines of evidence and it is the expert judgment that is used to draw those different lines of evidence together.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Stott</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: That is right. It is also worth pointing out that the so-called transient climate response, the range of the CMIP5 model range, is consistent with estimates where you also bring in the observations, your understanding and your models together. In fact this is what we are doing here. We are bringing models, observations and understanding together to give an overall assessment, but there is a consistency of all of that evidence that underpins that overall assessment on transient climate response, which, as I say, is overlapped strongly with the basic CMIP5 model range.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q13 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley:</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> It does not, of course, because point 3 is outside the range given by the CMIP5 models, the bottom range of which is 0.48º. I think we can go on too long about this. The point I am trying to make is the point you make and particularly the points in the technical report are all good science, but what you entrust us, the policymakers, to know in the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Summary for Policymakers</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> is politicised. You think, “We won’t tell them that we have scaled down below the range given by the models”. Today the Chancellor is going to give the latest figures for GDP; if it were to emerge that the figures he was giving were not those given by the Treasury model but his expert judgment and he had not told us that, there would be trouble in Parliament.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Allen</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: I don’t know the process whereby the Chancellor comes up with his numbers, but I am sure there is an enormous amount of expert judgment in running that Treasury model. The key point is there is an enormous amount of judgment in running climate models. There is nothing sacrosanct about ranges that come out of the CMIP5 ensemble. We rely on a whole range of lines of evidences, including observations and these models, to provide these projections and those are the projections that are elevated to the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Summary for Policymakers</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Just to pick up on the notion, “You no longer rely on the models”, there are certain things for which I would never rely on these models and there are other things that I would. That is where the expert judgment comes in. You have to look at a model and ask yourself, “Is it appropriate to the question that I am asking with it?” If you wanted me to use one of these models to predict whether there is a white Christmas in 2030, it wouldn’t work, but that doesn’t mean that the model is useless for giving us the big picture estimates of what warming we should expect over the coming century. There is no mechanical process for taking a set of model results and turning a handle and getting a set of answers out, and I suspect there is not a mechanical process like that in the economy either.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q14 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley:</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> You are certainly right there.

What happens is, in the longer term, the lines of evidence coincide sufficiently well that we are able to say there is no evidence for the models being either an overestimate or underestimate and the 5% to 95% model range—so most of the models—are assigned only as a likely outcome. You say the models are assumed to be right, but that is incorrect. Explicitly in the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Summary for Policymakers</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> we say there is a one </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">in three chance of the real world lying outside that model range; whereas, if we just took the model range at face value, we would say that was only a one in 10 chance. In the longer term as well we are not just relying on the model ensemble. We are using it as one of the lines of evidence that is fed into the assessment.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Stott</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: That is right, and that is also the point I was trying to make earlier. The overall assessment of the transient climate response between 1ºC to 2.5ºC, bringing in our information from the recent observations as well, is very consistent with the overall 5% to 95% range of the CMIP5 models, which is from 1.2ºC to 2.4ºC. You can see how there is consistency of evidence there.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q15 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley:</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> A recent paper by Swanson et al published last year, </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Emerging selection bias in large-scale climate change simulations</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">, says the remarkable thing is between the previous generation of models and the one currently used there has been a greater convergence between the models. The models now agree with each other much more but they agree with reality less. The previous range did include reality in the range of projections. He suggests that is partly because there is a natural tendency for model builders to try and agree with each other, and partly that they are all trying to simulate what is happening in the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Arctic</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">.

There is in fact a larger spread in those model runs and that is part of the assessment.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Now, if you assess those models against the longer-term climate changes, we have always expected that there would be variability. It comes back to the point about variability. That has been talked about in IPCC reports going right back to the first report about the important role of variability from year to year and decade to decade. We have always expected to have periods of faster warming, which we saw leading up to 1998, and periods of slightly slower warming in terms of the surface temperature response. What we have to remember there is that is an imperfect measure. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">That surface temperature index is an imperfect measure of what we are talking about here, which is the energy imbalance as a result of the enhanced greenhouse effect. What we have seen there is we have seen about 93% of the additional heat is going into warming up the ocean and we are seeing, if you look at measures of the overall energy of the climate system, that has continued to increase over the last 15 years. If you do the assessment of the models against a whole raft of climate indicators over those longer-term time scales that you need to do to assess their fitness for purpose for the longer-term changes—and we did this in this study that Myles referred to earlier and a number of studies have done this—we see that the models do a good job of representing the larger time scale changes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">We see the potential that the fastest warming models may be slightly less consistent and we have this potential to scale by about 10% as we have already discussed, but on the broad scales the models are validating well against the observations.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Allen</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: This point about the models agreeing with reality less, in order to make a statement like that you have to choose some aspect of reality that you decide to compare your </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">model against. Okay, the surface temperature is problematic because it is contaminated with internal variability and it may just be what we have seen over the past decade is a random fluctuation that would take many more models than what we have in the consumer ensemble to reproduce. However, there is that study that Professor Hoskins mentioned earlier where they are specifically looking at observations of reality that are particularly relevant to the feedbacks that determine climate sensitivity. This study published recently showed the models that agreed with reality best were the ones with the very high responses and, of course, that is the observation of the world that is particularly relevant to that process. If you are testing models, there is obviously an element of judgment in deciding what is most relevant to understanding the model performance.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q16 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley:</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> Those combined were quite long answers and I will read them with interest to see whether they provide me with the answer to my question.

With the simple models we can run quickly on a PC, such as the one I provided you all with, yes. With the very complicated models that take several years to run, the answer is rather obviously no, because these estimates were only available last year. Obviously it is not possible, but you can imagine CMIP6 will use these new estimates and that just reflects the different time scales of different types of model and assessment. However, it is worth stressing, when you put these new estimates into the simple models, you get the range of uncertainty that is consistent with the ranges that are in the IPPC fifth assessment. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q21 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley:</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> Surely you get a different range of uncertainty.

That change doesn’t make much difference to the projections. If we stabilise, then that revision changes the range of outcomes. If these ranges are correctly specified at any given time, you should not expect that they will always get smaller. This is not a ratchet. If we give an honest assessment of uncertainty, you should expect that to wobble as we proceed into the future. I think this Committee should appreciate that is what happens because, at any given time, these assessments represent the state of the evidence at that time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Sir Brian</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold"> Hoskins</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: Can I just add to that? I think one of the amazing things about the IPCC is how the equilibrium climate sensitivity range has stayed the same over the years. That would seem we have not been doing any science to try and refine this, but during that period those started with an atmosphere-only model with a fixed ocean underneath. Then gradually the system has become the whole depth of the ocean involved, the vegetation on the land and the ice. The system has become so much more complex and interactive that is modelled and uncertainty ranges could well increase as you do that. The triumph has been that most of them have stayed about the same.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Allen</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: It may come up later, but in one of the submissions to you the IPCC was criticised for not using a very specific branch of statistics, the so-called Objective Bayesian methods, in quantifying our uncertainties. The job of the IPCC is to be inclusive. We have to assess the full range of literature and the different methods that different people use and obviously every author likes their own method. I was a bit of a fan of the Objective Bayesian methods a few years ago, but there were problems. It turns out they had paradoxical consequences as well. What the IPCC ends up doing is assessing the range of methods used in the literature and presenting results accordingly.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q25 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Sir Robert Smith:</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> Is it possible in the time we have to summarise why there was an increased confidence in human influence?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Stott</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: Yes.

As I said, our null hypothesis starting point is that we can explain it just by internal natural processes and we can rule that out at very high confidence levels, but then it becomes the so-called attribution question of how we quantify the human role. As we have already discussed, as a starting point it could be that it is dominated by natural factors and that human factors is rather small. This is where we have increased our confidence in saying that it is extremely likely that more than half of the observed warming, therefore the dominant cause, is human influence. To do that you need to bring all the evidence to bear including, importantly, the ocean temperatures. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Previously in the AR5 there was a lot of variability apparently in the observational records, which we have now understood was an artefact of a different bias in those measurements. That is one example of where we have improved our confidence, but it is not just in terms of ocean temperatures. It is also in terms of other factors such as the retreating ice and snow. We have developed our understanding of the water cycle. We have developed our understanding of extremes. When you look into our chapter 10, you will see we have a table at the back there with 33 rows where we have itemised all the evidence, both the evidence where we have multiple lines of evidence and also where we have remaining uncertainties. We have a greater wealth of evidence now than we had, with better understanding, with more observations and also with the improved models as well.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Allen</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: Just briefly, to come back to the earlier conversation, I recall one of the big arguments in AR4 was over whether human influence via aerosols could be masking the human influence due to greenhouse gases. That was one of the big uncertainties. That uncertainty has now come down because we are more confident that the aerosol forcing is not at the really high end that was considered possible back in AR4.

This uncertainty in aerosols is reflected in our uncertainty and specifically the warming attributed to greenhouses gases, which of course is highly relevant to quantifying uncertainty in the future. As I emphasised before, it is that uncertainty that contributes very substantially to the range of uncertainty in future projections—this balance between aerosol induced cooling and greenhouse induced warming—but this was specifically focusing on how much of the warming over the past 50 years is attributable to overall human influence. That is a situation where our reduced estimates of aerosol helped increase your confidence in the total human influence.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q32 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> Given this increased confidence and what all of you were saying at the start, that there was a slightly increased consensus about broad conclusions, one of the terms of reference of this inquiry is, do the conclusions of the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">fifth assessment report</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> strengthen or weaken the economic case for action to prevent dangerous climate change?

One consequence of this is that, as long as our emissions continue to increase exponentially, the long-term committed warming increases at the same rate. Since emissions have been going up at rough 2% per year over the past five years, the committed warming we get by simply continuing to dither has gone up by a similar amount. That is just as a consequence of the accumulation of carbon in the system. That is a good indication. The actions we would have needed to have taken to meet a 2º target in 2010, if we postpone those actions to 2015, they would only meet a 2.2º target.

As I said before, I can be critical of certain parts of the IPCC reports but the consensus view that comes through, which is very difficult in a complex area like this where you have different scientists doing different things—the system itself is very complex. To get a consensus is not a natural thing for scientists and it is sort of demanded by Governments and by the UNFCCC process to get a view that they can take on board, trying to synthesise the science that is around, so that they can have it and then say, “Well, what must we do on the basis of that”? It is not a natural process for scientists to go through this but, given that, I think it is a remarkable job that has been done.

I think what we have seen from the models over the years and from the IPCC is a projection of a climate where the circulation of weather stays the same but the whole system is warmer so you a bit more rain out of it and so on, but there is no confidence yet on how things like the El Nino, the circulation or the storm track that affects us might change. This is the challenge now, as Peter is saying, is to get more confidence in what the interaction is between the natural variability, the natural process with phenomena like storm tracks and this changing climate. That is a real challenge, but it is one that has to be there for adapting to a change in climate and you could say it would be very influential if, for instance, one had confidence how something like the Indian monsoon was likely to change, because the confidence at the moment is rather small on such things.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q35 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Ian </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Lavery</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> In terms of the organisation of the IPCC, there has been a lot of criticism.

Since the ER4, the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">InterAcademy</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> Council criticised the IPCC and they recommended a number of improvements to the practices and the structure.

I think there were 26 recommendations and 20 of them have definitely been given a tick. Most of those were to do with how the IPCC assessment was done in terms of the scientists and the review process. In fact, putting those into place has made it even more burdensome than it was before. It is a case where the review is so intense and the process has just become more burdensome. For the scientists involved I can say that it is now a huge commitment to get involved. The recommendations have been followed in terms of the assessment and, in terms of the response to </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">criticisms,</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> I think they have been involved. There were some in terms of the sort of IPCC head office that I do not think have been followed yet, but perhaps it was not opportune to do so at that stage. It was almost committed at that stage. Not everything has been followed, but I would expect by the next one, if there is, they would be. However, the question over whether the process has become so burdensome certainly has to be raised as well.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">D</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">r Stott</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: It is hard work, for sure, and we can both vouch for that.

There is clearly, rightly, a very strong scrutiny of the statements that go into that and a very clear process in terms of making sure the language is as clear for the policymakers as it can be. It is policy relevant, but not policy prescriptive, but it is not a political process. It is a scientific process where we, as scientists, had the final word in agreeing to that final document. I think sometimes there is a bit of a misunderstanding about that process, but it is very clearly based all around the science and around the extent to which our assessment does reflect our scientific understanding, as provided in the underlying reports.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Allen</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: I should probably respond to this, because I may have been one of the people you have been able to read in the press criticising the IPCC process. In the big picture, the key thing is to recognise the strength of the evidence of human influence on climate does not rest on the IPCC process and, whether you have however many thousand authors involved, it rests on the evidence. In some ways, the IPCC process has become so elaborate that it almost distracts attention from the evidence itself and I think that is potentially a bit of a problem. I very much hope it will be significantly streamlined in the future.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q36 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Ian </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Lavery</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> What areas of the IAC report have not been effectively addressed?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Brian Hoskins</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: As I suggested in my previous answer, I think there were elements to do with the IPCC head office, the head of the IPCC and the organisation just under that, which does not affect those involved in doing the report that much, but it is the infrastructure on top.

I strongly support the Netherlands proposal that I believe has been put forward to the IPCC Bureau for an annual assessment, which is not one of these multi-thousand page documents, but something much more streamlined—simply giving the conference of the parties an update on the science every year—and then we have special assessments when the science changes and when there is some call for it, special reports. That structure would work far better and would much better reflect the progress of science, which does not work on a six-year cycle. One of the worrying aspects of the IPCC is how climate modelling activities have to be kind of shoehorned into the requirements to do the runs for the next IPCC assessment and I think that is unhealthy. I think an annual assessment supported by extensive special reports would be a much better process. This is the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Netherlands</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> proposal.

I think the science is full of probing and discussion and sometimes that gets into the media, and that is fine and each person will try to say that their view should be carried forward to politicians. One of the interesting stages we have reached now in my discussion with some of those sceptics—I am a sceptic, but with some of those who in the common parlance would be called sceptics—is that there is general agreement on the science now. It is a question of what actions should be taken on account of that. I hope we have reached the place where we can say, “There is a range and some people might put their number on the bottom of that range. Okay, it is possible they are right, but we do have a range”, and that we can agree on that and then say, “What is the likely outcome of these projections and what policies then should follow from that?” As was said earlier, the IPCC gives a range. If we can accept that and move forward, rather than probing particular things and waving one’s own banner on that, let us say, “It is just about agreed. We do not know all the details and let us move on to the next stage of saying, ‘What should we do about it?’”</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Allen</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: There is a little note I wrote with Thomas Stocker recently that made the point that if we are the low end of the IPCC’s range, we have to reduce emissions by 1.4% per year from now on and if we are at the high end, we have to reduce emissions by 2 point something per cent. In terms of policies, in both cases we have to reduce emissions by a challenging amount from now on, so the remaining uncertainty does not necessarily have that much impact on many policy decisions we have to make. It is not to say we should not make efforts to resolve it, but I think we should be thinking about designing policies to accommodate the remaining uncertainties, rather than necessarily waiting until these uncertainties go away.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q39 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Ian </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Lavery</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> Finally, does the IPCC lack credibility and, if it does, how can it be improved?

The IPCC does not exist except for the scientists who are involved in the report, as far as the scientists are concerned. It depends how you number it, but some 800 scientists were involved in writing that report, and, having not been involved in this time, it is incredibly interesting to see what was going to come out and incredibly interesting to read it. In general, I think it is viewed as a very positive thing, except for the burdensome nature of it and whether it is the right thing to do or </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">whatever, but the assessment of one’s science provides a sort of six-yearly thing at the moment. It is just amazing for the young scientists to say, “This is the state of the art. What can I do?” It is providing a superb assessment of where we are and that is generally the thing in the scientific world. Of course, in the wider world, maybe there will be people with certain lines who wish to try to not give it this credibility.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Stott</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: I should say that I am very proud to have been involved in the IPCC as lead author in the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Fourth Assessment Report</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> and the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Fifth Assessment Report</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> under the leadership of the co-chairs of the Working Group I—Susan Solomon, Qin </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Dahe</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> and Thomas Stocker—who impressed on us the importance of robustness, comprehensive assessment, traceable evidence, and I think it is a remarkable achievement.

Let me give one thing about the present process, this six-yearly thing. It has been said that the modelling centres then all have to run on this six-year cycle and that is not the natural thing for them. I totally agree with that, but there is an advantage that one has a body of results from all those models that one can look at, at the same time, and analyse in great detail. This bank of data exists now and many thousands of scientists around the world are interrogating that data and they are all there at once and one would lose that. There are advantages. I think maybe we have to try to get some mix where there is a faster, slimmer process that maybe takes particular aspects, but then there is also time for a total look at what the projections are giving from all the modelling centres.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q41 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Albert Owen:</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> Dr Stott, just before you come in, how do you think that would impact on policymakers though?

From discussions among </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">colleagues, I am detecting a consensus—and we have touched on this already—around how we can avoid this process becoming even more burdensome on the scientific community.

There is one thing to have an error creep in. There is another thing to not react properly when it is pointed out, and there is no doubt the IPCC at that time did not react properly.

In that process, not everything is in the peer-reviewed literature, and that does give a problem. In Working Group I there is an absolute thing of keeping to peer-reviewed literature and that is the science that we are focusing on here.

We have signed a conflict of interest statement or we signed it as part of this process.

I think that is an enormous benefit of the IPCC process. Then we obviously go through all those review comments and make sure that they have been adequately addressed. That is a way in which we can elicit input. Although I may have made some remarks earlier that sounded like I was very critical of the bureaucratic nature of the IPCC process, it does have its benefits because it means that we draw in comments and thoughts from directions where we might not have done so otherwise.

I am a chemist, not a mathematician and so I am treading somewhere where I fear to tread, but my understanding of Bayesian analysis is that when you have high confidence of something and you miss your target, you should have less confidence, not more confidence. Why do you have more confidence?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Brian Hoskins</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: I was not part of it, so I will not say “we”, but let me say that the models were not in the position to predict the hiatus, because that would have been an initial value problem where they would have needed the observations over the whole depth of the ocean as well as more of the whole climate system to start the model off, like a weather forecast if you like. That information was not available and so they were just running and would not expect to predict that behaviour. There is no way that counters the model. It is the sort of variability one would hope that the long runs of the models would show and I suspect that the models do not quite have enough of that sort of variability in general, which means that climate can change faster in one spell and less fast in another spell. They are probably slightly too uniform in their behaviours. There was no attempt and, in fact, there would have been no ability to predict the hiatus at that time. That was a decadal prediction problem for which the initial data were not available, but perhaps I can hand over to you.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Stott</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: Maybe it is just worth pointing out that back in the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Second Assessment Report</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> there was a statement when it was talking about warming rates to 2100. The actual annual to decadal changes would include considerable natural variability, and this is part of what we are seeing at the moment and part of what has been assessed. Of course, it has been relatively challenging to assess this, because we are talking about very up-to-date information and therefore, for the cut-off date that the IPCC had, which was 15 March last year, there has not been a huge amount of literature, but that literature was assessed. In fact, the assessment that was made in the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Fifth Assessment Report</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> has been borne out by further evidence we have had since. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">In the assessment it talks about particularly the contribution from internal variability, including a possible redistribution of heat within the ocean, and we have seen some literature since then—we also discussed this in the series of notes that the Met Office produced as well—that has talked about the potential role of the Pacific decadal oscillation, all within a context where we have seen multiple indicators of climate change, including estimates of the increasing energy of the climate system, continuing to increase in the last 15 years. There is more work to do to further delve into exactly the details of that Pacific decadal oscillation and what that is doing, but there is clearly an implication behind that, which is that there is an expectation for warming rates to pick up in the future as the mode of that variability switches into the other mode.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Sir Brian </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Hoskins</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">At</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> a meeting in </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Downing Street</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> in the late 1980s I said that we could easily have a decade that would be cooler than the previous one and that would not mean the whole global warming thing had gone away.

It is absolutely not the way science works, of course not, and one of the benefits of the IPCC process is that it does encourage sharing between groups. As Brian mentioned, it means that we get many groups looking at results, model output and so forth, and that is obviously beneficial. Perhaps thanks to the IPCC, certainly when I talk to my colleagues in physics about the way other branches of physics operate and the way groups keep their results to themselves because they are terrified of somebody scooping them, I think that climate science is remarkably collegiate in the way it approaches problems. Maybe that is not true of every aspect </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">of climate science but certainly is in the mainstream modelling, observation, comparison work that I have been involved in.

Given that all the policy relevant stuff is based on the projections from models, I think that is a major concern.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> Are you saying that the models have somehow been twisted not to reflect the evidence that is available so far?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Nicholas Lewis</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: I would not say they have been twisted, but I do not think they reflect the current evidence. There was reference made in the first panel to the reduction in the aerosol cooling effect strength in AR5 compared with previous assessments due to better knowledge. In some ways that is the most significant thing in AR5 because if aerosol cooling is lower and, as Mr Lilley said, we would know how much warming there has been, then it must follow that less of that warming is attributable to carbon dioxide rather than being 1º or 1.3º attributable to carbon dioxide offset by 0.6º aerosol forcing. It is a much lower figure attributable to carbon dioxide. That was not recognised at the time when they started drafting AR5 and it certainly was not taken into account in the models, because they predate this reassessment of the evidence.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q53 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> Professor </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Lindzen</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">, I have seen a quotation from you saying that the small warming over the past 60 years is not a problem that is worth bothering about.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lindzen</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">: As always, one is a little bit cautious in the language.

Then we have 14 chapters condensed down to 31 pages and so, again, there is a whole other level of human judgment. Human judgment, of course, is not science. The science was way back at the beginning before the papers were written and then the chapters of the IPCC report were written and then the summary was written. If it were a scientific document, we would expect that the summary written by the scientists would be the last word and that is what would be released to the media and the policymakers, but instead it is almost like it is a summary by policymakers because then there is a four-day process where every single line in that summary written by the scientists is argued over and it is behind closed doors. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">It is very fine for the panel before us to say, “It is all above board and, no, there is no political pressure”, but we are supposed to just take their word for it.

There would be a statement, “Should you say that? Should you not say that?” That still allows you to trace it back to the text.

Everybody talks about politicians but the one thing that neither you nor the previous group have talked about is the influence of business and who pays for Mr Lewis’s research, who pays for your university and who organises to pay for your books, as well as who pays the gentlemen who were speaking before you for their work.
