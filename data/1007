The Joint Committee has requested an assessment of the policy proposals currently before it, as well as suggestions for alternative approaches to prisoner voting. In answering this request we focus on the philosophical arguments for and against the disenfranchisement of prisoners (Additional Question 1 in the Committee’s Call for Evidence). We explain, in Section 1, why the right to vote is important (thus also answering, in part, Additional Question 2). In Section 2 we explain why depriving prisoners of voting rights may in principle be a justifiable form of punishment (Additional Question 3). In Section 3 we highlight the negative effects of disenfranchising prisoners on the quality of our collective political decision-making and on the legitimacy of our political institutions. In Section 4 we assess the current policy proposals before the committee on the basis of the previous </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">arguments.

The Value of the Right to Vote</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">3. It is an essential element of liberal-democratic political morality that the state owes equal concern and respect to each citizen.</span><a name="_ftnref2"></a><a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> In our view, the significance of the right to vote is ultimately based on three grounds related to this fundamental moral commitment. First, universal enfranchisement improves the quality of our political decision-making, by protecting individual interests from unjust violations, by holding accountable office holders, and by fostering discussion and deliberation that yield better solutions to the complex political problems we face. As such, it benefits all citizens. Second, the right to vote benefits the person whose right it is in particular, mainly because it symbolically asserts that she is someone who counts, someone to whom equal concern and respect is owed. Third, under circumstances where the state’s legitimate authority cannot rest on the actual consent of its subjects, the opportunity for equal political participation in the democratic process provides an alternative basis for the moral legitimacy of our political institutions.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">A. Quality of Decision-Making</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">4. Universal enfranchisement plays an important role in improving the quality of our collective decision-making. First, political participation serves an important self-protective function: Each citizen acts to guard, or speak for, those of her own interests that should be taken most seriously in political decision-making. Since justice requires that each person’s interests be counted, and that her most important interests be adequately protected, this minimizes the risk that Parliament enacts unjust laws. Second, political participation fosters accountability, and prevents public officials from abusing their power for private purposes. Finally, political participation even by someone whose views are quite mistaken serves to improve the quality of both her and other people’s deliberation, and thus ultimately collective decision-making. The participant, by discussing her views with others, may acquire a better grasp of their needs and interests, and learn to identify more deeply with the common good. But even if her views do not improve, other citizens may benefit from engaging with her: As John Stuart Mill famously pointed out, by listening to the views of others and defending our arguments against their objections (however mistaken), we develop a deeper grasp of our own convictions and likely reach more valid opinions.</span><a name="_ftnref3"></a><a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">  Finally, as a number of political theorists have shown, a greater variety of perspectives is often beneficial for solving the complex problems we regularly face in politics.</span><a name="_ftnref4"></a><a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">5. It might be argued that most of the benefits just described do not require the right to vote. They only require an opportunity to contribute to democratic deliberation, an opportunity protected by the right to speak on political matters in public, to write letters to the editor of a newspaper, and so on. But this overlooks that the ultimate decision-makers (whether other voters or MPs) have much greater incentives to pay attention to the views of those whose votes count. And since a speaker who knows others will listen has greater reason to carefully formulate and advance her own ideas, it also motivates the speaker to improve her deliberation. So even if the right to vote is not strictly necessary to realize the benefits </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">discussed, it makes a very useful contribution to achieving them. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">6. None of this is to deny that there may be particular instances of enfranchisement where its positive effects on the outcome of our political decision-making are absent or outweighed. It is widely accepted that those below the age of 18 need not be enfranchised. The most plausible justification for this claim is that children and younger adolescents lack the intellectual and emotional maturity necessary to make good use of the power over our fellow citizens each of us exercises by voting. We return in Section 3 to the question whether a similar argument could justify prisoner disenfranchisement. But it is worth observing here that democratic states have adopted a strong presumption that citizens above a certain age are capable of contributing effectively to collective decision-making – a presumption reflected in the fact that the right to vote (unlike, say, a driving permit) is not something we acquire only after passing a test. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">B. Public Affirmation of Status</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">7. The democratic presumption in favour of enfranchisement reflects in part a further, non-outcome-related dimension of the value of the franchise. The right to vote has great symbolic significance, serving as a “badge of dignity” that identifies its bearer as someone who counts.</span><a name="_ftnref5"></a><a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> First, by enfranchising someone we publicly affirm that her interests are worthy of the protection that the right to vote provides. Second, enfranchisement affirms that the voter is deemed competent enough to contribute to our collective decision-making. Each of us has an interest in receiving such public affirmation of our equal status.</span><a name="_ftnref6"></a><a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">C. Democratic Legitimacy</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">8. The right to vote also plays an important role in establishing the state’s moral right to exercise power over its subjects. Historically, the liberal-democratic political tradition has focused on consent as the proper basis of the state’s legitimate authority.</span><a name="_ftnref7"></a><a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> But as a matter of fact, very few of us have (or even could have) freely consented to the authority of our state. The opportunity for participation provided by the right to vote has been deemed a functional substitute for consent: those who have the right to vote and thus to participate in our collective decision-making may thereby have acquired a duty to obey the law, and liability to the state’s coercive power, that is (within certain limits) similar to that which would have followed from consent.</span><a name="_ftnref8"></a><a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> A state that seeks to minimize the risk of acting illegitimately thus has reason to enfranchise all citizens. Indeed, if (as many philosophers think) human rights are those rights that bear especially on the state’s legitimacy, then the link between voting and legitimacy explains why the franchise is often deemed a human right.</span><a name="_ftnref9"></a><a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">2. Losing the Right to Vote</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">9. The previous discussion explains why voting is something to which citizens are presumptively entitled, and not merely a privilege generously granted by a benevolent sovereign. But we must not assume that citizens therefore cannot lose the right to vote under </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">any circumstances. Rights are rarely absolute or unconditional. They can be overridden or waived or forfeited. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">10. Nor must we assume, however, that we can establish the justifiability of prisoner disenfranchisement by showing that democratic legislatures have the right to remove the franchise from certain groups if they so decide in accordance with properly established democratic procedures.</span><a name="_ftnref10"></a><a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> The claim that democracies have the right to disenfranchise some citizens may be true, at least within certain limits. But that Parliament has the power to disenfranchise some prisoners does not tell us whether it should exercise that power. What we want to know is whether there are good reasons for disenfranchising offenders – what the principled justification for doing so might be. The question is: Considering the significance that the right to vote has, are there circumstances in which removing the right to vote from some or all prisoners would be justifiable? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">11. One important distinction to bear in mind is whether (a) disenfranchisement is an intentionally imposed deprivation for purposes of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">punishment</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">, or whether (b) the removal of voting rights is carried out because the offender is judged </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">no longer to qualify</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> for the franchise. (In the latter case offenders would be like children, who also lack the right to vote yet are not being punished for any wrongdoing.) We believe that the most powerful arguments in favour of disenfranchising prisoners treat such disenfranchisement as a form of legitimate punishment. It is on such punitive justifications that we focus in this section. The question whether offenders lack the qualifications required for the franchise will be considered again in the next section. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">12. Philosophical discussions of punishment commonly distinguish four legitimate ends for which punishment may be inflicted: incapacitation, rehabilitation, deterrence, and retribution.</span><a name="_ftnref11"></a><a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> Only the last of these is a plausible philosophical basis for disenfranchising a significant portion of the prison population. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">13. Removal of the vote incapacitates offenders in the sense that they cannot do harm through voting. However, the risk of such harm is usually very low. Furthermore, incapacitation of this sort is justified only if there is a good reason for thinking that the prisoner would commit harm through voting. This is most plausibly the case where the crime for which she was convicted was itself voting-related. This would, however, only cover a very minimal number of offenders every year. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">14. We believe that disenfranchisement is unlikely to have a significant deterrence effect. If the offender is to be deterred by the threat of disenfranchisement, she must be conscious of this threat, and many are not. Furthermore, the significance most offenders attach to the right to vote will be small as compared to the significance they attach to freedom from imprisonment. So it is doubtful that disenfranchisement adds much, if anything, to the deterrence effect of a custodial sentence.</span><a name="_ftnref12"></a><a href="#_ftn12">[12]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> We are also unconvinced that disenfranchisement plays a positive role in rehabilitating offenders. Rehabilitation works, it might be said, when offenders take an interest in wider society, but disenfranchisement discourages them from doing so.</span><a name="_ftnref13"></a><a href="#_ftn13">[13]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> These are, however, empirical questions that must ultimately be answered by criminologists and psychologists. We thus set aside these issues in our discussion. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">15. The most powerful argument for disenfranchisement appeals to its </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">symbolic value</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">. Symbolism has its importance, and it is in some respects natural to think that violation of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">some fundamental binding standard should be followed by withdrawal of normal treatment. The aim of this is not necessarily to teach any lessons, or protect democracy, but simply to symbolise condemnation of the crime by disassociating ourselves from the offender and his acts.</span><a name="_ftnref14"></a><a href="#_ftn14">[14]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">16. Democratic citizens are not simply bearers of rights. They also have responsibilities. If these responsibilities are violated, other citizens may reasonably resent these violations, and disassociate themselves from the violators by depriving them of some of the elements of the status associated with democratic citizenship. What democratic responsibilities have prisoners violated, and which violations justify the expressive condemnation achieved by disenfranchisement? It is often thought that prisoners have violated the social contract simply by disobeying the law. But this formalistic understanding of democratic responsibilities is implausible, since it cannot explain why prisoners, but not other law-breakers (for instance, drivers caught speeding), should be disenfranchised. A more plausible account focuses on the responsibility of democratic citizens to show concern and respect for their fellow citizens. An offender who commits a serious crime shows significant disregard or disrespect for the victim. As fellow members of the democratic community we have reason to condemn this offence, and to affirm our solidarity with the victim, by disassociating ourselves from the offender.</span><a name="_ftnref15"></a><a href="#_ftn15">[15]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> One way in which we can do so is by disenfranchising her, thus depriving her of the benefit she derives when, through the franchise, she is publicly affirmed as an equal citizen. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">3. The Normative Costs of Disenfranchising Prisoners</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">17. Disenfranchising someone who has violated her democratic responsibilities may be one way of expressing the condemnation that the crime deserves. But to determine whether disenfranchisement is ultimately justified we must take into account not only the harm deservedly inflicted on the offender, but also the costs that our punishment imposes on innocent third parties – here, on other citizens and on our political institutions. Universal enfranchisement is justified, we explained earlier, not only by the benefits that the right to vote provides to its bearer, but also, and more importantly, by the effects that the right to vote has on the quality of collective decision-making and the legitimacy of state action. Each of these provides reasons against disenfranchising prisoners. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">A. Effects on the Quality of Democratic Decision-Making</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">18. Those who have the right to vote can use it to guard their most important interests, and their contributions to public discussion and deliberation are more likely to be considered by other citizens. Each of these improves the quality of our collective decision-making, something in which each citizen, and not only the voter whose right is at issue, has an interest. By depriving prisoners of voting rights we thus set back the interests of other citizens. This cost to innocent third parties is a reason to limit disenfranchisement of prisoners to rare cases. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">19. It might be objected that the general argument for the collective benefits of enfranchisement does not apply to offenders, just as it does not justify the enfranchisement of children. First, offenders are more likely to lack certain epistemic, cognitive, and emotional skills that enable them to make good use of the vote: they are, for instance, impulsive and </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">present-oriented.</span><a name="_ftnref16"></a><a href="#_ftn16">[16]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> (Call this the competency argument.) Second, those who have committed a crime have thereby shown that they prioritize their own private interests over the interests of others or the public good. (Call this the selfishness argument.) Proponents of these arguments might conclude that avoiding the negative impact on the quality of our democratic decisions that the votes of offenders would have justifies their disenfranchisement. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">20. Even if the psychological assumption behind the competency argument were true, it would not follow that our collective decision-making would be improved by disenfranchising offenders. The epistemic benefits of one citizen’s contributions depend primarily on the effects they have on the views and votes of others, rather than on the individual voter’s character traits or the quality of her conclusions. Even if an individual voter’s judgments are unreliable and ill-considered, collective decision-making as a whole will often benefit from her participation if it forces others to grapple more deeply with their own judgments and thus reach better conclusions. Furthermore, even if prisoners are bad at assessing the public good, their own interests count when it comes to determining what justice requires. Since they do have a good grasp of their own interests and there is no reason to believe that others will adequately represent them, the risk of unjust laws is reduced by enfranchising prisoners. This last observation also explains why the arguments that may justify the disenfranchisement of children do not justify the disenfranchisement of prisoners: Unlike prisoners, children are usually assumed to lack a reliable grasp of their own best interests. And again unlike prisoners, children have someone – their parents – who will quite reliably fight for their interests. So children, but not prisoners, will normally be better served by having someone else represent their interests in our collective decision-making. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">21. The selfishness argument is similarly weak. As long as prisoners are a very small part of the electorate, they are unlikely to succeed in advancing their own self-interest unless they can convince enough of their fellow citizens that these interests are in fact worthy of advancement or protection. This imposes a significant limit on the threat that their purported selfishness can pose to the quality of electoral outcomes. There have been concerns that offenders may form voting ‘blocs’, and thus advance their own illegitimate interests at the expense of law-abiding citizens. However, in the UK this problem could be easily avoided by having offenders vote in the constituency they resided in at the time of the offence and thus ‘dispersing’ the offender vote. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">B. Effects on the Legitimacy of Political Institutions</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">22. The right to vote is also significant because it plays a role in legitimizing the state’s exercise of power over its subjects. As we explained earlier, the opportunity for equal political participation serves as a functional equivalent of the consent on which the state’s legitimacy has historically been thought to rest, and which we now recognize states normally have not received. A state concerned with the legitimacy of its exercise of power thus has reason to enfranchise offenders to minimize the risk of acting illegitimately. Notice that the problem is not with the state’s exercise of power while the offender is in prison: during that period, the state’s actions are justified insofar as they are legitimate punishment for the offender’s past wrongs. The problem is, rather, that the offender, once released, will be living under laws in the making of which she was not permitted to participate. If, as many of us believe, the state’s right to exercise power over us depends on its granting us a democratic say, then excluding prisoners casts a stain on the authority the laws can claim over them. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">23. We conclude that disenfranchising prisoners is likely to come at an epistemic cost to our collective decision-making and to increase the risk that our laws are unjust or otherwise </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">suboptimal. Furthermore, disenfranchisement casts doubt on the legitimate authority of our state institutions, which depends on the democratic character of our political processes. In light of the costs disenfranchisement thus imposes on third parties and political institutions, we should disenfranchise only those offenders whose crimes are especially serious, and from whom we should disassociate ourselves most urgently.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">4. Assessment of the Government’s Proposed Policies</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">24. The Committee is currently considering three options: </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">(a) Disqualifying prisoners sentenced to four years or more in prison from voting. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">(b) Disqualifying prisoners sentenced to more than six months in prison from voting. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">(c) Disqualifying all prisoners serving custodial sentences from voting. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">In light of the previous arguments, we conclude that Option (a) is the most justifiable. The costs that disenfranchising prisoners imposes on innocent third parties, and the constraints it imposes on the state’s claim to legitimately exercising power over the offenders once they are released, explain why we should limit disenfranchisement as a form of punishment to those cases where the offence committed was so severe that it requires an expression of condemnation that goes beyond that associated with incarceration. A four-year sentence is a much more reliable proxy that a very serious crime has been committed than the shorter periods of time suggested by Options (b) and (c).</span><a name="_ftnref17"></a><a href="#_ftn17">[17]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">25. An even better solution, we believe, would be to adopt a general rule according to which prisoners are not permitted to vote except in the last election before they are released. Since the gap between general elections may be up to five years, it follows that offenders sentenced to no more than five years in prison would not lose the right to vote, since any election that occurs during their imprisonment could be the last before they re-enter society. Those convicted for longer periods of time would be disenfranchised for all but the last five years of their sentence. This rule, like the four-year rule currently before the Committee, ensures that only those who have committed very serious crimes are in fact disenfranchised. In addition, it meets two further desiderata. First, it might foster rehabilitation: As opponents of disenfranchisement have pointed out, it might lead to further alienation between offender and society. By contrast, by allowing offenders to vote in the last election before their release, we invite them to slowly rejoin the community of democratic citizens, with all of the rights and responsibilities this includes. Second, this rule would solve the problem of democratic legitimacy pointed out above: because the offenders had a chance to participate as equals in electoral politics prior to rejoining society, our political institutions have the same legitimate authority over them that they have over all other citizens. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-indent:14.4pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">June 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><br style="page-break-before:always; clear:both" /><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Bibliography</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; orphans:0; text-indent:-36pt; widows:0"><a name="_ENREF_1"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Altman, Andrew. 2005.

This would minimize the risk that considerations unrelated to the severity of the crime, but relevant to the determination of the length of a custodial sentence, influence whether the offender is disenfranchised. Thus neither considerations that reduce the length of the custodial sentence independently of the severity of the crime (say, the offender’s age or medical condition) nor considerations that extend it (for instance, the need to extend imprisonment for the sake of public safety) should bear on disenfranchisement. We believe others are more competent to defend this alternative proposal, and thus do not further consider it here.</span></p></body></html>
