UNICEF’s work internationally highlights that when children understand the risks faced by them from climate change and are included in decision making, they are able to help shape policy that truly protects them from climate change. For example, in the Philippines, UNICEF has run education programmes about climate change with children, highlighting the risks they face from climate related natural hazards such as cyclones. Following this children were consulted on government climate change adaptation strategies where they were able to cite their concerns and the risks they faced. This meant the climate change policy developed by the local government addressed the concerns of children, key stakeholders, but could also effectively protect them.</span><a name="_ftnref3"></a><a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">3.4 The UK Department of Energy and Climate Change’s youth panel, which UNICEF UK actively supported, also showed the benefits of including children and young people in climate change decision making.
