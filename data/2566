We are a practitioner organisation and our members deliver legal aid services on the ground to clients day in, day out. We would therefore</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt"> like to draw attention to the practical effect of this proposal on clients and access to justice. Clients seeking legal advice on areas which remain within scope of LASPOA are, in the main, due to the refocusing of legal aid on priority areas, those seeki</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">ng advice regarding protection of the person or their home. The eligible client group is therefore by definition more vulnerable than previously. Already there have been additional burdensome requirements placed on clients to produce evidence to prove thei</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">r eligibility and that their case falls within the scope of the new legal aid scheme. The more hurdles put in the path of vulnerable clients, the harder it is to reach the point where any advice is accessible and offered. Legal Action Group has highlighted</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt"> the drop in the number of people obtaining advice – the reduction is far greater than the effect of LASPOA:  </span><a href="http://www.lag.org.uk/policy-campaigns/legal-aid-secret-service.aspx"><span style="color:#0000ff; font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; text-decoration:underline">http://www.lag.org.uk/policy-campaigns/legal-aid-secret-service.</span><span style="color:#0000ff; font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; text-decoration:underline">aspx</span></a></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">8.

As prac</span><span style="color:#000000; font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">titioners have over the last few years been stringently audited on this requirement by the Legal Aid Agency and often had payments disallowed retrospectively and extrapolations made across their other cases, lawyers are having to be very strict about who t</span><span style="color:#000000; font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">hey see and ensure that evidence is collected and stored. The less flexible the LAA is to cases of doubt, and the more stringent the requirements are to produce certain types of evidence, the more risk averse practitioners will be. The requirements extend </span><span style="color:#000000; font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">to producing original (not copy) bank statements, proving the source of funding for food and light/heating, and payments in and out of their accounts. Many clients cannot meet these more stringent </span><span style="color:#000000; font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">requirements and so are not provided with advice at all.

It is essential to highlight the effect on those seeking redress through judicial review - the system is of cou</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">rse designed for individuals to enforce rights, and not to ensure a good income for lawyers. However rights do not exist in a vacuum. We would highlight one practical issue of all of the recent legal aid cuts – the inability of legal aid practitioners to c</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">arry out an ever increasing amount of work unpaid or ‘at risk’. Already legal aid fees are below what is understood to be ‘the market rate’ (for example for much civil legal aid the rates are those set in 1994, less the 10% cut imposed in October 2011) but</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt"> that does not explain the real cost of carrying out legal aid work. There is already considerable unpaid time which people will refer to in this response e</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">g.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">checking financial eligibility, helping clients obtain evidence of domestic violence, filling in</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt"> the exceptional funding form, but also the unremitting complexity of the revised legal aid system means that it would be quite easy to work a ten hour day and only produce five definite chargeable hours which might be paid.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">20</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">. As a membership organisation we know the pressures our members are under and we can confirm that the line has been reached where no further cuts to even the low levels of funding can be </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">sustained. The rest of the work carried out by firms does not suppor</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">t cross-subsidisation of unpaid or at risk legal aid work. The ‘concession’ of a discretionary payment if the case settles pre permission but costs are not paid by the opponent will not help to ensure that practitioners can carry out legal aid work. This i</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">s because such work cannot reach that stage without guarantees of some payment, even at low legal aid rates.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">21. It is important to explain that judicial review cases, unlike other types of litigation, involve extensive work in the early stages to prepare </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">the case for issue. Other litigation can start with a simple application form and short statement, and the costs are very low. This is not the case for most judicial reviews, because what is required in bringing proceedings is a detailed document setting o</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">ut the legal grounds of challenge, supported by full evidence. The duty to the Court to make full disclosure from the start of the case means that the work is very heavy and labour intensive in the early stages of the case. All of this work will be at risk</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt"> if the proposal proceeds, and the result will be that practitioners simply will not take the risk of either not being granted permission (because for example, a third party takes some action outside the practitioner’s control rendering the proceedings aca</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">demic) or not receiving the discretionary payment from the Legal Aid Agency.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">22. There is a simple solution. The LAA is legally and contractually responsible for considering legal aid applications for judicial review, applying the relevant Merits Regulatio</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">ns and criteria, and deciding which cases warrant public funding to take forward. Only meritorious cases should succeed. Moreover the Judge, on considering permission, and in refusing permission in those cases could certify that the case was ‘wholly withou</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">t merit’ and recommend that the practitioner’s costs should not be paid. We do not think that political rhetoric should overturn this procedure.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">23. To allow the LAA to have the discretion on payment, when the exceptional funding cases have been so limited</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">, would be unlikely to persuade practitioners to take the risk. Valid cases, particularly those which are complex and therefore cost more initially to bring to permission, will simply not be brought at all. The Public Law Project has carried out considerab</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">le work on Judicial Review trends and we urge the Committee to consider their findings. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">24. We do urge the Committee to consider fully the importance of judicial review as a way for ordinary citizens (some of whose dependence on the state for assistance m</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">eans that they would be severely affected by this proposal) to challenge large organisations and that that is important constitutionally.
