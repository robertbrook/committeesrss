In answer to the questions posed (i.e. is the data accurate?) the response would be that most forces endeavour to meet the National Crime Recording Standards and the</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> Home Office Counting Rules and adhere to high standards of ethical recording practices. However the more pertinent question seems to be whether data can be compared between forces with confidence (i.e. is the data reliable). The answer to this is almost c</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ertainly not. There is a degree of flexibility in the system currently that whilst recording in accordance with the guidance set out in the National Crime Recording Standards and within agreed time frames there are significant differences in how the result</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ing data is interpreted. For example with regard to when a crime is recorded, in Devon and Cornwall we direct record (as soon as an offence is disclosed it is recorded on the crime system and is not necessarily recorded first on the incident management sys</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">tem). This means that if we subsequently discover that no offence was committed we have to provide evidence that no offence took place before we can no-crime. In terms of comparison to other forces this means that not only do we have a higher no-crime rate</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> than might otherwise be expected but also that more offences remain on the record than might be the case for other forces who conduct some early investigation to corroborate the occurrence of an offence. In addition how each force interprets the NCRS can </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">vary slightly but significantly, for example the line between anti-social behaviour (a non-crime incident), public disorder (an offence against society) and low level violence (a victim-based crime) is very blurred. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="2" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 13.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">What are the factors which can influe</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">nce police mis-recording of crime?</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Politics – an issue or offence that is high on the national or local political agenda may influence the tendency of either individuals or organisations to record an offence in a certain way.
