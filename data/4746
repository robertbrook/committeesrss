This is the Committee’s regular session taking evidence from the Secretary of State. We intended to do one last year, but we spared the Secretary of State because she had only been in post for about two weeks and it seemed a little premature. I welcome Maria Miller to her first appearance as Secretary of State on a general brief—we talked about press regulation a few weeks ago.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Perhaps I can start off. The number of staff employed by your Department has fallen dramatically. Do you think that that has had any impact on the effectiveness of the Department or on its ability to conduct its remit? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Maria Miller:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Clearly, Chair, we have had significant challenges as a Government in ensuring that our budgets are sustainable in the long term. As a Department, we felt that it was important that when we addressed that problem we did everything we could to ensure that the money—the public funding—reached the front lines and the services that make a difference, particularly in the areas of culture, media and sport, but also in our responsibilities of equality and women’s issues. To minimise the impact on those budgets, we felt that it was important to take a long, hard look at the structure of our Department. I have read through the comments my predecessor made to you when he appeared before the Select Committee, and they paint an accurate picture. We wanted to ensure that we reduced administration costs in the Department to maximise the amount of money that goes out to arm’s length bodies, the other bodies we fund and all the other work we do.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I cannot say that it has been straightforward or easy. It has been difficult to implement the changes that we have put in place, but we have done it successfully. I pay particular tribute to the staff of my Department, who have gone through significant reorganisation this year and have come out of it in very good form indeed. Part of the answer, Chair, is that we have used our arm’s length bodies—organisations that are experts in the work they do. The challenge for the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Department is how to continue to use our arm’s length bodies as sources of expertise to inform the policy development we do in the Department. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You have been there for a year and had the chance to think about the role of the Department. This is a perennial question, but do you remain of the view that there needs to be a DCMS? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Maria Miller:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think, Mr Whittingdale, that what we have done in the past 12 months is proof that my Department is absolutely at the heart of the Government’s economic growth agenda. Of course, culture, arts and heritage define who we are as citizens, and they have an intrinsic value in their own right. That, in itself, is reason enough to have a Department for Culture, Media and Sport. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Over and above that, we have proved the Department’s economic worth, too. The days of special pleading for the Department are well and truly over, and I think that came through strongly in the spending review round in which I was involved. We demonstrated very clearly the value to the country of the Department’s work in terms of issues such as driving tourism and attracting people to come to the country and, over and above that, ensuring that culture and the arts are recognised as the soft power force that they are. The Department’s work also presents </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Britain</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> as a strong player overseas in our developing export markets, which was perhaps most ably demonstrated by the important role of the Department and the creative industries in the Prime Minister’s recent delegation to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">China</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, where we played a very strong role in cementing an important trip for our </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> industries.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q3</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you feel that the restructuring that you have talked about has now been completed, or would you see further changes?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Maria Miller:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The restructuring is in place, although we are still finalising the staff who will take up those positions. I would like to point out to the Committee that, although the overall headcount has reduced, we have considered the Department’s structure, so we have reintroduced a director general-level individual to provide more strategic oversight for the Department and we have restructured BDUK, which as you know has an important role within the Department for delivering the Government’s most important infrastructure plan. We have restructured BDUK to increase the seniority of the management within that part of the Department.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q4</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Is the director general separate from the permanent secretary?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Maria Miller:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Correct.

The permanent secretary is there to ensure that the Department is running soundly on a staffing level and a financial level and, yes, to provide strategic oversight. Up until this point we had no director general-level staff in the Department, and I felt that we could very </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">much benefit from somebody who can provide additional management support to the permanent secretary. I think that will prove to be a very valuable addition to the Department.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You have referred to your vast range of different responsibilities, and we will move through those, if we may. First, we will talk about perhaps one of the most controversial responsibilities.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q6</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Paul Farrelly:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Press regulation. The charter was granted on 30 October. Will you tell us what has happened since the charter was granted along the road to setting up a recognition body?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Maria Miller:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes, of course. I am delighted to do that, and I am sure that many members of the Committee will have been following it closely. Since the charter was put to the Privy Council and approved, there has been a process whereby the charter had to be sealed. We are not particularly in control of those processes, which are set by the Privy Council Office. The charter was sealed earlier this month, and since that point we have been able to commence finalising the details of the work that will be done by Sir David </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Normington</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> to appoint the chair of the Recognition Panel. It is clearly important to get that process right. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I had, prior to the sealing of the charter, a meeting with Sir David Normington to discuss some of the challenges that that would present to his organisation. We have had to take some time to finalise the procedures that will be followed, because, as the Committee is aware, the Government feel that it is important that this is done outwith the Government. We had to finalise issues around funding for the work that was being done, which had not been accounted for within Sir David’s organisation.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q7</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Paul Farrelly:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So it took a number of weeks for some wax to be applied.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Maria Miller:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> With respect, it is not really to do with the wax; it is much more to do with the processes that the Privy Council Office follows. I am sure that they would be able to talk to you more fully about that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q8</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Paul Farrelly:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I understand that the Commissioner for Public Appointments needs a letter for him to start the appointments process.

I apologise, Mr Chairman, because I have been out of the country for the past two days, but it has either just gone or it is about to go. I have certainly seen the draft. It is important for the Committee to understand that we have taken the decision that the Government should not have an involvement in the establishment of the Recognition Panel. Our involvement started and finished with the establishment of the charter, and now it is for others to take that forward, whether it is through the Independent Press Standards Organisation on the press self-regulation side, or whether it is through the Director of Public Appointments on the Recognition Panel. It will take a little time to be able to be confident that we have got things established as they should </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">be. As the Committee knows, the process has been going on for some months, and perhaps years.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q9</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Paul Farrelly:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So the Commissioner for Public Appointments will have that letter before Christmas, will he?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Maria Miller:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I would say yes.

Rightly, until the charter is sealed, it is not possible for us to enter into those final discussions with the commissioner, although as I indicated, I had a meeting with him a little while ago to discuss whether in principle there would be any problems with his performing this role. As you have already indicated, it required us to clarify his remit and clarify how his functions will be funded. Of course, I always hope that these things can be carried out swiftly, but inevitably, given the nature of the organisations, it does take a little time to resolve. As you have said, it was 30 October when the charter was approved by the Privy Council, so it has not exactly been a long period of time between then and now to get an important process refined and established.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q11</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Paul Farrelly:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> But we had months and months of delay beforehand.

It is not only the process of establishing the Recognition Panel; it is also about its working at arm’s length and very much separate from the Government. The last thing I would want to do was request Sir David to start his work and then for it not to have been thought through well enough for it to be able to be concluded. This is important and we have taken the necessary time to get it right.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q12</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Paul Farrelly:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Meanwhile, the industry is pressing ahead with its own regulator.

Now, the Committee may agree or disagree with me—it is for Members to determine this themselves—but I think both the Prime Minister and I, earlier this year, made it very clear indeed that the Conservative party would never be in the position where we would want to see statutory regulation of the press. So if you are indicating that you would want to see a process where you would have to mandate the press to be involved in this charter approach, then you would in essence be advocating mandatory statutory regulation of the press, and that is not something I could agree with you on.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q14</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Paul Farrelly:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So what is Government policy?

That is pretty clear. If people choose not to seek recognition that is their choice, but ultimately they will not be able to benefit from the costs advantages that they would get if they were within the system. I cannot make it any clearer than that. It is ultimately for the press to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">decide how they wish to operate in this sphere. What I say I am pleased about is that there is a very clear willingness and understanding of the need to move forward on this; and yes, I am very content with the fact that IPSO is moving forward in a way which has got a great deal of support from the industry.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Paul Farrelly:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I have got one final question, Chair, before I hand over to colleagues.

You have met the people who are involved in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">IPSO</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.

My recollection of events is that the Prime Minister and I had agreed that there was a clear way forward, that that had been given to the Labour party and that they had then, over that weekend, gone into some sort of negotiation—we thought perhaps it was with themselves, but it now transpires it was with Hacked Off—to come out with an agreed position. I think it therefore must have been the Labour party who invited Hacked Off to their meeting, but that is only my supposition, because, obviously, it was their meeting. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">36</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Conor Burns:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You would concede, I imagine—you indicated as much on the Floor of the House—that the fact that Hacked Off was present at the meeting, which was the birthing of the royal charter concept, while the press were not, added to the suspicion and absence of good will on the press’s part regarding that process. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Maria Miller:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I certainly think that it proved to be deeply unhelpful. I have to say that we had been working closely with Harriet Harman prior to that point. I thought we had, through very exhaustive and extensive meetings over a number of months, got to a position where—referring back to my previous comments—an effective system was going to take the press and the public with us. I thought we had reached that stage before that weekend. I think it was a great shame that that was not more sensitively handled, and it became quite a destructive force in the perceptions of the press. It took a great deal of work to get things back on track, and I hope, through some of the amendments I put in place to the charter, that some of that good will was re-established with the press. But, unfortunately, there was some lasting damage. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">37</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Conor Burns:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> When you look at the terms of the Independent Press Standards Organisation, the press have travelled an amazing distance down the road from where we thought they might be at the beginning of this process, 18 months ago.

Let’s remember that when the Conservative party put forward the idea of a charter, this was not something that was accepted by either the Labour party or, indeed, others in Parliament. It was certainly not something that was accepted by the press. Through a great deal of hard work, by Mr Oliver Letwin and myself, we managed to get to a stage where I believe we were on the verge of an agreement. I feel that some of the interventions around the weekend that you mention created a great deal of bad will and some changes that were very difficult. I think we have recaptured some of that position, but still there is some lasting damage there. I am an optimist on this; I really feel that we have a good position with the charter. It is something that is beneficial to all parties concerned—I do not mean political parties</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I mean parties, the industry and the consumer—and gives a system of redress when mistakes are made.

I can say from my own perspective that what we could see happening very clearly was the hijacking of Government business through amendments to impose statutory regulation of the press. That was not something that either the Prime Minister or I were willing to accept. It was very important for us to have in place something that would absolutely not see that happening. I think that that was a very difficult situation. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">39</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Conor Burns:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> In a sense, the logic of that is that the charter was born out of parliamentary arithmetic and the absence of a Conservative majority.

It was not something that I felt was at all the right answer—absolutely philosophically the wrong thing to do. I think that if we had not proceeded with the charter as an approach at that stage, there would have been a great deal of certainty in a coalition of different forces on the Floor of the House where that would have come into play. I think that would have been wholly wrong. I think that with the charter as it is now, amended since the fateful weekend—we tried to get back some of the very important provisions that are in there now—we are in a good place.

You said correctly that regulation of the press is not Government business. The charter is not Government business, but we have made it Parliament’s business. The Prime Minister has repeatedly heralded the fact that the charter could be amended in the future only by a two-thirds majority in both Houses of Parliament. What advice, guidance or clarification did the Prime </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Minister, your Department or others engaged in drafting that seek from the parliamentary Clerks as to its constitutional position? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Maria Miller:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> If I could just take a step back, the reason why that provision is important and why I think it is perhaps sometimes not quite understood is that, of course, if it wasn’t in there</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> the charter could have been amended by Privy Councillors without any discussion whatsoever. So that amendment actually is an important way that we put a lock on to the charter, so that it cannot be tampered with. I am sure that would not be the case with present Privy Councillors who are in Government, but we want to put in place a lock to ensure that that could not happen in the future. To my recollection, Mr Burns, and I can always write to you with a little bit more detail, that was very much in discussion with those people who would be able to advise us on the constitutional correctness of that.

So, you are right, of course, that a majority Government can pass any law that they like</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">indeed, of course, that would be the case</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—b</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">ut the principle there is to make sure that there is some protection for the charter, because it needs to be </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">there, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">and I think it is absolutely vitally important that when it comes to press freedom and ensuring the freedom of our press in this country is a critical part of our democracy, that we need to ensure that anything to do with the self-regulation or the oversight of the press is very much outwith the control of this Government. And I think that that is something that perhaps others don’t feel as strongly about, and hence they weren’t willing to press things so heavily in the House of Commons earlier this year, and it is only earlier this year that we are talking about. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">44</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Conor Burns:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I understand and accept that, but the way that that has been constantly presented—that it would require a two-thirds majority in both Houses of Parliament to change it at all—has given the impression that this is a sort of eternal lock, as it were.

We have certainly seen a significant increase in participation in sport. I believe we are the first country to have achieved that and it is important. I particularly draw the Committee’s attention to the most recent figures showing a significant increase in participation among disabled people in sport, which I think is a real testament to the particular impact of last summer’s Paralympic games.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We have also seen, I think, a considerable legacy not just in the regeneration of the site of the Olympics and that part of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, but also in terms of the way </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Britain</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is viewed in the world.

Whichever country you visit, the cut-through that the Olympics had is really incredible.  Our reputation as a country was considerably enhanced through how the games were staged. Not only the opening ceremony, but the handling of the entire games</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">was, I think, seen as being a gold standard for others to reach in the future. I think that that legacy is strong and we should not underestimate it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q54</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tracey Crouch:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I want to drill down into some of those things because, as I say, the Olympic games themselves were spectacular and the hosting of the event was good for the UK in some respects. However, you mentioned the increase in participation in sport. Unfortunately, the only figures we really get to see compare participation rates today with 2005. Can you disaggregate those and make a comparison with what it was looking like in 2012? I suspect that there wasn’t such a giant leap in participation—just perhaps nudging those who were already inclined to participate in sport actually to get out there and do so.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Maria Miller:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> And I know, Ms Crouch, that you have huge expertise in the area of sport and are personally involved yourself. You will know that the sorts of changes that we want to see </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">in British society, in terms of participation in sport and becoming an even more active nation, are not going to happen over a 12-month or 24-month period, but will be part of a long-term legacy from these games.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I think it is absolutely right that we look at the long-term impact of becoming the host nation, as well as the impact of the games itself. Going back to 2005 is the right thing to do because I think that was when the country became gripped with the anticipation of what this might mean. The games themselves certainly created additional momentum, and I was in a gym club quite recently in my own constituency hearing how its participation rates had significantly jumped since the Olympics. They felt very strongly that this was directly as a result of the excitement and the anticipation around the games, but I think it is right that we look at those figures over a longer period of time. Indeed, I think Lord Coe would even say that we won’t see the full legacy of the Olympic games—whether it is in participation or in other respects—for a 10-year period. So I think that looking at the period between 2005 to date is important, but actually the long-term impact of legacy, particularly around participation, we probably won’t see until we get to 2022.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q55</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tracey Crouch:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It is interesting that you say that, because we often talk about how the televising of major events encourages people immediately to rush out to the tennis courts after Wimbledon, or on to the football pitches after the World cup. Why are you saying that about the legacy of the Olympics, which was obviously on our televisions for a significant period of time, which was across both genders and which involved multiple sports, events and activities? Why are we therefore not seeing that immediate jump into participation into some of those sports and events?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Maria Miller:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What we need to recognise is that we are trying to generate not a short-term fix, but a long-term habit for life. We can focus, as you have done, on the participation figures, but I will also focus on the very strong plans that we have for supporting increased participation at school level, with the additional funding that we have recently announced. I think the short answer to your question is that we don’t want a short-term fix; we want a long-term habit for life. It is important that we do not just look at 12-month figures—or indeed 24-month figures—but look over a longer period of time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q56</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tracey Crouch:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I can accept that in some part, but only last week the Department published figures showing that 15.5 million people were playing sport once a week and championed it as an increase of more than 1.5 million since 2005. The participation rates for playing sport once a week are still incredibly important, so we should be seeing an immediate reaction and response to things like the Olympics and Paralympics. We should have seen a spike in the figures over the past 12 months, but I suspect we have not.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Maria Miller:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> As I say, the goal of the legacy is to see not simply short-term spikes, but that increase over a longer period of time. I think that that is when legacy starts to prove itself. Simply seeing short-term gain will not necessarily lead to the sort of habit changes that we need.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q57</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tracey Crouch:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you think the legacy is London-centric?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Maria Miller:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Certainly not in terms of participation. One of the direct programmes that we have as part of our legacy programme is particularly around increasing women’s participation in sport. We have a pilot in Bury at the moment to look at how we can maximise that participation, but in a non-London way. My Department is certainly very focused on the importance of driving participation throughout the country. Indeed, the Sport England participation strategies are </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and Wales-wide. Our programme reflects the importance of increasing participation in whatever part of the country.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q58</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tracey Crouch:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You briefly mentioned that I am involved in sport—indeed I am, at the grass-roots level—but we have not seen any significant increase in participation at grass roots.

We have put £150 million a year into schools and we have extended it by a further year, so I think some £400 million in total is going into that project. We will help to ensure that from primary school age we have the expertise going into exciting youngsters about sport at a time when we need to get them hooked, excited and active in their lives, but it is then about keeping that going through secondary school, particularly among young women. That is why I welcome the changes in the curriculum recognising the importance of having choice, especially for young women, and taking part in different sorts of sports to get them and keep them active. That and the Sport England £1 billion plan for grass-roots activity in our communities all add together to provide an extensive programme to make sure that we are a nation of active people.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q59</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tracey Crouch:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I am keen to ask some detailed questions on school sports, but keeping on the Olympics at the moment, there is a Cabinet committee that is tasked with co-ordinating the Olympic legacy.

What is more important is that Ministers are actively involved in legacy as part of their day-to-day work. I very much welcome the commitment from my colleagues throughout a wide range of Departments to delivering on the Olympic legacy, whether that is through our schools Department—I have already outlined some of the work we are doing at school level—or, indeed, through the work of our communities Department.

There is no mystery at all. Indeed, I should also mention that the Mayor and the Mayor’s office are very active participants in our Olympic legacy committee. We meet very regularly and have a clear plan of action set out by our five key themes of legacy. That is very open and available. In fact, the Sports Minister produces a regular report to Parliament on the progress that we are making, particularly on the sports legacy of the Olympics, so we are actually very transparent and open about the workings of the committee. I would like to thank all my colleagues, particularly the Mayor, for the incredible work that we are doing.

You used the word “traditional,” which I don’t think reflects the situation as it is. We have had a reform of the curriculum for school sports, importantly recognising that there is need for a broader scope of sports in schools, particularly to keep young women involved in sports who may not be that interested in competitive sports. We are putting more emphasis in the curriculum on non-competitive sports. I very much welcome that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">You talked about school sports partnerships. I think that there was not the success that we needed to see given the investment levels for those partnerships. What I am pleased to see not is not only the investment that has been put in, particularly at primary school level through the primary school sports premium, but the clear recognition that the best schools are doing sports well. That is what we should be seeing in schools across the board. Indeed, Ofsted now has a very clear role, particularly at primary school level, in seeing how that premium is used. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q65</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tracey Crouch:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> School sports partnerships were not perfect, but they did offer variety and there were fantastic examples, particularly within women’s sport, about how girls were being offered things like Arabian dance lessons which got them involved in physical activity. The Secretary of State mocked and condemned that at the time as a misuse of school sports partnership funding and said that that should be focused more on things like rugby, football, netball and hockey. Do you not agree that what is really important is to ensure that we do have that diversity and variety in schools and, if that is not available in schools, the specialist clubs should be accessible to those who wish to participate?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Maria Miller:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Actions speak very loudly in this respect.

I do not think that that would be effective at all. You are right to say that we believe that successful schools have strong policies when it comes to sports and activities for young people of all ages. We have to be clear that that is the sign of a successful school: one that has strong sports offerings for youngsters who have many different sorts of interests and ways of expressing themselves when it comes to their sporting life. For me, that is something best determined at a local level, and I would be very reticent indeed, in looking at the figures you are talking about, about giving you a forthright point of view on particular situations, because each individual case will have a story attached to it. I know the Education Department looks very closely indeed at the sales of the sites you are talking about, and I do not think you can immediately jump to the conclusion that this is necessarily something that will not benefit the youngsters at the school.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q68</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Steve Rotheram:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> If headmasters and headmistresses are best placed to decide locally what is in the best interests of their school in regard to the sale of playing fields, why do you have highly paid advisers in the Department? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Maria Miller:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think you are now straying into the role of the Department for Education.

What I would say very firmly, though, is that when you look at well-performing schools—the excellent schools that we have in this country—the role of sport in the life of those schools will be extremely important. That is something which goes across the board. If you want to know about the role of advisers in the Department for Education, you probably need to direct that question at the Secretary of State for Education. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q69</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Steve Rotheram:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Have you not previously served in that Department? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Maria Miller:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> No. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q70</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Steve Rotheram:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You have not been in the DFE? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Maria Miller:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> No. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q71</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Steve Rotheram:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> But you understand, for instance, that the advisers on school playing fields have, on six occasions, been overruled by the Government in regard to the sale of playing fields? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Maria Miller:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What I can say is that, as the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, I absolutely understand the importance of sport in young persons’ lives and that schools need to have facilities to be able to help youngsters to participate in sport in a great variety of ways. Clearly, the space to be able to do that is important as well. I know from my own experience of visiting schools in many different parts of the country that those facilities can look very different indeed.

Of course we work together, particularly around the Olympic legacy, but if you come to particular issues, like the role of officials, it is quite difficult for me to comment directly.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q73</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Steve Rotheram:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I will come to the Olympic legacy.

I think that you would find that across the board, with almost every single Minister saying the same thing. The recognition of the importance of tourism is clear. In the recent autumn statement from the Chancellor, there was an increase in funding of £30 million for the GREAT campaign, which I am sure you are aware is the main marketing campaign for </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Britain</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. That is important, because it gives us a consistent way to present our country abroad in the whole variety of markets that we are targeting to grow our tourism numbers. We have reason to be investing behind that campaign because we want to see a significant increase in the number of people visiting our shores. So far we have seen more than 1.5 million extra overseas visitors since 2011, which is ahead of the target we set for ourselves. We are seeing not only more people, but more people who spend more, which is significant—it is almost £1 billion of extra visitor spend. While you cannot directly tie it back only to the impact of the GREAT campaign, I think it has given us the opportunity to market ourselves more consistently.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I shall give you a simple example.

However, while I can understand the importance of looking at the phasing of bank holidays and how that can affect destinations such as the one that you represent, I think it is even more important to focus on the importance of a staycation. That is why we have been at pains to protect and continue to invest in the “holidays at home” GREAT campaigns, as well as those that are international in their outlook. We invested £8 million in VisitEngland’s domestic campaigns between 2012 and 2014, which will directly benefit constituencies such as the one that you represent, and throughout the country. We have a fantastic offer in terms of domestic tourism, which is enhanced enormously through our fantastic cultural and heritage offerings.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q85</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Conor Burns:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Another great way to extend the season in Bournemouth without moving the bank holiday would be—I say this on a cross-party basis—for the party conferences to come back to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Bournemouth</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.

We have higher rates of VAT on bed-and-breakfast and hotel accommodation in this country than many comparator and competitor overseas destinations. Have you been in any talks with the Treasury? I know it is a major bugbear for the industry that it is at a comparative competitive disadvantage.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Maria Miller:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I have made it a priority, through VisitEngland and VisitBritain, to talk to the tourism industry. I know that one area that it is particularly keen for the Government always to keep under review and to look at is the various tax regimes to which it is subject, whether that is VAT or air passenger duty. It is right that we continually look at all these things and make sure that we are not putting our tourism market at a disadvantage. I know that there are no plans at the moment to make any changes around VAT, particularly, but I think you are right that there are things that we need to look at. Tourism is not only important now, but growing in its importance. As we market our country even more effectively both at home and abroad, of course we will want to make sure that we are looking at these issues, but given the economic circumstances that we face at the moment, these are not things that we feel can particularly be addressed.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q86</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Conor Burns:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I agree with that.

The figures on that indicate that a third of our tourism visitors would not return during the five-year construction phase and that over 14% would never return, which would completely decimate our tourism.

A great deal of the focus of my Department’s work is around culture and the arts and how we can even better link tourism into culture and art, and also sports, especially our international sports events. Clearly there is a need for us to remain abreast of the sorts of issues that you talk about, although they are probably best dealt with by the people representing those areas. It would be quite difficult to get involved in the impact of particular events in areas.

We know that sport is hugely important in this country, not only for sports fans and people who enjoy watching sport, but on an economic level. Sport is an important part of our economy, too.

What I wanted to do was to get a feeling for how sporting organisations felt this was being addressed. What was clear to me was that, across the board, there is activity undertaken to help people to report untoward, potentially criminally activity. There was also a consensus—indeed there are plans in place—to help to educate sportsmen and women about the unacceptable nature of that sort of activity. The agreements coming out of that meeting, and my overwhelming feeling, was that we needed really to look at the effectiveness of those education programmes and that is what we have agreed to do with the sporting bodies. We also need to look at whether there is potential for an improvement in the reporting mechanisms, and potentially at whether a third-party reporting mechanism might help people to be able to report problems as and when they occur.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q104</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Leech:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Was there any discussion about whether the penalties in different sports for being caught doing spot fixing are severe enough?

I think this is probably one of the areas that I am quite interested in looking at further, because it is important for us to understand those that are most at risk of being caught in this sort of potentially criminal activity. I don’t see at the moment that there is very much other than anecdotal evidence around this. I tend to sympathise with your view that you need to have a penalty that is really going to have an effect. Certainly if you look at someone who is at the beginning of their career, somebody in the middle of their career and somebody who is at the end of their career, the penalties that might be in place could be very different, depending on the individual circumstances in which people find themselves.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I have to pay particular tribute to the work of the National Crime Agency in this respect as it has been incredibly effective at throwing the spotlight on this right from the beginning of its work. Certainly, in the cases that have come through, many of the individuals involved appear to fall into distinct groups and perhaps we just need to spend a bit of time understanding that and making sure that the sporting organisations can understand that the penalties that are in place are effective.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q105</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Leech:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Was there any discussion about whether or not trying to clamp down on gambling on specific events and games was an option that could be explored, and the challenges of doing something like that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Maria Miller:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Obviously it is not in anybody’s interest—not gambling organisations, sports clubs or anybody—for this sort of activity to go on. I think that one thing that is very clear is that there are some very robust procedures in place for identifying trends in terms of these sorts of activities. I think it would be difficult to say at this stage what further action needs to be taken, but certainly what would strike me is that there are some very robust procedures in place to monitor trends. Rather than simply dealing with the problem, I want to try to deal with some of the causes.

That is a very demonstrable way that we are adding to that through our legacy work. But then if you look at the work we are doing through organisations like Sport England and our youth sports plan, we are investing more into sports clubs to enable them to expand and to take up the growing appetite for involvement in sports at a community level.

After all, the most important arts subject of all is English and that is a core subject for young people to study. The role of Shakespeare in the curriculum now is something that this Committee should applaud. Again, going back to my recent visit to Russia, where the studying of Shakespeare is widespread and seen as being one of the best ways to study English literature—or to study literature, full stop.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q130</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Bradshaw:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> But the very clear evidence that we got from the creative industries was that the effect of the Government’s new measuring system on school performance is already squeezing out arts and creative subjects from schools.

That has been something that people have expressed concern about to me. When I go to places such as Manchester and Birmingham—I was recently in Manchester talking to the Hallé orchestra about some of their fundraising—I see the support that organisations like that are receiving now and have received over the years, from corporate sponsors as well as from philanthropic giving. It is considerable. The Catalyst fund, which was launched a couple of years ago, has been immensely successfully. It is a match-funding fund to encourage more philanthropic giving. You are right, however, that there is still more to do in that area. We will always be looking at ways to encourage even more philanthropic giving in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">future.

It states: “Gambling prevalence was highest in the top quintiles of equivalised household income…and lowest among the lowest income households.” That flies in the face of the evidence that other people would like you to believe. The survey continues: “Exceptions to this general pattern were bingo and scratchcards”. They were the only two exceptions. This is in the health survey that was carried out, so it has nothing to do with betting shops or anything like that. People would have you believe the role of betting shops in the local community is that they target the poorest areas and these machines in bookmakers are being gambled on. The evidence in here is quite clear, and I hope you will therefore go away, read this and consider it, because I think it will be quite striking.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Maria Miller:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Obviously, you are right; all the evidence needs to be analysed in full. What I would say, though, is that it is important to understand the impact of problem gambling wherever it falls. I would also say that it would be wrong to discount people’s anecdotal concerns in advance of having that evidence base put together. Of course, I will always listen to people’s concerns, and I know that there are some very real concerns about the impact of machines that may involve potentially very large stakes. The absence of any evidence does not mean to say that there is no harm to be had. What you have just cited is simply one piece of research. It is not necessarily constructed to delve down into the detail of those that may be experiencing problems with gambling, because I believe it is a broad and national survey on very broad health issues.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Philip Davies:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It is quite a detailed survey, actually.

What I want to see now is the BBC implementing the governance changes they have talked about. It is very easy for us all to throw stones at an institution like the BBC. I happen to think that it is an incredible organisation that has the ability to be very powerful indeed in terms of the way people perceive our country around the world. We all need to do everything that we can to ensure that it gets back into the position that we want it to be in, in terms of having the trust of the great British public. My focus is on that. I think that it is a sideline to continually focus on individual people. We need to make sure that the institution itself is robust and strong.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q151</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Philip Davies:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I have two final questions, which only need very simple answers.

We have £3 million spent on the Pollard review, ending in an absolute farce over the fact that the report is clearly flawed by everybody’s own admission. You still have confidence in Lord Patten. Could you just outline to us what it would take for you to lose confidence in Lord Patten as chairman of the BBC Trust?

Lord Patten has also, I think, taken very important steps to ensuring that the flawed and broken governance structure of the BBC is changed, improved and strengthened for the future. What I want to do is to focus on that because, by focusing on positive improvement, we can help the BBC get back to the position we want it to be in. But you can have my absolute assurance that I will be looking </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">carefully at the effectiveness of those governance changes.
