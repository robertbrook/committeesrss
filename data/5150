Therefore, illicit tobacco undermines small retailers such as our members by depriving them of key earnings whilst having a detrimental effect on general footfall as consumers do not enter their shops to buy other groceries. The social cost of the illicit trade is also extensive, with revenue from the sale of illicit tobacco directly funding all manner of criminal activity that could overflow into the local community, where our members’ businesses are located. </span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:115%; margin:6pt 0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">3.4 </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">A report from KPMG</span><a name="_ftnref2"></a><a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt"> in April 2013 showed the UK has the fastest growing problem with illicit tobacco in the entire EU – with contraband and counterfeit production increasing by 6.4% in the last year.
