This includes over £1 million given in grants to community groups throughout the UK, media and public information campaigns that have reached tens of millions of people, and po</span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">licy interventions - like the one on Part P - which have helped ensure that consumers are protected from deregulatory, potentially dangerous, political agendas.

However, the regulations have been in place for just eight years and information on home safety often takes many years to embed in the public consciousness.
