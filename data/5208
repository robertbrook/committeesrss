I am submitting on my own behalf, not on behalf of any particular organization. I am a 29 year old first generation American, born to Irish parents who first met in London, England in 1980. My mother was a nurse and my father was a laborer. The horrible disease we know as CJD took my mom’s life November 28, 2010. Her name was Kathleen (McNulty) Ewing.</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; line-height:12.45pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7.5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">To answer the terms of reference outlined on the Parliament’s website…</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; line-height:12.45pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7.5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">1. Greater precautions should certainly be taken to further reduce risk of potential spread of disease. I witnessed the decline of my mother first hand day in and day out during the last two months of her lives when I was 25 years old. Trust me when I say this is not something you want to see happen to your worst enemy, let alone the person you love most in the world. I do not think the NHS is being overly restrictive. Why take risks?</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; line-height:12.45pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7.5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">2. I do not believe the Government and its scientific advisory structure are responsive to threats posed by emerging diseases. </span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; line-height:12.45pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7.5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">3. The threat of ongoing transmission of vCJD through the blood and blood product supply is questionable. I highly doubt the threat has been adequately mitigated. How did vCJD become a problem in the first place? I know the answer…do you?</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; line-height:12.45pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7.5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">4. No comment on the strengths and weaknesses. </span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; line-height:12.45pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7.5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">5. The UK has a lot to learn from other first world countries. The BSE crisis emerged during Margaret Thatcher’s leadership. During this time, the government knowingly allowed unsafe meat into the food supply, all for the mighty “dollar” (pound). Was it worth it? </span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; line-height:12.45pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7.5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; line-height:12.45pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7.5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic">January 2014</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
