UCO is a waste product which poses a considerable risk to the environment and public health if it is not disposed of properly. Significant amounts of UCO are disposed of down the drain: water companies in the UK spend £15m per annum clearing used cooking oil from their sewers and 75% of the 200,000 drain clearance call-outs every year involve used cooking oil.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Using waste products to produce bioliquids for use in renewable heat and power has none of the potentially damaging environmental impacts traditionally associated with biofuels, such as using displacing food crops from agricultural land and growing biomass as a raw material. CHP stations are also the most energy efficient way to use bioliquids made from </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">UCO. A study by North Energy funded by DECC and managed by the NNFCC showed that “the highest absolute savings in total greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved by using refined vegetable oil derived from used cooking oil in a CHP unit to displace heat generated </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">from fuel oil and electricity from the grid.’’</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Distortion of the bioliquids market</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">At present DECC’s different approach to bioliquid-fuelled CHP in the RHI and the EMR suggest there is a lack of joined-up thinking in the Department on this issue. It suggests bioliquids are to be excluded from the EMR strike price mechanism since there are limited options to decarbonise the transport sector, and so renewable liquid fuel are best diverted into transport rather than into heat and power. However, this reasoning does not appear to apply to the RHI.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">This ignores the fact that bioliquids require complex and costly refining and processing when used as a transport fuel, and that the bioliquids market is large enough to incorporate a wide use of end uses for waste feedstocks such as UCO. It also ignores research which shows that the most sustainable and carbon efficient use of UCO is in CHP stations. Indeed, a study by a number of academics has suggested that it is more efficient to use biomass feedstocks for the generation of electricity to power electric cars than to refine it into biodiesel. With 250,000-300,000 tons of UCO available in the UK, there is scope to use this as a diverse resource for different forms of renewable energy generation. In this point, we agree with the evidence taken by the Committee on 26 March from the Oil-Firing Technical Association.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The solution</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We therefore believe that if the Government is serious about reducing carbon emissions generated by heat production, DECC needs to join up the RHI and the EMR on the point of bioliquids for CHP. There is a clear case for the inclusion of bioliquids within the strike price mechanism of EMR and that DECC should set a strike price along with other technologies which will be included in the first phase of the project from 2017. Living Fuels and others in the industry would be happy to consult with DECC about the optimum level for of support in both the RHI and the EMR, to ensure that there remains sufficient capacity within the UCO market to encourage both the decarbonisation of the transport sector as well as encouraging take up of small onsite and community CHP stations.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Background to Living Fuels</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Living Fuels is a British subsidiary of the £73m AIM-listed renewable energy company Renewable Energy Generation Bio-Power.
