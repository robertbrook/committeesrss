Good afternoon and thank you for the written evidence that we have had, which is interesting. One of the problems that I have in trying to get to the heart of this issue is the terminology in the field of unemployment, which to an outsider can be somewhat ambiguous. What do you think is meant by youth unemployment as opposed to worklessness and the other category of NEET that is increasingly used throughout the whole of Europe as well as the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">? For example, if a young person has left school with no job and is then put by a government programme on to a short-term training scheme, where do they crop up in these figures? What are the real figures and how do we get a better understanding about the real unemployed?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Maguire</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: You have picked up on a very key issue. If we are famous for anything in </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Britain</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">, we are famous for defining the term NEET. We created the term and it was created in the late 1990s following concern about the growing number of young people whose destination was unknown. Prior to 1988, all young people in </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> were eligible for income support or unemployment benefit when they left school. That was terminated in 1988, so 16 to 18</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">year-olds were no longer classified as unemployed. The only group of young unemployed that we had were the post-18 group and they were young people who were claiming benefit and actively seeking work. We had this group of young people who were operating under the radar and who had no official connection to any agency. Towards the end of the 1990s there was growing concern about this unknown group and who they were and, more critically, how many there were. Their official status was zero in the unemployment camp because they were not classified as unemployed. So we coined the term NEET</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">—</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">not in education, employment or training</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">—</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">to get a handle on this population of under-18s who were not participating in education, employment or training. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The distinction is very much, in my mind, that the under-18s were NEET and the over-18s were those who could claim benefit and were actively seeking work. Those two definitions have become rather blurred and the NEET definition is used now more widely to incorporate both young people who are actively seeking work, the unemployed, and the non-active group, the NEET group. Within that NEET group, we now have over a million young people in </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">. </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">W</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">e have these strange definitions and terms, but if we want a classification of just unemployed, they are the young people who are actively seeking work and are claiming benefit. The NEET group are far more difficult to quantify in number and purpose.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Just for clarification, the NEET group, as you now describe them, do not get benefit.

Maybe I should mention this definition of worklessness or joblessness. This is an interesting one and is even more recent than the NEET classification. Worklessness is an EU-wide definition</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> and within the literature you will see a flipping between worklessness and joblessness</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">but </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">it actually means the same thing. The definition here is individuals who are working less than 16 hours a week, so these individuals are still employed albeit working part-time or below 16 hours a week. The definition of worklessness or jobless households, for example, very much features in Europe 2020, the EU’s new reform strategy and successor to the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Lisbon</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> agenda, which attempts to define poverty as individuals living in jobless households and is supposed to pick up on issues of economic inactivity. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The problem with the definition is twofold. One is that individuals are still working, albeit for 16 hours or less a week, and the second is that the definition itself picks up all economically inactive people, such as those on disability benefits and pensioners. There is a real problem with using a worklessness or joblessness definition to look at the youth unemployment problem.

I think it is important to note that youth unemployment is not a recent problem or </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">a </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">recent phenomenon. Back in 1994 the European Commission noted that youth unemployment across the EU stood at 20%, so that is quite high. Of course, in the early 1990s we had the recession</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">, b</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">ut when you compare the EU to its then main competitors in the early 1990s, the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">USA</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> and </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Japan</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">, </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> has had a long-term youth unemployment problem. If we take the current situation in the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> where youth unemployment is at approximately 20%, and we look back at the 20-year period, we will see that 10 years prior to 2008 it was still at 10%, so it is still considerably higher than the then level of general unemployment. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Why exactly is this the case? I am of the persuasion that that 10%, that kind of drag on unemployment, is a complex problem. It is for numerous variables to explain this situation, so it is not just a case of individuals with poor training skills. There may also be some social issues involved in that problem. </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The reasons are </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">clearly not the same as </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">in </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">some other European countries. Our current level of youth unemployment, although it has increased, has not increased as much as other European countries. Our long-term rate of youth unemployment has not been as high as some European countries. When we look across the EU, we see that long term it is the Mediterranean countries that have had a problem here, and we include </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">France</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> within the discussion. These Mediterranean countries have had much higher levels of youth unemployment than the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> and this is because they have often operated dual labour markets, so younger generations find themselves on contracts that are less generous than older generations. It is much easier to dismiss a young person off these contracts</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> so younger generations get made redundant much more easily. They have this dual labour market system. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">We started from a situation before the crisis where youth unemployment was high already</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> and it has increased since 2008, but we think of the problem countries as being those in the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Mediterranean</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> because of the downturn. The problem in the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> is similar in the sense that youth unemployment has sky rocketed because there </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">is </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">a lack of jobs. We can talk all day about skills, and skills are fundamentally important, but if you train and retrain the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">’s young and there is no job waiting for them at the end</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">, </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">this is just a waste of money. If you look at northern European countries since 2008, the economies of the Scandinavian countries, </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Germany</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> and </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Austria</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> have boomed and their youth unemployment has fallen. I think that serves as a good indicator of the real problem. We have an issue of skills but we have an issue of a lack of jobs</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> so you have to take a much broader and more holistic perspective on the problem.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Is there not a mismatch?

I have very first-hand experience of graduates trying to get a job within the sector that I am employed in and I can tell you they face much more difficulty now than they did five years ago. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">In any kind of analysis of youth unemployment, we can look at the statistics but we also need qualitative accounts of individual experiences, and there is a north-south divide.

Spend a day in </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Manchester</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> or Sheffield and you will soon see that the disparities are huge and that if you are a young person in those cities you face much more difficulty than you do in somewhere like </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Sloman</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: Can I add something on that?

Sue was talking about the 1980s, but if we look at the 1990s as well we will see that the trends in statistics show some kind of hangover of youth unemployment that lasts for about eight to 10 years, so it can take a good decade for this to actually come down. </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">T</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">he interesting thing about earlier peaks in youth unemployment and the current situation is that then we did not have welfare to work, which we do now, which I think has been successful in some respects in getting some individuals back into the labour market. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The problem I have when looking at youth unemployment and this idea that it will take about eight to 10 years for youth unemployment to come back down to its pre-recession level is the social consequences of that. We know that when individuals are outside the labour market for a long period, whether they be youth unemployed or general unemployed, they often need much more than something like A</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">4e</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> to get them back into work. There was discussion in the media last week that they could develop physical or mental health issues that cannot be tackled in the more conventional sense and they often require more social intervention. Thinking about this long term, we need to broaden the way that we look at getting people back into work. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Baroness Hooper:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> May I pick up a point made by Professor Sloman when he said that we have far too many schemes? We are looking at EU action to tackle unemployment and we are talking about far too many schemes in the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">. If you look around the European Union as a whole, how many does that add up to and how are we finding out what is best practice in relation to what is going on in other countries?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Sloman</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: As I understand the European youth guarantee and what they call the youth employment initiative, it is meant to be an umbrella commitment with local interpretation. </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">T</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">hat is probably the correct approach there, given the multitude of schemes that exist. As you can see, I am much more of a commentator than an academic, coming from a practitioner background.

It was direct to employers. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The answer, of course, is </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">that </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">employers can do an enormous amount. People learn their skills at work. Commu</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">nication and team-</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">building skills are learnt at work and people learn their skills through having a decent developmental manager who will point out what is going wrong, assist them and spend a bit of time with them. That sort of thing is resource intensive and any particular training scheme is also resource intensive. The problem we have as far as the employer is concerned is tha</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">t skills development is a third-</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">order decision. The first-</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">order decision is what business are you in, so </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">the question is </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">how you compete, how you </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">deliver the service. The second-</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">order decision is how you organise the work, how the work </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">should </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">be </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">organised.

Once you decide how you are going to compete, it is the work organisation</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> and skills come third. It takes an enormous amount of energy and effort to think outside that model and it takes resources. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Lord Wilson talked about my cocktail. The first element in my cocktail would be a change in the Companies Act legislation to ensure that employers meet the social obligation for the development of our workforce in future. That is very controversial, but I do not think we will find a solution within our existing framework while the level of overall demand, and in particular the structural demand as it affects young people, is at the level it is. We will continue to live with a 20% unemployment rate and run the risk of some social disruption. So I think employers need to be fundamentally obliged to do it. That is not popular but that is what I think.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> I think a lot of good employers have a very highly developed sense of social responsibility and outreach </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">in</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> the areas </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">from</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> which they operate.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Sloman</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: Yes, they have. </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">That is a</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">bsolutely right.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Again it could be the sharing of best practice and more publicity being given to people like that.
