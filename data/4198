In addition the increase in sales of bin liners and other secondary uses of so called single use plastic carriers that are displaced e.g. bags for pet faeces etc. needs to be taken into account as well. We therefore recommend that the findings of the behavioural and research findings carried out in Wales and Scotland be factored in the environmental impact study as well as the true impacts once displaced uses are factored in as above.
