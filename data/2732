Introduction </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">1.1 The National Housing Federation is the voice of affordable housing in England. We believe that everyone should have the home they need at a price they can afford. That’s why we represent the work of housing associations and campaign for better housing. Our members provide two and a half million homes for more than five million people. Each year they invest in a diverse range of neighbourhood projects that help create strong, vibrant communities.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">1.2 Housing associations have led the way in delivering quality new homes that meet high standards across the board, such as developing to at least Level 3 of the Code for Sustainable Homes. As social businesses with a long-term commitment to the communities they serve, they are will continue to do this. They are therefore uniquely placed to comment on housing standards as developers and landlords. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">2. The Standards Framework</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">2.1 The Government is right to identify an urgent need to rationalise the standards framework which has grown increasingly bureaucratic and complex in relation to the provision of new affordable housing. In addition to building regulations, separate and overlapping standards apply not only to local planning policies but also as a product of funding requirements through the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA). </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">2.2. This means that housing associations had to meet a myriad of differing and overlapping standards in different geographic areas. It also means that the homes they provide are constantly at a variance with their private developing partners. Not only does this counter the fact that the need for good quality standards is universal, it complicates the supply chain and is a barrier to standardisation that could aid delivery. From an environmental perspective, the right </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">universal standards would ensure that private sector developments were playing their role in reducing carbon emissions and easing fuel bills, as well as helping the Government meet its carbon reduction targets.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">2.3 The current framework also does not reflect the housing landscape where capital investment for affordable housing is severely constrained, with housing associations contributing £6 for every £1 of public investment. This means that the minimal grant per unit only partially subsidises a slightly discounted rent rather than providing for any enhanced standards. Differing standards make it even harder for housing associations to compete for land and do not recognise the consistent need for quality in a climate where homes are much more likely to move flexibly between tenures. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">2.4 The Federation has consistently argued for an approach to standards which is outcome focused and which encourages innovative and site appropriate solutions. We believe that this approach will lead to approaches that are proportionate and balanced to maximise the development of new affordable homes to meet the housing needs on a range of different sites. At present, homes built under the Affordable Housing Programme (AHP) with government investment are built to higher standards than market housing. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">We would like to see all housing built to the same standards. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">2.5 The Federation therefore feels it is imperative to see good quality standards embedded nationally and applied on a cross-tenure basis. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">We believe that the different standards governing social and private housing is a symptom of short-term thinking that is not compatible with sustainability. All new housing development (however funded) should be designed to have a lifespan of at least 60 years, even though experience shows that much housing lasts for well over 100 years. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Therefore, because it is impossible to predict the characteristic needs and wants of households over this period of time, standards should be set that enable homes to continue to fulfil the changing needs of their occupants</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">3. Housing Standards Review</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">3.1 The Federation has been actively involved in both the Harman Review of standards and the Housing Standards Review. There was widespread industry consensus during both reviews of the need for, and the potential to, rationalise standards. This consultation provides the opportunity to achieve this because industry is largely in agreement on the broad principles.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">3.2 We broadly welcome the resulting proposals to rationalise standards, reduce proliferation and aid compliance. We agree that the current system is often complex and overlapping with many standards carrying separate and multiple compliance regimes. This complicates delivery, adding time and cost, and is a barrier to standardisation.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">3.3 This review is timely because we can now assess how these standards are working in practice. For example, housing associations now have sufficient experience of how Code for Sustainable Homes (the Code) homes are performing and the true value and costs of such standards are better understood. It is also an opportunity to review how design decisions have been distorted by overlapping and/or conflicting standards and to identify any unintended consequences. This is an essential step to determining what should be in any ‘national’ set, or ultimate building regulations.</span><br /><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">3.4 We firmly support the principle, outlined in the consultation, that any standards emerging from the review should be capable of application to both affordable and private housing on an equal basis. The need for quality standards is universal, not specific to tenure, and there is little evidence to support a blanket application of separate standards based on resident needs or preferences, particularly as the home is likely to move between tenures over the course of its life. No additional standards should be required for affordable housing as a condition of public funding. Any restrictions would belie the funding environment, make it harder for housing associations to compete for land and, fundamentally, would not recognise the consistent need for quality and flexible tenure.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">3.5 Since these standards concern the technical design and construction of new homes, we believe they should ultimately be integrated into, and enforced by, building regulations. We recognise that, due to the time this may take, nationally described standards set as a stepping stone en route to integrating standards into building regulations offers the best approach. There should be a clear and robust roadmap for how and when this will take place, giving the industry proper time to prepare. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">3.6 We firmly support the intention in the review to curtail the proliferation of local standards and a policy statement limiting the use of discretionary standards to those proposed </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">pffers</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> a sensible approach. If the benefits of standardisation and delivery are to be realised across the affordable and private sectors, this policy statement should encourage cross-tenure application and preclude different levels for affordable and private housing unless based on robust evidence.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">3.7 We believe that, where possible, standards should be set using performance or functional requirements to allow flexibility in how to comply. We believe the principles set out in the Allowable Solutions consultation provide a good model of how this could be taken forward. Such performance requirements would encourage good design, ingenuity and innovation, as well as appropriate product standards. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">3.8 To embed good quality design, we believe that the Level 1 standards should be mandated baselines rather voluntary regulated options. We believe that, as outlined by the consultation and demonstrated by the Impact Assessment, the cost implications of doing this can be met by the industry.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">4. Code for Sustainable Homes </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 3.2pt 0pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">4.1 Housing associations have a significant track record in building good quality affordable housing and meeting, and in many cases exceeding, Level 3 of the Code for Sustainable Homes when building housing for social rent or low cost home ownership under the </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Affordable Housing Programme (</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">AHP). In London housing associations have been building to Code Level 4 as part of the Mayor’s Housing Design Standards. Therefore our views of the Code are based on the experiences of our members in delivering the Code for Sustainable Homes. </span><br /><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">4.2 We have argued that the Code operates inflexibly, particularly with its ‘mandatory requirements’ that, for some developments, are not practical or cannot always be achieved without disproportionate additional costs being incurred. One very clear example is the surface water requirement (SUR1) that has been problematic in certain areas due to underlying geology. While the proposed changes to this requirement are an improvement, they do not fully address how to ensure that we maximise the amount of affordable housing that can be built in these areas. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">4.3 Similarly we have argued that the Code should be changed to ensure that high standards of fabric energy efficiency are encouraged and rewarded. This would achieve long-term emissions savings from the outset rather than relying too much on the installation of high specification technologies. Housing associations have reported that some of these technologies have been expensive to maintain, adding to the pressure of constrained asset management budgets. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">4.4 The Code is currently designed as a prescriptive ‘one-size fits all’ approach that is not appropriate for the full range of new housing developments. The inflexible design and operation of the Code penalises developments in rural areas (often on small ‘exception sites’), small housing schemes generally (</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">brownfield</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> in-fill sites) and urban schemes with blocks of flats to the detriment of meeting housing need in these areas. Therefore the economics of what can be achieved under the Code are dependent on both the location and the scale of development but this is not recognised in how the Code currently operates. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">5. Conclusion</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">5.1 The Code was intended to pioneer higher standards of sustainability and housing associations have taken the lead in delivering this. They are committed to developing sustainable and affordable homes and are reviewing their experience with completed and occupied schemes developed under the Code. As a result of this process they have </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">identified those aspects of the Code that work and so can be repeated and, more importantly, those aspects that have not worked so that they are not used again. We believe that only those aspects of the Code that have worked should be considered for inclusion in national standards under the Housing Standards Review.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">5.2 Therefore we support the winding down of the Code, provided appropriate transitional measures are put in place. We believe that, depending on the outcome of the consultation, the broad direction </span><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">of travel contained in the Housing Standards Review is a significant and positive step forward in creating a housing industry that delivers both good quality homes, and at the scale we need to alleviate the housing crisis. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">7</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic"> October 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
