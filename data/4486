In many countries, parents of girls with disabilities can apply for court orders to allow the involuntarily sterilization of </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">their child with disability, even if she is legally an adult. The laws treat people with d</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">isabilities differently, and courts have the power to make decisions for them that have life-altering effects on their future.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="color:#32190b; font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt; text-decoration:underline">DFID and the rights of people with disabilities </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="12" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 35.66pt; padding-left:0.34pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">DFID’s new focus on disability is very welcome. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">DFID Ministers are to be commended for stating so clearly and publicly that they will</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">“put disability at the forefront of the world’s development efforts” and for their acknowledgement that we “will never so</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">lve the root causes of poverty unless we end the discrimination and prejudice that disabled people face every day”. DFID has also indicated that future DFID projects in areas like education will ensure access for people with disabilities.  The challenge an</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">d the opportunity for DFID is to translate this strong rhetorical commitment into practical action. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="13" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 35.66pt; padding-left:0.34pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">There are a number of specific steps that DFID should take. First, it should agree a comprehensive new strategy on disability and development, including b</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">y designating disability as a cross-cutting issue, similar to gender. Second, through this strategy and DFID country strategies, it should set clear goals and targets around enhancing the rights of disabled people, in terms of access to health, education, </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">nutrition and livelihoods, but also reforms to legal and informal practices that discriminate against people with disabilities. It is striking that many of DFID’s 5-year country strategies make no reference to disability and set no targets for improving th</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">e conditions of people with disabilities. Thirdly, DFID should disaggregate data, so that it is possible to assess the impact of its programmes on people with disabilities and other vulnerable social groups. Fourth, DFID could usefully designate a senior o</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">fficial within the Department as the lead on disability issues.  Fifthly, DFID should deepen its engagement with disabled persons organisations and human rights organisations working on disability rights, to draw on their expertise and networks when design</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">ing and implementing their development programmes.  </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="14" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 35.66pt; padding-left:0.34pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">UK government should also press the issue of disability rights through key international organisations like the World Bank and other international financial institutions. The World Bank’s ongoing safeguards review provides an important opportunity to do so</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">. The UK government should support policy reforms to require the World Bank to respect international human rights law in all of its activities. This should include respecting the rights of persons with disabilities and working to make sure that all activit</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">ies are disability-inclusive. More broadly, an essential element of such a human rights requirement would be ensuring that the World Bank does not discriminate against people on any grounds prohibited by international law and that it works to address inequ</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">ality in its activities. To operationalize this human rights requirement, the World Bank should undertake due diligence to identify the human rights impacts of its activities, avoid or mitigate adverse impacts, and confirm that the rights of persons with d</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">isabilities are fully respected. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">15. The UK government should also ensure that its own domestic laws are in compliance with the CRPD and all other human rights laws ratified by the UK relevant to persons with disabilities. This includes, in particular, l</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">aws governing legal capacity.
