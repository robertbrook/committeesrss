While competitive dialogue is appropriate for more complex contracts, it can be a highly complex process.  Some service providers welcome it, while others find it too slow and expensive.  In fact, the Government has discouraged the use of the competitive dialogue procedure in central government with certain exceptions.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial;

font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">To address these concerns, more attempts are underway to develop outcome-focused specifications that are less prescriptive about the inputs and outputs and focus instead on the impact of their service.  However desirable the theory may be, there are few practical examples.  In part, this is due to the difficulties in measuring outcomes sufficiently to be able </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">to assess</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> whether they are being achieved</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">.  Often, the measures chosen are 'proxy' measures or output measures which can prove difficult to price.  There are several procurement exercises underway at the time of writing that have attempted to embed an outcomes-bases specification.  Southampton's contract with Balfour Beatty has alread</span><span style="font-family:Arial;

This diversity, while reflecting different strands of public service delivery, can make it harder for public service professionals to collaborate on commissioning.  Whereas there are generic standards for programme and project management through the Office of Government Commerce’s ‘PRINCE2’ and ‘Managing Successful Programmes’ (MSP), there are not yet equivalent standards for commissioning.  </span><span style="font-family:Arial;
