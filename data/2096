The Duty Scheme operates daily and appellants are assisted by ASAP staff and around 30 volunteer solicitors and barristers. In 2012 we represented in 455 cases, just over half the number of appellants with oral hearings.  ASAP also provides training on asylum support law to voluntary sector agencies and runs a telephone advice line. We seek to influence asylum support policy through research, lobbying and strategic litigation.  </span></p><p style="margin:12pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';

The current position of the Home Office, inserted in their Guidance and now in the draft Bill, has, we believe, emerged out of practice.   These asylum seekers have usually applied for section 95 support, been refused and appeal.  When we represent them at the Tribunal we have experience of the judges awarding section 95, section 4(2) and section 4(1).  Even though the Guidance now makes clear they are eligible under section 4(1</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">)(</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">a), it is still a grey area as to when they should be transferred to section 95 support. Even though the Deregulation Bill will amend the IAA such that this group will be eligible for section 4(2), there are still likely to be support applications which are refused by the Home Office on the basis they do not quite ‘fit’ and hence the need for a residual power.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';
