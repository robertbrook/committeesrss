We live in an epoch of constitution-making. A recent survey of the world’s constitutions suggested that approximately 25% of the world’s constitutions have been drafted and adopted since 1974. Such is the universal status of human rights discourse, that it is virtually unthinkable </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">that the promulgation of a new constitution in the twenty-first century would not contain, as one of its component elements, a statement somewhere of the rights of the people and refer directly or impliedly to human rights standards prevailing in the international community. Events such as the collapse of former communist-bloc countries in Eastern Europe, demilitarised states in Greece Portugal and Spain in western Europe (and elsewhere) and the post-colonial/apartheid emergence of states in Africa and elsewhere have generated new constitutional settlements that have featured at their respective cores bills of rights, guaranteeing a varying degree of rights and freedoms. Moreover (and unlike the constitutional documents that Jefferson was familiar with) a modern constitution would be expected to state with some degree of precision the remedies available to an injured party and the procedures by which these remedies might be enforced.  </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">3. The survey conducted by Elkins et al of the constitutional features of 186 national constitutions reveals an interesting correlation.</span><a name="_ftnref2"></a><a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt"> From a total of 117 different rights enshrined in these constitutions, the newer constitutions were more likely to contain a higher total of rights than their more venerable counterparts. Thus the Constitutions of Angola (2010); Bolivia (2009) and Ecuador (2008) set out respectively express protection for 79, 88 &amp; 86 different rights, whilst the Constitutions of United States (1789); Norway (1814) and Belgium (1831) by contrast manage reference to 35, 14 and 34 different rights. This pattern might be explained by the expansion of the ‘human rights catalogue’ from an initial (typically Western) position in which a limited set of negative civil/political rights against the state are conceded (requiring in the main no positive actions or commitment of resources by the state) to a much broader set of socio-economic rights claims such as rights to healthcare, education, housing (requiring state actions and economic resources and so-called third generation rights to the protection of the environment and cultural aspects of community life.  (A counter example of a modern constitution containing a relatively modest total of individual rights is provided by Myanmar (2008) with protection for just 38 different rights).</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">4. Interestingly, even within ‘Westminster-style’ constitutions that draw heavily upon notions of responsible government and parliamentary supremacy, ‘bills of rights’ have nonetheless become more prominent in New Zealand, the UK, the Australian state of Victoria and Australian Capital Territory and signal new relationships not only between the individual and the state but also inter-institutionally between the executive, legislature and judiciary. Canada’s departure from the Westminster model in 1982 is worth highlighting.</span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">The Constitution Act of that year signalled the end of the UK Parliament’s powers to legislate for Canada and included the Canadian Charter of Rights that  formally authorised judicial review of primary legislation enacted by federal and state </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">legislatures, albeit with an express power of legislative override in s.33 of the Charter in respect of judicial rulings on ‘fundamental’ rights (s.2) and ‘legal’ and ‘equality’ rights (ss.7-15).</span><a name="_ftnref3"></a><a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">5. In seeking to draw instructive lessons from the experiences of other countries, it is right however to remember that the structure and content of national constitutions will inevitably reflect an interactive set of historical, economic, political and cultural influences that are unique to that state.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">6.   1</span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">.

Outside of EU law (see below), the judges do not enjoy a power to ‘strike-down’, ‘disapply’ or invalidate an Act of Parliament. The law is what the latest Act of Parliament says it is. In respect of human rights protected under Section 1 of the Human Rights Act 1998, the Act is generally considered to allow judges greater leeway to strain parliamentary language to secure a European Convention-compatible reading of a domestic statute than would be permitted under the usual canons of statutory interpretation. The 1998 Act does not allow the courts to disapply a domestic statute where a Convention-compatible reading is not possible. In this sense parliamentary supremacy is preserved. A non-binding declaration of incompatibility may be issued by the court in such cases. However, this does not affect the outcome of the case. Instead, such a declaration may serve as a prompt to the political part of the Constitution - Parliament and the Executive - to consider arguments for reform of the rights-infringing statute. The combined effect of ss.3 &amp; 4 of the 1998 Act is commonly said to have generated a ‘dialogic’ approach to human rights protection in which the judges participate in a ‘conversation’ with the elected spheres of the Constitution about the extent of citizens’ human rights protections. Ultimately, the dominant position of the Executive within the UK Legislature means that the Government has the final say.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">As regards EU law, the decision of the House of Lords in </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">ex parte Factortame </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">No2</span><a name="_ftnref4"></a><a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt"> revealed that the UK Parliament is no longer sovereign in respect of matters governed by EU law.

It is possible to conceive of a form of constitutional codification in which the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty is affirmed and the judges’ role is not expanded to encompass judicial review of all primary legislation. In this scenario, some version of ‘dialogic’ rights protection continues. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">8.

That is to say, a later Parliament wishing to repeal the provisions of a constitutional statute must do so in express terms in the later, amending legislation.

As the debates around the time of the Brighton Declaration in April 2012 show, the UK Government (or at least the Conservative component of the Government) and a significant section of parliamentary opinion has been concerned that European Court of Human Rights rulings on UK authorities’ rulings on prisoners’ voting rights (such as </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Hirst</span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt"> No2) and deportation of foreign terrorist suspects (eg </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Abu Qatada</span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">) represent an unduly interventionist approach that limits the ability of UK authorities to act in ways that the latter consider reflect public opinion and/or safeguard national security. This explains both (i) the push by the UK to secure greater recognition of the principle of subsidiarity in the Strasbourg Court’s rulings; and (ii) the desire in some quarters for a new British Bill of Rights that would strike a different balance between individual rights and competing interests such as public safety and national security. In those instances where the Strasbourg Court applies a lighter touch form of supra-national rights review, this may go some way to meet some of  the Court’s critics here in the UK.

What proportion of post-enactment challenges would be headed off by a system of pre-enactment scrutiny is not knowable. The Scottish experience is relevant here. Since the Scotland Act 1998 came into force, there is no single reported instance of a referral to the Supreme Court. It may be speculated that the distinction between reserved and non-reserved matters has been expressed with such clarity in the 1998 Act that there is little scope for disagreement on what is within/outside the competence of the Scottish Parliament. As to what might happen in the UK under a codified constitution, much would hinge on the design of any pre-enactment clause. For example who would have the power of referral? Would it be confined to Law Officers or might Members of Parliament and/or Select Committees be able to refer matters (in Germany one third of MPs may request an advisory/pre-enactment review)? If not, might MPs/HL members be able to seek judicial review in respect of a decision of a senior Law Officer not to refer? What about persons outside Parliament/Executive?

Pre-enactment scrutiny has obvious similarities with the concept of an advisory opinion that is known in some jurisdictions such as Canada, Germany and England (in the guise of a declaration).It has been constitutionally prohibited in the United States on separation of powers grounds since Chief Justice John Jay refused to give President Washington the benefit of the Supreme Court’s opinion on the constitutionality of American neutrality in the war between Great Britain and France in the 1790s. In the UK, the remedy known as a ‘declaration’ can be used to obtain authoritative judicial guidance in the absence of any actual legal dispute.

In New Zealand, the Labor Govt proposed an entrenched Bill of Rights in 1985 largely on the basis that the dominant position of the governing party in a unicameral legislature might risk the gradual erosion of individual liberties. However in the consultation exercise which followed, the vast majority of consultees expressed concern at the transfer of powers away from politicians and towards the judges. The Canadian version of rights review by the courts was deemed to give the judges too much power.  A statutory Bill of Rights followed in 1990 (NZBORA) which is not entrenched and is liable to be modified by subsequent Acts of the NZ Parliament under both express and implied repeal. NZBORA does not even suffice to impliedly repeal pre-1990 NZBORA-inconsistent legislation. The main rights-protecting achievement of NZBORA is that </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">whenever a statute can be given a meaning that NZBORA consistent, the judges must prefer this meaning to a rival, NZBORA-inconsistent meaning.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">October 2013</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div><hr style="width:33%; height:1px; text-align:left" /><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn1"></a><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:10pt">Jefferson made this claim on learning that the draft Constitution emerging from the Philadelphia Convention had omitted any reference to a set of express guarantees for individual freedoms against the federal government.
