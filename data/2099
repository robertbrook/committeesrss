This is actually an unhelpful proposal, both to business and to the Employment Tribunal service. There is no evidence to suggest that Employment Tribunals have used this power to make recommendations to place onerous burdens on businesses. Although there may be a 'fear' on the part of certain businesses that this may be the consequence of such a power, they cannot provide such evidence. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 35pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="3" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The circumstances where a tribunal might operate this power would be where, for example, a policy of an employer had a wide scope to generate discriminatory impacts on a number of employees (or others). So, the intended impact of the use of this power would be to lessen the risk of repeat offences, but impacting on other employees than the claimant. In those circumstances it would be in the interests of the business to make such changes, to reduce the risk of further litigation. It would also be in the broader interests of the Employment Tribunal service (and the Government) to lessen the case load on them.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 35pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="4" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">PCS cannot therefore see any good reason to pursue the amendment to the Equality Act. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 35pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chapter A1 Apprenticeships England</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="5" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The TUC rightly supported the Richard Review of Apprenticeships which sought to restore proper training, work placement, qualifications and status to apprenticeships.
