Several months later they said that they no longer wished to do that, and that they wanted to wait until the full functionality was available before we did releases to them. At the time, it was true.

The BBC had already had fault and you entered into no-fault. It was seriously at risk in 2009. The BBC then pushed on, telling us on this Committee in February 2011, “Don’t worry, it’s going to be implemented by the summer”, and the following month knew that it wasn’t going to miss a key objective in the benefits case.

I don’t know how you would come to Barking and Dagenham—I always say Barking and Dagenham, but it is the area I am closest to—and how on earth you would explain to the people there that somebody working at the BBC who is made redundant then feels it is right to take nearly £700,000 and a nearly £2 million pension pot.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Caroline Thomson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I do absolutely understand that point, and I have been on a number of platforms where people have asked me that question since.

I am afraid that I am going to start with you again, Mark Thompson. You gave evidence to us on this issue in February 2011. I am going to read what you said in answer to me at question 95: “</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What is happening at the moment is that DMI is out in the business. There are many programmes that are already being made with DMI, and some have gone to air and are going to air with DMI already working. It is true that some modules are slightly later in delivery than we initially planned, but other modules have been brought forward, though. Crucially, is it on track now to fully deliver over the course of this year for BBC North and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Salford</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">? Yes, it is. Are there going to be any significant further delays in benefit from the way we a</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">re delivering it? No, there won’t be…</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We have got a more flexible way of delivering, but it is out in the business. The modules which are out there are working and are making programmes, and what is exciting about DMI is that the feedback from users of the system is very positive. I think you are going to see a broader deployment of the system across the BBC than we expected, because of the enthusiasm with which it is being used.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">” That appears to have misled us, again.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mark Thompson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I don’t believe that I have misled you on any other matter, and I do not believe that I knowingly misled you on this one.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I will answer your question directly, but can I just make one broad point about DMI before then? In my time at the BBC, we had very many successful technology projects—very large projects, some of them much larger than DMI. I believe that the team, including John Linwood, who </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">were</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in the middle of DMI had many successes—for example, digital switchover, West One, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Salford</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and BBC </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">iPlayer</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. I just wanted to say—and I have heard what John has had to say—that I have not seen in detail the evidence on the basis of which DMI was cancelled, but, notwithstanding John’s view, everything I have heard and seen makes me feel that DMI was not a success. It failed as a project. It failed in a way that also meant the loss of a lot of public money. As the director-general who was at the helm when DMI was created and developed and who, in the end, oversaw much of the governance system that, as we will no doubt discuss, did not perform perfectly in this project, I just want to say sorry. I want to apologise to you and to the public for the failure of this project. That is the broad point.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Thank you.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mark Thompson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Here we are in the beginning of 2014—I am not going to debate with you whether or not this project failed.

Why did I believe that?

I have gone back and asked the BBC to look at all the briefing materials—I had a voluminous amount of briefing from the BBC—and there is a real consistency between the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">briefing</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I got—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Bacon:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Sorry, a real inconsistency?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mark Thompson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> No, a real consistency between the briefing I got and the evidence that I gave.

But you told us “It is out there—there are many programmes coming out.” </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">So either you misled us, or you were misled.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Something was wrong.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mark Thompson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Let me give you just a sense of my briefing. To be honest, there were echoes of this in John Linwood’s testimony a few minutes ago, and Mr Bacon has helped me to understand this by putting his finger on the use of one word in particular, which is “deployment”.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">This is the timeline I am given; I am giving you evidence from February 2011, and this is part of the timeline I am shown. “28 June 2010. Release 2, Fabric Workplace”—this is one release inside DMI—“was successfully deployed and was made available to production staff in London Factual. Fabric Workplace gives these teams the ability to ingest their rushes from standard and HD tape into the Fabric Workspace, organise content into projects and manage the work groups across these projects, view and organise their rushes from their desktop in the office as well as at home by connecting to Fabric across the internet, share content”—it enables them to share content with other members of the team—“store their rushes, send to Final Cut Pro and Avid for craft editing.” London Factual is the biggest programme-making department in BBC television.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The day before I gave evidence, we got another note: “Our next release, Enhanced Production Tools, entered into user acceptance testing this week. This release builds on the production tool we previously delivered in 2010, F</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">abric </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Works</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">pace</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, and desktop editing and logging. We will deploy its release to pilot users in Bristol, the ‘Blue Peter’ production team, ‘The One Show’ current affairs team, ‘Bang Goes the Theory’”—again—“‘Generation Earth’, weather and ‘</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Pavlopetri</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’ inside London Factual.”</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">So two things: I have seen at least one actual example. I know that at least an early prototype version was used on “Frozen Planet”. I am told it has been—in quotes—“successfully” deployed and made available inside the biggest production department in the BBC. I also took some comfort, and this is not in any way meant as criticism, from reading both the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Amtec</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and NAO reports—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Amtec</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> were commissioned by the NAO to come in and look at the project. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Amtec</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> said “The project has demonstrated in its early releases that the technology fundamentally works, is feasible and can gain user acceptance. The remaining areas of technological risk are being addressed through improved planning and management processes.”</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Now, I think we know—and it is not a criticism of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Amtec</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, because that was also the belief of the BBC as a whole, that that was happening—that almost certainly there were, even at this stage, some issues which over the course of the coming weeks and months would become significant. But that was what </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Amtec</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> said, and the NAO, again understandably, said </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">“The Digital Media Initiative is a challenging Programme, but the BBC has now started to deliver the system and users have been positive about the elements delivered.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">”</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">External technical advisers; some personal experiences I had; the flavour, which, in retrospect, is very bullish—Mr Bacon is right about the very bullish use of the world “deployed”, meaning, perhaps, elements that have been loaded on to a desktop but not really extensively used: that was the background to the remarks I made to you in February 2011. I am absolutely clear that at the time that was what I knew and believed about the project.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q98</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So you were misled?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mark Thompson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Well, I think you heard a flavour of it earlier today. One of the issues of which I was not aware in February 2011, and of which I only really became aware in 2012, is that, in a sense, these were complicated, difficult issues. There was a pronounced and, it would appear, growing difference of opinion between the team making DMI and the business users on how effective and how real the technology was. You will understand that I have been involved in a lot of projects at the BBC and in other organisations, and I can smell business obstinacy. I can </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">smell when a business is unready, is not prepared to play ball or is constantly moving the goalposts.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I absolutely understand John Linwood’s particular perspective, given what he was doing. He was a very passionate advocate of the project, and I understand all of that. In my time, which ended when I left in September 2012, I saw great efforts being made by the business—in other words, by colleagues inside BBC Vision, BBC North and elsewhere—to get DMI to work. Although there were tensions, I do not believe that those tensions, which frankly were more or less inevitable, were themselves a central and critical part of the project’s failure.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q99</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Bacon:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I don’t want to misrepresent what Mr Linwood said, but he sounded as if he was trying to pin the blame for the failure on the folk at BBC Vision. I have the revised business case in front of me, and the names on the front of it, apart from Mr Linwood himself as the chief technology officer, are: </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Kerstin </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Mogull</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, who is also a technology person; John Turner, who is also from the technology division; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Erik Huggers</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, who was the director of the technology division; and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Zarin</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Patel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> as CFO. There was nobody at all from BBC Vision sponsoring the revised business case. The business case wasn’t driven by BBC Vision, although there might well have been BBC Vision people involved at some point. It sounds to me as if the people getting the business case through the main governance processes were technology and finance people. I want to be clear on what you are saying. It sounds to me as if the technology people were very gung-ho and the experience of the business people on the ground was that it was not necessarily working as well as they had been led to believe, so they probably lost faith in it. Is that a fair summary?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mark Thompson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I believe that that was definitely what started to happen, certainly by the end of 2011 and through 2012. It happened for understandable reasons. This has been a troubled project. I came to you in February 2011 to talk about a previous difficult period towards the end of the relationship with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Siemens</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. The point I am trying to make is that I think the lack of confidence on the business side—I differ a little from John on this point—was, in large measure, justified by the difficulties we had had with the project. I thought great efforts were made in BBC Vision and in BBC North both by senior people and by some front-line programme makers to help us to get the thing to work.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Where my perspective perhaps differs from John’s perspective—it is very easy for me to sit here and say that this project failed because some difficult programme makers refused to use it, although there may have been an element of that somewhere—is that I thought that, overall, this was a project on which there was a lot of work and effort to try to get it to work on the business side. Although the business side might not be represented in the signatures or names on the business case, they would have been heavily involved.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I have one word of caution, and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Zarin</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> might want to touch on this. I have read Mr Garrett’s written evidence and I cannot shed too much light on it.

One of the things that I am concerned about is that you were able, Mr Thompson, to portray this as working well—I am quite prepared to accept that that is what you believed, because the various layers of management at the BBC had said that—and yet now, with hindsight, we have compelling evidence that that was not an accurate reflection of what was happening on the ground.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The present Report from the NAO highlights what might have been a reason for that. If you look at </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">paragraph 1.6</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, it reminds us that “when the business case for the DMI was approved by the BBC Trust in June 2010, the director of future media and technology was responsible. The BBC transferred executive-level responsibility for technology to its chief operating officer”—that is you, Ms Thomson—“in March 2011 following a reorganisation. It transferred responsibility again in September 2012, to its chief financial officer, following another reorganisation.” We read later on that you, Ms Patel, did not go to the board meetings but that one of your team used to go on your behalf. This business-critical, really expensive business transformation programme was being passed between people without any board-level champion, and that is the ABC of management, is it not?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mark Thompson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think, first, you are pointing at a very important area in terms of the story of the project. I was responsible for one reorganisation in that story. There are two or three in there, but I was responsible for one. Let me tell you what we were trying to do. When Erik Huggers left as head of technology, the BBC was facing a period with a colossal number of very, very big projects. A not-complete list would include digital switchover, the launching of BBC North, the building of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Cardiff</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> drama village, the launch of the new Broadcasting House and the Olympic </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">games</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, which itself was an enormous technology project.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Many of these projects were not just technology; they were technology, they were property and they were, in various ways, business-related. Because the projects, in many ways, bumped into each other, connected with each other and had very elaborate interdependencies, we decided that it made sense for Caroline, who was also leading the work on the physical property, to have an overview of property, technology, BBC people—the many issues related to these major projects, some of which you have discussed—as well as strategy and policy. That made sense precisely to make sure that we had a very strong overview, making sure that all of this was being aligned.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Fiona </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mactaggart</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> But our point is that you did not have a very strong overview.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q116</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">This is beyond—just look</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> at the project.

There was quite considerable discussion at the finance committee, which, as you know, I chair. At that meeting, we received various assurances in regard to whether or not the business case was sustainable within the context of the “amber/red”. We then received a further report in December 2011, which was in regard to the same status—it was still at “amber/red”—but with wording within that that gave us some degree of comfort that the actions being taken by the executive board were actually having some effect.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">With the benefit of hindsight and given the statements that I made to this Committee in February 2011, there is no question that a number of mistakes were made by the BBC Trust, which I freely admit to and as chairman of the finance committee am happy to take responsibility for. They are, in order, as far as I am concerned, the following.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">First, following the hearing held here in February 2011, the plan had been that there should be an investigation or examination of the entire project by internal audit. The decision was taken by the executive audit committee to cancel that. I think that was for the very good reason that management of the project argued that they had had the NAO crawling all over them, they had had to make the changes from </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Siemens</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and as a result of that, could they please get some leeway to get on with it? With the benefit of hindsight, that was probably the wrong decision.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Secondly, it is fair to say that there is a clue in the name: the finance committee is there to look after the question of finance. With the benefit of hindsight, we did not have—as the BBC Trust—a sufficient knowledge around technology to be able to question properly, in my view and in my judgment, the statements that were being made, particularly given that the PMO itself was in part reporting from the information that had been given to it by the technology department.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I wish sincerely that we, as the BBC Trust, had appointed outside consultants to keep a very much closer eye than we were able to do on the project, in the technology sense. I recognise that in doing so, I have no doubt that, if the project had gone swimmingly, we would have been criticised heavily for the use of consultants when using them was not necessary. However, given what has happened, I think there is a really interesting lesson around the governance of complicated large-scale projects. So, that is the second issue.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The third issue—to be blunt about it—is that I think we gave the executive team too much leeway in time terms between the end of 2011 and the middle of 2012. With the benefit of hindsight, I wish we had taken action quicker.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q126</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Nick Smith:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You said there was an “amber/red” light in the autumn of 2011; you talked about the cancellation report and audit; and you said that the Trust was out of its depth in not having anybody who had a good oversight of IT during that whole period. It seems to me that the Trust was not really fit for purpose in a really important part of the BBC’s work.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Anthony Fry:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There is no paper between the evidence given by me and the statements made by Mr Thompson in regard to the fact that it is quite clear from the NAO Report and the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">PricewaterhouseCoopers </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">report that the information flowing to the executive board was no different to the information flowing up from the executive board to the Trust. Given that, I would say to you that there is no governance system known to mankind—you can criticise the Trust, you can criticise the structure, you could put in place a unitary board, but there is absolutely no evidence that a unitary board, being governed by </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Ofcom</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> or any other variations on that, would have made any difference to the outcome here. This is not a “governance by the Trust” issue, with respect. I wish personally and sincerely that, having made the statements I made in front of this Committee in February 2011, we had been able to take more actions than we did. That is a personal statement by me, as chairman of the finance committee.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I think it is an open question, whereas if I had spent 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days of the year doing nothing but focusing on DMI, would the outcome have been different?

We should have scratched more; there is no doubt. It would be foolish of me to sit here and say to you that we did absolutely everything we could have done. Whether the outcome would have been different is more questionable, given what we now know: this is not a question of the executive board having information that it did not pass to the Trust.

Mr Fry has talked about the Trust’s point of view. I think that from November 2011, senior managers were very active. You have heard about very significant changes in the project team. There was a big effort involving all of us—special meetings, an extraordinary version of the steering group with all the key directors—both Caroline and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Zarin</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> were there—and I was involved in many conversations on the business side to see whether we could bring the business side of the project closer together.

There were clear issues in July 2009, 18 months into the project, when it was taken in house. It was taken in house from Siemens on a no-fault basis, with a £26 million write-off of the benefits. Clearly, there was BBC fault as part of that termination. Can you outline the issues that were identified from a Trust perspective by the BBC as being BBC-controlled? How were those issues handled differently once the project was taken in house? Given the increased risk, what evidence did you, on behalf of the Trust, require to see whether those risks were being addressed? If they were not, what did you do about it?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Anthony Fry:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The monitoring by the BBC Trust of this project was consistent throughout. As I remember it—as you know, I was not chairman of the finance committee at the time—the BBC came with its revised business case, which was discussed at the finance committee and by the main Trust. There was the scrutiny that you would expect from a supervisory body. A budget was agreed for that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In terms of the nature of the Siemens contractual arrangements, we discussed that at length at the 2011 hearing, and I am not sure there is much benefit in discussing that now. In terms of the overall monitoring, I have already said that, with the benefit of hindsight, I do not believe the BBC Trust had sufficient technological expertise. Nor were we able, for whatever reason, to get any greater clarity as to the progress of what was happening with the BBC than, it appears from the evidence of both PwC and the NAO, the executive board itself of the BBC had. And at no stage was there any discussion of the question whether, if the project was going so badly wrong, there should be a write-off in the annual report and accounts as late as 2012.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q162</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Stephen Barclay:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Mr Fry, with respect, you are not answering my question. My question was as follows. This was a high-risk project that was put out externally, on a fixed-term contract, because of the risk. It then went wrong, in part because of errors made by the BBC. At that point, you decided that, having taken it external because of Siemens’ expertise, you were going to bring it internal, assuming that your in-house capability was even more skilled than Siemens. So there was clearly a higher risk to this. What I’m trying to establish is, given that higher risk—this is as early as July 2009, bearing it in mind that it then took several years and several DGs before it was scrapped—what additional oversight did the Trust put in place?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Anthony Fry:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> As to the risk level, I commented on that at the February 2011 hearing, if you remember, when I said that by definition, having taken this in house—I have described the profile around the reporting, which came through, first, the project management office quarterly reports—we discussed it with internal audit every six months. We met with the chairman of the audit committee every three months. We had a risk report on a regular basis.

We know that; it’s in the Report. I am asking about a much earlier stage, when there was a red rag on this project. You had put it out because it was high risk. It had failed in part because of the BBC. It then came back. If the project’s scope and the purpose changed over time, does that not increase the risk?

What I’m driving at is this: we had a hearing with you; you were one of the witnesses; you were sat next to Mr Huggers. It had gone significantly wrong with Siemens. You then take it in house. You tell the Committee, “The lesson we learned from that is the importance of having clear and effective project governance.” And then several years later, you come to us on the same project and say, “I accept the Trust hasn’t put clear and effective governance in place.” You must personally carry responsibility for that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Anthony Fry:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> With respect, I have already accepted that—looking back on what happened—yes, the governance failed.

If I had been sitting on the audit committee, and if I had been sitting as the chief auditor, my advice would have clearly been that in the absence of being able to give a definitive number, the only sensible conclusion would be write the whole lot off.

The other thing we were aware of was that the archive database—the piece that is still being used, although I am told that it is by no means perfect—was replacing a system that was falling apart. That part of the DMI project was urgently needed by the business. It represented quite a lot of the planned spend in 2012, and it was widely believed—this turned out to be the case—that that part of DMI would be of significant use, and it is still being used currently. That was also a factor in carrying on with that segment.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I and others attended a very large number of meetings about trying to get DMI back on its feet in 2012, so it got intense scrutiny. As </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Zarin</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and Caroline said, I do not think that we did everything as quickly as we could have done, but it was getting a lot of attention. I think it has less to do with the changing of the guards in the DG’s office and more to do with the fact that we were simultaneously trying—indeed, succeeding—in getting BBC North going, working on the new Broadcasting House and working on the Olympics. It was a very busy period.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q180</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Stephen Barclay:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> But you knew that when you took it back in house.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mark Thompson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes, we did.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q181</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Stephen Barclay:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> That is the point. People keep talking about 2012, but the risks were material and there in 2009. In fact, it was identified as high-risk in 2008 when it was put out to Siemens on a fixed-term contract. You knew that the BBC was contributing to the problems when you had a no-fault settlement. On top of that, there were capability gaps in the team, there was no SRO, and you were going through a reorganisation of the IT function. There were a whole lot of other risk indicators in 2009, so you cannot keep saying that you only really realised that things were going wrong in 2012. Mr Linwood, again, said in September 2010 that the goalposts were being moved and the deadline had moved beyond </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Salford</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. So it was not just a one-off with a number of other competing business demands. You took the decision to take it in house. That was a very risky decision, and it then seems that you did not put in place additional governance to help to mitigate that, which is why the Trust was left in the dark.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mark Thompson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think that there is some justice in what you say. It was very high risk. Although we believed at the time that we were putting in place adequate governance, history suggests that we did not do that. That is right. Can I address one very basic point? Why did we go for DMI in the first place? In 2000, when I was director of television at the BBC, I had cancelled a rather similar project called </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Darwin</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> because I thought that the difficulty of scale and complexity of an end-to-end system was too great and the chances of its working were too low. Essentially, it was ahead of its time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What happened between 2000 and the inception of DMI was really two things. First, because of all the building we were doing and the needs of the business, there was a danger that we were going to end up with competing different systems that would not talk to each other in different parts of the organisation. We had successfully built a system for BBC Scotland at Pacific Quay, but the rest of the BBC, for a variety of reasons, many of them </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">justified,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> felt that that was not quite right. There was a danger that we were going to end up with a Salford system, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Bristol</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> system, a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Birmingham</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> system, a W1 system, a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Cardiff</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> system and so on. That was the first thing: avoid ending up in front of the PAC talking about why you are wasting money building five different systems to do the same job.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The second point was that we had done PQ successfully. We had done it successfully, or were on the way to success, in terms of digital—in the jargon—end-to-end work flow in BBC news and in radio, so we felt we had some successes either already there or looking good, and those systems have worked well. We felt that if we did not go for an overarching architecture for it, we would end up with a bit of a dog’s dinner of different systems. So that was the reason why—knowing that it was high-risk, knowing that the issues of scaling were going to be very difficult, knowing the complexity of different geographies, different kinds of programme and different kinds of activity, and the fact that everything is moving; the technology is changing, the business is changing, and the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">iPlayer</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> had not been launched by the time we were beginning to think about DMI. That meant it was very high risk, but to be honest, the one thing you will not find any of us disagreeing on is that it was high risk right through its life.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q182</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Stephen Barclay: </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">If it is the case that it was high risk through its life, why were you telling us in February 2011 that it was all on track for implementation?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mark Thompson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Because every indication I had—from my own experiences talking directly to people on the ground, from all the briefing that I was getting, from what I took to be complete open-book, external perspectives—was that actually, the project was in a really good state.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I will take Ian, Jackie, then I will come in and ask about the future a little bit, and then we will close the session.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q183</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Ian Swales:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> May I bring in Mr Coles, who has been sitting very patiently?

The review that we undertook, back in October 2012, of DMI was extensive and comprehensive, over six months. It involved Accenture, as you know, for five weeks. We entered that review optimistically. Although the project was suffering and it was clearly in trouble, we were hopeful that we could identify at least parts of the project that had value and were of sufficient value that it would justify the extra licence fee payers’ money, in terms of investing further in it. Unfortunately, by the end of that review, we did not find anything that we felt had enduring value. As Anthony very eloquently put it, we decided, from a prudent accounting perspective, to write everything down to zero.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q186</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Hang on a minute.

If we are to gain anything from this, we need to focus on lessons learned and how that informs future thinking. What we have seen is yet further examples of the weaknesses in the internal governance and the leadership culture of the BBC that allowed this waste to happen. There has been poor project management, a lack of a senior responsible owner and a lack of determination to drive it through the culture, because we are talking about a transformational change. Going forward, are there any reflections within the BBC on what changes need to be made to the organisation’s leadership culture?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dominic Coles:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Absolutely. I can give the Committee an assurance that we have already overhauled how we manage our major projects. Culture is one aspect of that. There is this expression, “Culture eats strategy for breakfast”. That is true, and it is certainly true in the BBC, so we want to try to change the culture of the organisation. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Tony Hall’s</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> announcements about the way in which we are addressing the board structures—we are getting rid of boards and we are pushing down accountability throughout the organisation so that everyone is aware of individual accountabilities across the organisation. We are reflecting that in how we are going to be managing major projects going forward. We are appointing single responsible owners for all of our major projects, so that there is no confusion as to who is the individual accountable for delivering the project.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Because we are changing the board structure, we are putting more responsibility directly into the executive board. The PMO will independently review all our major projects on a monthly—no longer a quarterly—basis, and it will report to the executive board on a monthly basis. The executive board will have two extra non-executive directors as well, so that there is more challenge at the executive board level. The executive board themselves have given the commitment to the Trust that they will be reporting on a more regular basis when projects go into exceptional circumstances—so, where there are special measures or where they go red.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We have also introduced a far more rigorous—we are calling it an integrated assurance and audit plan. That effectively means that all our projects will require particular milestones throughout their progress, and stage gates where they are reviewed. They are reviewed by internal audit, they are reviewed by external audit and, most importantly for the highly complex and really technical challenging projects such as this one, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">they</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> are going to get some external assurance. That is what I think was missing throughout the DMI project, and that is what we will be getting right here.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q200</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jackie Doyle-Price:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What about engagement with the Trust?

I have detected in some of the answers—I recognise that Mr Thompson apologised for what has been a waste of money—particularly from Ms Patel, a complete complacency about the fact that this is licence fee payers’ money. We need to make sure that the BBC culture reflects the fact that they are accountable for money taken from taxpayers. We have seen practices that are, frankly, arrogant towards taxpayers.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dominic Coles:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> As the representative of the current BBC management, I will reiterate what Tony Hall said at the time: this was a shocking waste of money.

We are chunking it up into definable separate projects, each with its own business plan, objectives and milestones. We are going to be delivering those—looking to the market to deliver those cheaper and with more certainty. We are not going to be delivering it by our own software engineering; we are going to be delivering it by getting the right things for the BBC. One of the problems with DMI was that the marketplace moved on so quickly over the period in which DMI was delivering that a lot of these tools were available off the shelf. We are going to capitalise on that now and make sure that we deliver to our production areas tools that they need now. What I will be doing—I give a commitment to this Committee—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">is</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> that we will be completely changing the way in which we oversee this project.

It is absolutely accepted that I played no part at all in that decision. I heard—it turns out after the investigation had already been cancelled—about the fact that “</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Newsnight</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">” had been investigating Jimmy </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Savile</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> as a result of a chance conversation at a drinks party. A BBC correspondent said words to the effect of, “You must be worried about ‘</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Newsnight</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’ and Jimmy </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Savile</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,” or some such. What I recall is </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">an incredibly brief conversation—I cannot recall whether it was face to face or on the phone—in which I was told that “</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Newsnight</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">” itself had decided not to proceed with the investigation and that the matter was closed. That is all I can remember. I have a good memory, and it is all I can remember from the call. I subsequently understand that Helen has a different recollection of that conversation, but I want to make it very clear that my recollection is that I heard about the existence of the investigation not from any kind of referral or meeting but simply because I bumped into someone who raised it incredibly briefly at a drinks party. I made a mental note. I had a very brief conversation in which I was told that “</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Newsnight</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">” had abandoned the investigation and that the matter was closed. That is the full extent, and it is what I told Nick Pollard. That is my memory of the event.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Jackson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Thank you.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Okay.

My reflection, thinking back on it, is that there was a jungle of bureaucracy at that time. The bureaucracy was almost beyond parody, which is one of the issues. Rather sadly, there have also been some half-truths around the place. I just think that the BBC deserves better.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Bacon:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You might get a good sitcom out of it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Thank you.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><br style="page-break-before:always; clear:both" /></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="line-height:28pt; margin:14pt 0pt 9pt"><span style="color:#005232; font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman'; font-size:10pt">              </span><span style="color:#005232; font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman'; font-size:10pt">Oral evidence: [Inquiry name]</span><span style="color:#005232; font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman'; font-size:10pt">, HC </span><span style="color:#005232; font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman'; font-size:10pt">[</span><span style="color:#005232; font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman'; font-size:10pt">XXX</span><span style="color:#005232; font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman'; font-size:10pt">]</span><span style="color:#005232; font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman'; font-size:10pt">              </span><span style="color:#005232; font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman'; font-size:10pt">              </span><span style="color:#005232; font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 55 Roman'; font-size:10pt">2</span></p></div></body></html>
