I have recently started cycling to work after many years as a train commuter and driver.  My journey takes me </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">through busy sections of Surrey and London, along major and minor roads.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">2. It is my opinion that cycling is not safe enough on our roads.  In two months I have had 2 physical scrapes with cars and many more near misses.  To me</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> the root cause is that at r</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ush hour drivers do not want to be held up (we all leave it to the last minute in the mornings) and this sets up a conflict for the driver who may end up making a more risky manoeuvre and pass more closely than they would do normally.  I have noticed that </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">at quiet times, drivers tend to leave </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">me </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">more room.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">  It could be said then that congestion levels and waking up late are as much to blame as driver errors.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">  </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">3. I have witnessed equally bad behaviour by cyclists.  Whilst stopping at a roundabout last week </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">for a car coming from the right, a cyclist overtook me and went straight over the roundabout narrowly missing a car.  Their perception of a safe gap was very different from mine and the car drivers. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">4.  </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">HGVs are just plain scary.  Even at 6 feet the wind </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">and spray can cause shock if you’re not ready for it.  When they turn left, they simply can’t see you much of the time.  I do believe that HGVs need to be redesigned or retrofitted with mirrors that help drivers.  I also think that more research is needed </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">into safety features that prevent cyclists from going under the wheels.  For cyclists, cycle training/awareness campaigns that create a gradual shift in attitude is needed so that some of us realise we do need to stop from time to time no matter how inconv</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">enient. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">5. Segregated cycling is much more comfortable and this should be available on all possible routes.  Lanes and </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">cycle </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">tracks involving more than just a white line to separate cars are the best.  As we have seen in London on the CS’s, a painted </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">rout</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">e is not sufficient.  Raised kerbs as barriers or wide shared pavements are better.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">6. Segregation is not always possible particularly in historic towns where roads are narrow.  Thus we must learn to get along better on roads. A period of zero tolerance po</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">licing could work but it must be accompanied by </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">an advertising campaign that ensures everybody knows it is happening and the offer of free cycle/driver awareness training for all. With many people cycling to save money, requiring extra insurance for cyclis</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ts is a step too far and would discourage thousands.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">7. I would urge the govern</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ment to take action immediately.  If we want cycling to be a major form of commuter transport, things are only going to get worse.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">November 2013</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
