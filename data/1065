In February 2011, the blanket ban remained. It appears the UK has little choice but to reform in order to comply with EU directives from the Hirst 2005 case, and the EU Convention on Human Rights. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Victim Support recognises the positive role social responsibility and citizenship can play on a prisoners’ rehabilitation process and that in some cases this may contribute to reductions in reoffending. However, there is currently little </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">available </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">by the way of a robust evidence base to show the positive impact of citizenship on reductions in reoffending.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">At Victim Support we strongly believe in the rehabilitation of offenders as a means to reduce further offending. But we </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">don’t have the evidence to comment </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">on the issue of prisoners voting without evidence to clearly demonstrate the link between the enfranchisement of offenders and lower recidivism.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Different victims will feel differently on this issue – there is no one single viewpoint. But what is clear is that this issue has been drawn out for far too long and has taken up too much of government and the public’s time. What is needed is a clear and swift decision so that the government can concentrate instead on what should be the most important issue – the needs of victims of crime, whose confidence in the justice system is already far too low and who too often feel marginalised by the criminal justice process.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">In conclusion, at Victim Support we believe that the government’s focus should shift from offender</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">s’</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> rights to the rights and needs of victims of crime.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">June 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
