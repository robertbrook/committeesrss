The Cambridge Infectious Diseases SRI aims to meet this need by promoting and facilitating all forms of infectious disease research including interdisciplinary efforts, together with the associated training and capacity building. Drawing together over 300 researchers from more than 30 departments and institutes, scientific strengths are broad and range from fundamental biological research through to drug development, sociology, anthropology, engineering and science policy. Representation on the CID Committee encompasses numerous schools and departments, together with external but closely allied organisations including the Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, the PHG Foundation, and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. CID members with specific expertise in AMR include those who use microbiological, molecular and modelling approaches to gain a better understanding of the role of non-human animals in the emergence and spread of AMR, and groups that are translating microbial genomics into diagnostic and public health microbiology to detect, characterise and control the spread of multidrug resistant pathogens in hospitals and the community. </span></li></ol></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 6pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">How has antimicrobial resistance developed in the past decade?</span></p><ol start="2" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><ol start="2" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 13.25pt; padding-left:15.1pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The emergence and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance is a function of pathogen evolution, and has been selected for by antibiotic use. Bacteria generally have a short doubling time (under laboratory conditions, bacteria can divide as rapidly as every 20 minutes). Added to this, the bacterial genome undergoes frequent change (either by mutation or by acquiring new DNA from other bacteria). This process of evolution is random, but a genetic change that is associated with a fitness advantage for the bacterium may lead to an expansion of the new ‘clone’, particularly if the trait undergoes selection. Antibiotic use represents a strong evolutionary driver for the selection of resistance in bacteria in general, including those that cause disease in humans and animals and those that are not pathogenic and are commensals (part of the normal flora). Importantly, the normal flora can act as a reservoir for resistance, although this rarely comes to our attention  - either because non-pathogens are filtered out in diagnostic microbiology workflows, or because they are simply not culturable using current culture methods. This is particularly true for anaerobes (bacteria that cannot grow in the presence of oxygen).  </span></li></ol></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.35pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-28.35pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="3" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><ol start="3" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 13.25pt; padding-left:15.1pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Antibiotic use can be regarded as appropriate, or as inappropriate.

Under such circumstances, these life-saving drugs are essential for the success of every aspect of medical care (e.g. to prevent surgical infections, to treat infections in people who are immunocompromised because of cancer therapy or transplantation, to treat infections of livestock or companion animals, etc). For cases of severe infection, broad-spectrum antibiotics are prescribed before the causative pathogen has been isolated from clinical specimens by the diagnostic microbiology laboratory and tested for antimicrobial resistance – after which, changes can be made to a more targeted, narrow-spectrum drug regimen. The administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics leads to very </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">profound changes in the normal human microbial flora; antibiotic-susceptible flora are eradicated, and only those bacteria that are resistant to the antibiotic in use can survive and replicate.  It is predictable, therefore, that the flora of patients in hospital frequently undergoes a fundamental change. Bacteria are shed into the environment, and can be transmitted between patients through contact with other patients or inanimate objects, or via the hands of healthcare workers. Passage of hospital flora through sequential patients, each of whom are given antimicrobial drugs, can lead to amplification of resistance and the emergence of bacterial strains that have acquired a large number of resistance mechanisms, resulting in multidrug resistance. This is particularly the case in intensive care units, where antimicrobial drugs are frequently used. Under such circumstances, the emergence of resistance is an unwanted side effect of appropriate medical care. </span></li></ol></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.35pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-28.35pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="5" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><ol start="5" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 13.25pt; padding-left:15.1pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The use of antimicrobial drugs may also be inappropriate.  This includes the prescribing of antibiotics for diseases that are not caused by bacteria (e.g. viral infections, which can be difficult to distinguish from bacterial infections), the use of antibiotics in livestock for reasons other than the treatment of infection, and the sale and use of over-the-counter antimicrobial drugs.

This ‘stratified medicine’ approach depends on genomic data from these tests being submitted to the UK HIV resistance database (UK HIVRDB; maintained by an MRC grant and a collaborative consortium of virologists in the UK) where it can be accessed by clinicians nationwide. Such databases underpin predictive algorithms that report the susceptibility or resistance of individual patient’s infections to different treatments, with each additional genome submitted by a laboratory to the database having the potential to increase the accuracy of treatment decisions for all future patients. The government should ensure that lessons are learned from the success of HIVRDB and that similar data sharing and analysis initiatives are established across the various academic and public sector organisations currently undertaking bacterial whole genome sequencing.</span></li></ol></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.35pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-28.35pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="19" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><ol start="19" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18.75pt; padding-left:9.6pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">It will be essential to fully integrate microbial sequencing into the NHS, since it is likely that large hospitals will wish to undertake local microbial sequencing to support infection control and outbreak investigation, and to define optimal antimicrobial therapy for some infectious </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">diseases where genomics provides a faster or more complete read-out than conventional testing.
