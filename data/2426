The </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">applicant</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> had two young children, both of whom were British citizens.

PLP was told on two separate occasions that a funding decision would be made the week before the </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">applicant’s</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> hearing date, so as to enable lawyers to be instructed if funding was granted.
