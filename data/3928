The Minister claimed that because of the decision £750 million will not be spent by customers on subsidising it. But if he had looked at the table from which that came, he would have also seen that, actually, you are forgoing the chance to save many </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">hundreds of millions of pounds from gas customers’ bills—and that was in the worst case. In the three other cases, each time it showed that, in taking into account anything that the customers might pay on some subsidy mechanism plus the amount they would save by the facility being there, according to the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Redpoint</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> numbers, it was a no-brainer and it should be built.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q3</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you others agree?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">George Grant:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I would totally endorse that.

Clearly there is concern about costs that are being placed on consumers at the moment. But, as Tony says, if you look at the report that the Government commissioned, the net benefit to consumers over a period of time was in the tens of millions, or possibly even the hundreds of millions of pounds. Being economical with the figures is not in the best interests of consumers and we have heard a great deal in recent months about the focus being on costs and doing what is right for consumers.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q4</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You were talking about the net benefit being over time.

I think there was enough in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Redpoint</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> report for the Minister to make a positive decision on that. He chose not to, which I can only assume was a political decision. I think that, as a consequence of that, some of the projects that were ready to go if support was provided, will now not be available, should that decision be reviewed later on.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jo </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Vizor</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I have a different opinion. I looked at the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Redpoint</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> report and I can see the numbers that are being discussed. I also see a cost and an impact on existing storage operations, which are not considered in those numbers of benefits—what happens to the existing assets and the detrimental effect, and how existing storage operations would be dealt with. I also think that there is a very interesting way that these numbers are being looked at. Reports that I have seen have quoted that the cost of a subsidy would be £30 million to £35 million in some of the reporting of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Redpoint</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> analysis. My understanding is that what is being looked for—4 billion cubic metres of long-range storage development—is actually more of a guarantee of £1.9 billion of income. That is for a single storage site, not for the industry as a whole to ensure that all of the various types of storage that we need going forward are in place and are economic.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr White:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I disagree with some of that, I’m afraid. In tables 38 and 37 of the report, it shows clearly the impact on consumers, on suppliers and on the people in the storage business. So they do take those into account. Yes, in some of the cases, some of the storage is negatively impacted—actually, in all of them—but in some it is still a kind of positive benefit. It is helpful to distinguish between two types of storage. There are the smaller-scale, fast-acting storage facilities, which are price takers—so if there is a high </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">price you sell, and if there is a low price you buy and you do not have an impact on prices.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What I was really considering was large-scale storage, where you buy in the summer when prices are low and you don’t have much of an impact on the price then, because it is oversupplied. Then by selling in the winter you have a big impact on the overall price—you lower it. So there is a benefit that goes across to everybody. The trouble with large-scale storage is that whoever builds it doesn’t get the total benefit, because it is shared over all the consumers. This is one of those cases where, yes, markets do work, but there are things that the market does and things that Governments do. One of my heroes, Adam Smith, said that there are three things Governments do: one is to ensure you don’t get invaded, two is to ensure you have rule of law, and the third is to do various public works. I would argue, gentlemen, that this is one of the cases for public works.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q5</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Ms </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Vizor</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, you were saying that the impact on existing storage</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">had not been worked out—what would be the consequences of that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jo </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Vizor</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The consequences in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Redpoint</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> analysis</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> suggest that there is a negative effect of around £110 million under the cases in the tables. Two pages further on, it says that under different circumstances the actual effect on fast-churn storage—the storage needed to balance the market going forward, and to help to move towards a lower-carbon economy and ensure that there are gas supplies day-to-day when the UK customer needs them—could actually be something like £300 million a year of negative adverse effect, for 10 years. According to my simple maths, that is about £3 billion of adverse effect. I don’t know where the offsetting impact of that would come from. We would provide a subsidy for seasonal storage, but we are potentially taking £3 billion away from the existing storage facilities that are balancing our gas market now.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q6</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So it would impact on existing storage.

I would not expect there to be intervention that would treat existing and new assets differentially, so if intervention came along, I would expect there to be some measure of balance between new and existing assets. If we see intervention come along towards supporting seasonal storage assets, I have concerns that the market would not bring forward other investments that we have seen across a range of gas investments over recent years, whether that is liquid natural gas, pipelines, interconnectors or storage facilities, because there would be a real concern about the future impact on the value of those investments.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">George Grant:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The problem with some of the points that Jo is making is that there is no detail as to what the proposed method of intervention is. The modelling from </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Redpoint</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> looks at scenarios where additional gas storage is built in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and the benefit to consumers from the downward pressure on prices, which I think even Jo would agree is generally positive. I would agree with her when she says that any mechanism that is brought in will need to deal with existing storage and ensure that it is not detrimentally impacted, because we still need that capacity as well.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">To say that the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Redpoint</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> report is saying that existing storage will be detrimentally impacted and new storage will benefit—you cannot draw that conclusion from the report. The conclusion you can draw is that there is a net benefit to consumers from having more storage in the system. That is the point the Government have missed and that this Committee focused on back in 2011, when you were looking at energy security in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and recommended that the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> should double gas storage. I think the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Redpoint</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> report endorses that recommendation, and I would expect that you are also disappointed that that recommendation was not followed.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q7</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Are you still going ahead with your </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Irish sea</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> scheme?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">George Grant:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Absolutely not, no.

There has been a move to try and get the prices indexed to the market price and make them more spot pricing. Some of the suppliers are saying, “Yeah, okay, we will move off oil indexation, but we will now move to spot pricing.” But in your original contracts, you had a certain amount of flexibility. Let’s say you would be buying 5 </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">bcm</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> a year.

Storage is just one part of that mix. We have to recognise that, yes, we need flexible gas supplies. We need to balance and to make sure that gas is available for customers when they need it. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There are a number of different ways of providing that flexibility, of which storage is just one. At the moment intervention is not needed to provide additional flexibility. In some ways you could view the change of swing contracts as being that there is too much flexibility in the market and it cannot be fully utilised. What we are seeing at the moment is a world where there are a range of scenarios. I go back to Mr Robertson’s point. One </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">of the key criteria here is around the affordability to the consumer because to guarantee or to subsidise will take money today and add to customers’ bills. We are very acutely aware of how difficult it is for energy to be affordable to homes and businesses in the current climate.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Roddy</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Monroe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Just a point on that. I think the subsidy that was under consideration was a revenue floor for gas storage operators. That cost would only be incurred once the facility was up and running and operating in the market. It would have an impact on costs. There are different views of what this cost would be, but I think in one of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Redpoint’s</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> assessments it was £4 million over the 10 years. In one assessment it was very trivial and in the other it was greater depending on where spreads ended up. But the central point is that if the floor mechanism with a cap is introduced, customers would not see the impact until the facilities were built and up and running, which is seven, eight years down the track. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr White:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> And even then they might not operate.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Roddy</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Monroe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> My second point is about the amount of flexibility there is at the moment. You need different sorts of flexibility. You need stuff that can react very quickly: so when you need to fire up your combined cycle gas turbines, when the wind dies down, you need to generate more power. So you need your fast cycle stuff. There may well be a lot of capacity that can provide that. What I think was being looked at here was seasonal flexibility—a long duration of sustainable gas coming into the country. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">When you look at what happened last March when I(</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">) went down, I don’t think we were in a particularly comfortable position where we had lots of flexibility that we could call upon. The LNG wasn’t turning up; storage was very close to being exhausted. So you were very much reliant on your interconnectors, and when one went down, things weren’t very comfortable. Had that gone on for a considerable time we would be in a slightly different place than we are today. Fortunately, it came back within a couple of hours, but had it gone out for a week to 10 days, I think things would have got a lot more hairy.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q13</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Albert Owen:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Before I come on to that security of supply issue specifically with Mr Monroe, may I ask Ms </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Vizor</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> from E.ON about the storage facility?

I think they peaked within days. They went up something like 50%—they were around £1 and they went up to £1.50—and I think had that been sustained for any longer period, then there would have been some customers turning down. I think there would have been a demand-side response as a result of those high prices, to balance the network. If you think about the gas market as roughly three equally sized bits—one is the power sector, one is the manufacturing and one is the domestic side—you think, “Were we likely to run out of gas for our household, our domestic customers?” then the answer to that is that it was highly unlikely, because of the amount of demand-side response that there is out there—if you like, two thirds.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q18</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Albert Owen:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What about the other two sections, then?

What you would have hoped would have happened is that the prices would have stayed at £1.50, gone up a bit, and then that would have attracted some of the cargoes that were Asia-bound.

So I don’t think the price rises we have seen recently are totally unconnected with what was going on in March. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jo </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Vizor</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I just want to give a slightly different perspective again. I am not sure how different the situation would have been had we had more commercially operated seasonal storage, because the whole mentality of that type of storage is that it fills during the summer and empties during the winter. Therefore by the end of March you would have expected that storage to have also been empty. So unless what we are actually talking about is gas in store that is locked away for these very extreme circumstances, then a commercially operated seasonal storage would have given us more storage capacity and given us more ability to shape the winter demand, but wouldn’t necessarily have given us any more gas in store by the end of March.

We saw a situation in which LNG had been pulled into the Far East, largely because of nuclear outages in Japan, so the LNG in the UK was depleted—our storage was depleted—and, as we came to the end of the winter, we saw prices spike. If you compare that with the future price for next winter’s gas, it cost the economy—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> consumers—about £400 million.

They did some analysis and looked at different scenarios about how quickly LNG would respond. Then, in their analysis, they layered in another seasonal storage facility and noted the difference. From that, they found that there was no demand-side reduction and prices were maintained at a reasonably low level. I am willing to share that paper with the Committee, because it helps to answer the question about what difference more seasonal storage would have made had it been available during this winter.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q23</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Albert Owen:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> If I could move on to the North sea, would the gas fields be ramped up to meet demand, or would we have to rely on LNG imports?

Two points are relevant. First, the availability of domestic production is declining. I think we are all aware of that. In 2005, the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> was still capable of meeting 100% of our gas requirements. In a very short space of time, we are down to about 50% from domestic reserves now. Another relevant fact is that the flexibility from that gas production is decreasing, largely because gas from the Southern gas fields was generally from pure gas fields, and they were flexible fields. The majority of the gas being produced now is referred to as associated gas—it is produced along with oil—so the production profile is being driven by oil production rather than gas production.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q24</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Albert Owen:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So it is the wrong type of gas.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">George Grant:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It is the wrong type of gas.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I should remind the Committee of my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests to do with the oil and gas industry, particularly a shareholding in Shell.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q25</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Albert Owen:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I have a final point to make.

The LNG contracts are being signed today and all have diversion clauses in them. The shipper of that LNG has the ability to divert that ship to a different market if there is a higher price in that market. The price difference is shared with the original customer and the supplier. As you say, if the price is allowed to rise high enough, you can attract supplies from elsewhere around the world. The supply still will not be there tomorrow, because there might be a ship on the high seas, but you will have the ability to attract gas to the market if you are prepared to allow those prices to go wherever they need to.

When sources of supply are removed lower down the stack through, for example, some sort of infrastructure failure, that is when you have to attract those higher prices. Seasonal storage means that you have more of the lower-price stack, so you do not have to go out to the LNG market to attract. That is the whole point, because otherwise you are fighting the Asian markets to attract those cargoes across. I think George is right, but I am not sure that all cargos have diversion rights.

The problem with putting French-style public service obligations on the use of storage is that you have to forecast when the demand will be there. The market actually is very good at taking gas out when it is needed and putting it back in when it is not. If you look at this winter, which I think is a good winter, although with large seasonal distortions, as storage got close to empty, the gas taken out was reduced as people preserved the stocks and they put it back in when prices dipped down. So the market is very good at knowing when to dispatch storage—probably better than any forecast would be, I suggest.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr White:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I am not sure I completely agree with that because the thing that always concerns me is the thing that you are not expecting. As I said, we have had almost one a year for the past 10 years. Maybe there will be a need to keep a certain minimum amount of storage in a storage facility in future, were you to have a floor put on your margin over a year for a new facility. Maybe that is something.

We all speak fairly regularly with the Energy Intensive Users Group. Many of them are large gas users. In fact, we undertook a survey a couple of years ago to determine whether they felt that an insurance premium, effectively, would be worthwhile if it provided them with additional protection against gas price spikes. They looked at following the Committee’s recommendation to double </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> gas storage at a cost of the order of £4 billion to build that gas storage capacity.

We have seen that energy-intensive users are very exposed to the international gas markets. Many of the small and medium-sized companies have to buy on the spot market and do not have the ability to enter into long-term contracts, so they are very exposed to price spikes and shortages.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q35</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Christopher Pincher:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> That is helpful.

They are very different assets. The period of time to build an LNG import terminal and a gas storage facility would probably be similar and a pipeline may be somewhat quicker. But you are still talking of the order of five years plus, as a minimum. The key difference is that building import capacity—be they pipelines or LNG import terminals—does not mean that the gas will be there when you need it. The difference about building gas storage within your borders is that you have a gas resource that is within the market area, which is accessible when you need it. There is a key difference between import capacity and gas storage capacity within your borders, effectively.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Roddy</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Monroe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think at the moment we have around 190% import capacity compared to our annual average demand. There is no shortage of import capacity, so that is okay. If you look at how we perhaps stack up to similar gas markets with our gas storage, we are woefully short.

Most of the oil industry, when it does that, is expecting returns of 15%, 18% or 20% for doing things. What we are talking about is that to do a storage facility, if you somehow guarantee a return, you can get the return that someone would accept down to maybe 8%. That is the key: how do you get the cost of putting in this infrastructure down? If you provide some sort of floor return for this facility, you get the cost of storage down and the price to customers goes down. That is what happens.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Yes, there is an impact on the existing storage; I won’t deny it.

We believe that fast-churn storage provides the security to move ahead with the renewable build—whether that is biomass, wind or, indeed, nuclear—in terms of a low-carbon agenda, because we then have an ability to provide very flexible gas into the market very quickly. A facility such as </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Holford</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> can provide enough gas in one day to fuel 10 400 MW CCGTs for the full day, or 85 CCGTs for a four-hour</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> period. I think it comes down to how long the wind is not blowing for, in terms of the question you asked.

I should declare that I am on the board of the Crown Estate and we have made money by renting to CCS as well as gas storage. It means that if you want to completely decarbonise, you want electricity and you do not have all-nuclear, you are going to have to do some form of gas storage and you are going to have to do CCS with it.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">George Grant:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Just to reinforce that, the assets that we have in the gas storage sector are principally depleted reservoirs or salt caverns.

On salt caverns, quite a lot of work is being done to look at compressed air energy storage, which they are very suitable for. Both sectors would have a potential future in a low-carbon environment.
