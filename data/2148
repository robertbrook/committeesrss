font-size:11pt">could help to further enhance the protection of NPs.  Concurrent orders</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> can assist in cases where there is the potential for the use of a TRO by a NPA and by the Highway Authority (HA) for repairs for example (many NPAs do not have the statutory role of the HAs but work in partnership with them) or by a NPA seeking to make a temporary TRO to further protect the Park’s special characteristics whilst another less prohibitive permanent order may be in place on the route.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 34pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">In the case of orders or proposed orders by both a NPA and HA, these may cover different lengths of the route and have varying restrictions relating to users or temporally.  These restrictions would be relevant to the grounds of the orders made by the respective authorities.  However under the current legislation, a NPA may not be able to make an order while one by a HA is in force.  One possible solution could be to implement the provisions of the proposed order in part to tie in with the order already in force but this is unnecessarily burdensome in terms of duplication with publicity and consultation requirements and frustrate the imposition of any other order.  The same process does not apply to a HA which could make an order while one by a NPA is in force. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 34pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">In the case of orders made by NPAs there is provision for NPAs to implement TROs in addition to the ones they have previously made.  This power is also available HAs.  This allows for ad hoc restrictions which may not have been foreseen at the time of the original permanent order such as to deal with adverse weather or ecological requirements.  However whilst the potential for concurrent orders exists, it is important to be clear that no prejudice would result from this as a result of consultations ie it would not be used to implement changes which would be subject to proposals to amend a permanent order.  This is similar to the approach adopted whereby a temporary order should not be used as a prelude to making a permanent order where that consultation has already commenced ie if we think that there is a requirement to take permanent action then making a temporary order disabuses that notion.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 34pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">We propose that removing the reference to temporary orders in section 22BC(1)(2)(c) of the RTRA would fit well with the deregulatory function of the proposed Bill and would not result in an additional administrative burden.  This would achieve the objectives of the Bill in a fair and equitable manner.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;
