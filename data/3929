The Department publishes, from time to time, such things as the draft delivery plan before the summer, which describes what we expect to be spent from the LCF fund, but the NAO rightly says that there is further to go in supplementing that information and bringing it together in a single place. It is something </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">we have been trying to do in the past, and it has been frustrating to not manage to do it for technical accounting reasons. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury has now written to the Liaison Committee suggesting a way forward to bring all that together. I understand that they met last night, but I do not know the outcome of that. However, we are committed to making this more transparent, and I hope that we will be able to do so soon. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q3</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> How do you get across whether the spending it supports would have taken place anyway, without the levies? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">John Fiennes:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> For the levies themselves, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">when</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> we are talking about small-scale feed-in tariffs, contracts for difference, or the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">renewables</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> obligation, we are talking about the support of technologies that we believe, with carbon not being fully priced, are not economically viable without that level of support. We examine very closely the levels of support that we provide through those policies to ensure that we keep that up to date. You will be aware that when we believe we can reduce rates, we do that. For example, a banding review for the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">renewables</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> obligation was undertaken recently, and it led to a reduction in support for biomass conversion and for onshore wind, but the evidence said that support was still necessary to allow those technologies to proceed. We certainly hope that over time these technologies will become more competitive; at that stage, the level of support can reduce. I know that Minister Greg Barker has been writing to explain that he hopes that solar PV in particular will be able to continue to reduce its costs; at that stage, no more support would be necessary, which would obviously be a much better outcome for everybody. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q4</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What sort of rationale is used to decide what should be included in, or excluded from, the levy control framework? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">John Fiennes:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We have to remember that the levy control framework is a technical instrument designed to complete the picture of control by covering levy-funded spending.

We have public spending controls on our conventional budgets. There are controls on tax spending and on regulatory measures, through the agreement of those measures, but absent the levy control framework and there will be an element where that technical control is not exercised. The levy control framework was initially intended to provide the technical coverage necessary to ensure that we comply with the requirements of “Managing public money”. That includes things like making sure that we set policy in an affordable way and produce and verify estimates, and making sure that if we are coming in above forecast, we have a robust, agreed plan to bring the amount back down. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">On the elements covered by the LCF cap—that is to say, the feed-in tariff, the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">renewables</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> obligation and the contract for difference—that is an area where we can </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">expect increases in spend over the coming years, as we move towards meeting our 2020 renewable energy target, so this has assumed a greater importance, and it gets used as a way of ensuring that we have thought about the affordability of that increased spend and making the correct trade-offs. However, it is worth distinguishing in our minds between the technical nature of the framework necessary to meet the requirements of “Managing public money”, and the policy impact of the framework, which is designed to make sure that we make sensible, affordable and sustainable decisions about what is spent in meeting the 2020 targets. I think those two elements get a bit tangled up from time to time, and the NAO report, in which we find a lot to agree with, does, we think, tend to blur those in some respects. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">For example, we have joint board involving the Department and the Treasury; it is talked about in the report. The NAO said that it would like that board to spend more time talking about the trade-offs between different objectives within the LCF. Our view is that the board is properly directed at the forecasts to ensure their robustness. The broader policy debate on the right mix of policy measures and renewable technologies is properly done through the normal policy process, but those things can come together. It is fair to say that the LCF has been used to drive the proper policy-making decisions that you would expect from us.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q6</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Where is the decision taken on whether something should be done within the levy control or more generally?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">John Fiennes:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We have an agreement with the Treasury on the scope of the LCF, which includes the warm home discount, the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">renewables</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> obligation, the small-scale feed-in tariff and, in future, the contract for difference.

Regulation is not public expenditure. The Office for National Statistics looked at the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">renewables</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> obligation in 2006, and made a decision that it was imputed tax and spend. At that point, the Treasury took a view on how the control framework needed to adapt to control those costs. It was for that particular purpose. Since then, we have looked at policies and, where we think they will be imputed tax and spend in the ONS classification—as is the case for the three policies that are currently in the framework—they have been put in the framework.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We then looked at the electricity market reforms, CFDs and the capacity mechanism, which will be tax and spend. The Treasury has again said that, as tax and spend, they should fall within the control framework. The control framework is not a tool to try to capture all costs to consumers from regulation and environmental and social policy. That is the distinction, and that is what the purpose of the LCF was. It is also why, in addition to the LCF, we have the bills and prices report, which more clearly breaks down the impact of Government intervention on domestic prices.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">John Fiennes:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> This is why I tried to draw a distinction between the technical thing that the LCF is designed to achieve and the policy elements. Given the name of the LCF, there is a sense that anything inside the LCF is controlled, and anything outside is not controlled, but that is not the case. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Another area where we have a difference of view with the NAO is on the treatment of the energy company obligation, or ECO, which we regard as a regulation, and therefore not within the scope of the LCF as described. That does not mean that it is not monitored. It is closely monitored, and the Department recently published the latest information about the costs of ECO. It does not mean that it is not controlled. There is absolutely a debate about the right level and the right framing for that. It does not mean it will not be considered in the future. There is a lively debate going on about what can be done on the elements that contribute to bills. It is wrong to say that if you are inside the LCF, somehow you are under scrutiny, and if you are outside the LCF, you are not. That is absolutely not the case. That is why I draw a distinction between the policy element and the policy debate, and the technical framework that the LCF is driving.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What goes inside and what comes out seems to be random. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q10</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Graham Stringer:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Can I try to help us both?

You pay for that with higher costs for electricity, through the feed-in tariff, and through the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">renewables</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> obligation. You also need to change the distribution network and make it more intelligent to deal with the intermittent supply, but you only pay for the turbine; you do not pay for what actually distributes the electricity to the consumer. How is that a rational separation of costs, if the definition is that you will pay for these builds? It is effectively a tax on expenditure, because it is just as much tax and expenditure on the distribution system.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">John Fiennes:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I do not think I would agree that it was random. I have tried to set out as clearly as I can the rationale for why things fall one side of the line rather than the other, based on the classification of the nature of the spend that is designed to provide the control framework. It so happens that defining the LCF in this way provides a couple of positive, welcome elements in the policy debate. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">First, setting out a level of spend on these elements for the generation side provides some confidence to investors that there has been a conversation between the Treasury and the Department, and that there has been an agreement on what is an affordable level overall. That helps to give people confidence that they can make their preparations, invest in the supply chain, buy sites and so on. That puts us in a better position than other countries that may embark on that without a good sense of the overall affordability of the policy that they are entering into. We think it is a positive point for investors that we have done it in that way. Secondly, we expect spending on low-carbon generation to increase as we move towards 2020, and that provides a discipline on the Department to think hard about the right mix of generation. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">On your point about network costs, I think the question was: what do we take into account when we consider the appropriate mix of generation at the policy level, rather than the technical LCF level? That is a fair point, and Ministers will take that into account when they are looking at the overall cost and the right mix of generation to meet our 2020 targets. We published in the summer a draft delivery plan for the EMR that set out where Ministers were at that stage, and that has been out for consultation. We are examining that now. We hope to conclude that and publish final plans shortly, and that will be the opportunity to have a debate about why we picked this mix rather than that mix, and what the decision was based on. That is a separate point from the technical control exerted by the LCF, which is done almost for accounting and management of public money reasons.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q11</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Graham Stringer:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I will ask one last question on this subject, if I may; I do not want to exhaust this point totally.

It obscures rather than clarifies that point.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">John Fiennes:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I agree that we can do a better job of bringing together the spend on this, and the NAO is saying that it should be associated with outcomes as well.

You have to bring those together to arrive at the overall effect on bills. We are working very hard to try to set that out clearly. This report says that we could do better, and I think we would agree with that. It has been frustrating that we have not been able to bring the thing together as originally planned, but that is a genuine problem of the quality of information that we put into our accounts, and the conditions that the information has to meet, rather than being a reflection of our desire to get this information out, because we are certainly trying to do that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q12</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Whitehead:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Was not the basis of the LCF, when it was first decided on, that what would be in the LCF would be determined as putative tax and spend by the ONS, and that if something was not defined as putative tax and spend, it would be outside the LCF? The ONS has not yet decided whether a number of projects are putative tax and spend. The Treasury and DECC decided to forecast what the ONS might decide, and placed a number of schemes inside the LCF, on the assumption that the ONS would so designate them. A number of schemes that the ONS has not yet designated may well be in the LCF, such as capacity payments. You appear to dispute that ECO should be in the LCF, but since the original definition of the LCF was that the ONS, not DECC, should decide, it is distinctly possible that ECO would be in the LCF. What meaning does it give to the overall levy control framework if the decision on what is in it is outside the control of DECC or, indeed, the Treasury?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">John Fiennes:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I would like to reiterate a point that I made: the fact that you are outside the LCF does not mean that you are not controlled—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q13</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Whitehead:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I was not asking that question.

The £7.6 billion is where we have got to, between the Department and the Treasury, on the cost of the schemes that are included in what we currently describe as the LCF. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">A thought experiment: if the ONS came back in two years’ time and said that ECO was a levy-funded scheme, and the Government were still using the LCF as defined at the moment, my expectation would be that we would say: “Okay, so now you have more schemes in the LCF”, and the total available for that would change. You may or may not have that as a separate pot in the LCF, as you do with the warm home discount. You could end up with a pot that is warm home discount, which is agreed for a spending </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">review period. You could imagine a pot that is £7.6 billion for low-carbon generation support, in the way that I have described. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">You could have another pot, which is the energy company obligation for however long that lasts at the time and at whatever level it is at the time. It is not that £7.6 billion is fixed and immutable for all time; it would depend on the decisions that are made.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Now, why did we do this at the time? It was because we felt we had to have a level of control over these things as they otherwise would not be controlled, particularly because there is going to be the growth in spending between now and 2020. We have taken what we understand to be a sensible answer based on how ONS classifies things. There is a difference between ECO and things like the CFDs, because with the CFDs the Government is naming a price and we are involved in the cost of that more directly, whereas in ECO you have an obligation on a company to behave in a particular way and they are incentivised to look for the cheapest way of doing that. We are not determining the best way of doing that and we hope that they are competing with each other, in effect, to do keener deals on ECO and therefore get competitive advantage. There is a difference in nature between the two schemes that to us justifies the difference in treatment. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">If it changed in the future—if ECO was included in the LCF and you had a larger total, maybe with a ring-fenced pot for ECO—how much difference would that make? I think ECO would still be a matter of intense debate. You would still have the argument about what size it should be. I don’t think that would change very much from what we are seeing at the moment. So to me, it would be a technical accounting change—an amending public money change—but not something that would necessarily change the underlying reality of the policy.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q14</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Whitehead:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> That is, one might say, so you hope, rather than automaticity, isn’t it? If ONS decides that ECO is within the levy control framework, in as much as it is classified as putative tax and spend, the expectation might be that the levy control framework would alter in terms of its 2020 figures to exactly accommodate the estimated cost of ECO over the period at present. But that is not guaranteed, is it? That is a different method of calculating the total—that is, it is a Treasury issue, not a DECC issue. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">John Fiennes:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We have agreed between DECC and the Treasury what the scope for spending is on the low-carbon generation—the number I have given.

So there is no reason to think that because the ONS changes the accounting treatment of it, that would open up that discussion. That does not mean that in future, Government could not take a different view of what the right answers on those elements are, but there is no logic to the supposition that because the ONS changes its view, the rest of it should change.

That, to me, says that you need to have your technical answer for how you are controlling those levies, but you need to bring it together in a way that is visible to people so that they can see the gross effect and the net effect of all these things coming together on bills and how they are going to change. That is what you need to have a debate about whether it is sensible and whether we have got the right mix here.

The first is the fact of the envelope having been agreed, which we think is a significant element. The second thing is, when we designed the policy instruments, we designed them in a way that provides confidence that they will be honoured in future. The contract for difference, in particular, is being structured as a contract on which people can rely and in which they have confidence. We think that means that they will be positive about it. The third thing is the way in which the Government behaves in this area and its preparedness to honour the commitments that it has made, so that even if we hit a sticky patch, as we did on the small-scale feed-in tariff, we have not sought to retrospectively undermine the deals that people have done. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I think all those things come together to be a good offer for investors, and we think people are responding to that; we certainly hope they are.

For the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">renewables</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> obligation, it is to do with the number of renewable obligation certificates that get redeemed.

On FITs, they publish quarterly reporting. Each scheme has an annual report, and between times we use our forecasting models and our market intelligence to sense-check where we think we are in terms of progress. For example, for the warm home discount, when we set the obligation that it set, the issue is how accurate the Department for Work and Pensions forecast of eligible pensioner population is. Quite quickly within an obligation year, we will understand that. In some schemes, you do not need to be monitoring day by day what is occurring. On FITs, we can have much more regular monitoring. RO, again, is in a slightly different time frame, so until we understand how many certificates are being put forward, we will not be clear between the use of the buy-out fund and certificates.

The payments made under the contract for difference will depend on the level of the wholesale price, because it tops up to the strike price. There will be new sources of information, particularly the counterparty body, which is allocating the contracts and monitoring the spend, and National Grid, which is helping to understand what the pipeline may look like. One of the things that the NAO have rightly said in their report is that as we design our systems for this regime, which should start from the end of next year, we need to make sure that we are anticipating the information </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">demands that we are going to be facing and making sure that we have the best possible information to monitor that as it goes through. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There are things that the Department can do to be prudent here.

I think it is a settlement with which we are comfortable. There is a lot of investment to do before 2020 to meet the targets, but we think the signs are encouraging so far. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q23</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Whitehead:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You mentioned the transition between RO and CFDs, and the increased complexity that that will introduce. Indeed, it will produce an enormous amount of increased complexity, will it not, because ROs are more or less predictable, whereas CFDs are more or less unpredictable, in terms of the relationship between the strike price and the reference price in any particular period? That will make a difference to how much of your cumulative reward for projects already in the system will have to be allocated to an inherently variable amount of money that you will put out for those projects under the levy control framework. You have mentioned that you might have a contingency for that purpose within the LCF. Is that right? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">John Fiennes:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> There are two things I would say in response to that. First, in the period of the parallel running of the RO and the CFD, how will people see them? We have been working very hard to try to ensure that we set strike prices for the CFD in a way that we think provides equivalent support, and we will shortly set out where we have got to on that, after the consultation. My sense is that there are signs that generators do not see it quite in the way that you have been describing. If I am a low-carbon generator with a high capital cost, this certainty in my future cash flows is incredibly important. As to how those are comprised, they do not much mind. The thing about the RO is that you are taking a wholesale price risk.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q24</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Whitehead:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I am not particularly concerned about the generators, because in a sense, with the combination of the strike price and the reference price, they will get a known amount; that is supposedly what the CFD does. However, with regard to the LCF, there is an inherently uncertain element of expenditure relating to whatever the difference between the strike price and the reference price may turn out to be, as far as your financial planning is concerned.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">John Fiennes:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The response to that is that there is some uncertainty, but the project has to choose one or the other. Whether we are talking about a top-up payment, under the RO, to what we think the right level is, or a top-up payment under the CFD, we would expect the payments to be quite similar. It is one of those balloons: if you push it down on one side, it goes up on the other. I do not think that there is an unmanageable risk there. The risk would be that if we were very significantly off in our wholesale price projections, the CFD would look higher than the RO payments would be for the same plant. The period of double running is quite soon, and we have a reasonable sense of what wholesale prices will be. We believe that that is manageable.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">From the point of view of the energy bill payer, if it were decided that CFD suits them better and they go that way, that would probably be a good thing, because we think that that will reduce the net present value of the support necessary to get the projects away, as we have a lower cost-to-capital ratio through the CFD than through the RO. It is not something that we worry about a lot, but it is a real issue that we have to keep an eye on.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q25</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Whitehead:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes, but you mentioned that you have in mind a contingency for dealing with how the wholesale market varies according to the strike price.

We do not think that people should be worried, from that point of view. If our forecasts turn out to be completely wrong, the Government will need to think at the time what they wish to do about that.

That is a fair point and we will do our best to do that. I hope the delivery plan will provide an opportunity and I will certainly take away that particular point and look at it, so when we do the delivery plan we try to make sure that it is as clear as possible. It is an important point, as you say, for investors and for confidence, but we believe that the policy we have and the financial provision we have is a good offer and is the right one.

One can have a debate about what are the right assumptions to make about savings, but we certainly need to be including those in the policy debate. That is not to say that you should not look carefully at all these policies, to make sure that you have the right level and the right element on bills as opposed to in other respects.

We think that in 2020, the poorest 30% of households will spend on average 1% to 2.5% less of their expenditure on energy than they would in the absence of policy. A lot of work is going on to provide people with help and support where we can. The energy company obligation has elements for that, including the warm home discount and the winter fuel payment. A lot of money is being spent by Public Health </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> to address public health priorities, including excess winter deaths. We have an initiative run from the Department in which volunteers are trained to help vulnerable people use the energy saving network to get the best deal for them, and to provide them with support. Absolutely, this is an important issue that we take into account. The key is to provide people with the right support to get into the right tariff, to help them with energy efficiency, and to do the best that we can in that way.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Neil Bush:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Again, we can provide that to the Committee, because the prices and bills report breaks down the impact on consumer bills by income </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">decile</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q48</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Whitehead:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The Treasury proposes that levy-funded schemes be excluded from the next parliamentary estimates and end-year accounts.

Where we have come unstuck with these imputed tax and spend schemes is that the income, or the revenue, does not meet international accounting standard 18, which deals with revenue recognition. The Comptroller and Auditor General has said that if we had included the notional income from these schemes in our accounts, we would have prepared our accounts outside the international financial reporting standards and he would have—rightly, given his duties—qualified the Department.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We have spent two years trying to find a way around this issue in a way that is consistent with the principles of clear line of sight and the IFRS.

We want that to be collaborative. It would not be right for us to say, “This is what we think. Here is the process.” I am sure that you would rightly criticise us if we did that.
