We are not proposing that extractive industries be excused or exempted from adhering to these standards, but that time is allowed to improve governance standards within operations located in these frontier markets. This way the cost to extractive companies can be incurred over time, and a balance is struck between expense, delivering returns to shareholders and improving governance standards.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ENRC will assist the committee as much as it can with its inquiries and is particularly keen to engage in dialogue on areas within the committee's ambit, such as to how the current UK business environment might be improved.  However, as the committee will know, the company is presently the subject of a formal SFO criminal investigation and involved in other, civil, proceedings. In the circumstances, there are certain factual areas of legal sensitivity, in particular relating to historic compliance / conduct issues, which necessarily limit the scope of information the company and its representatives can provide the committee. While some of these issues have been the subject of unfortunate press speculation, they ought not to be of central relevance to the inquiry. The company will be grateful to the committee for respecting its position in this regard.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">27 September 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:right"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
