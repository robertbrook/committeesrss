They certainly should have been; they were somewhere within the </span><span style="font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:15pt">organisation</span><span style="font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:15pt">, and we have investigated why they did not come out until much later in the day, as have other </span><span style="font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:15pt">organisations</span><span style="font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:15pt">. I think that was covered by the judge when Network Rail was sentenced. I think it was also covered in the ORR investigation." </span><span style="font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:15pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size:15pt">TSC evidence 4 November 2013 </span><span style="font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT;

font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt"> We met David Higgins shortly after the missing documents appeared in 2011.</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt"> He assured us that everything Network Rail had would be given to us, and I believe he did.</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt"> But as I say, we were never told of any internal inquiry.</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt"> Either we were yet again fobbed off, or Network Rail never did carry out an inquiry</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt"> - I suspect the latter.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt 12pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">The second part of that quote relates to the fact that the judge for some reason announced that there was no suggestion of a cover-up – yet no-one has ever carried out an investigation on whether there was a cover-up or not.</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt"> ORR certainly did not – their role was to investigate the breaches of Health and Safety legislation within Network Rail and they have told me they were unable to get any answers other than ‘don’t know’ from the people they questioned about what went wrong.</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt"> They certainly did not exonerate Network Rail.</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt"> The “other </span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">organisations</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">” </span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">Gisby</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt"> referred to are RSSB and RAIB – neither of these investigated why the documents had not appeared.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt 12pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">Gisby</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">, of course, has been Head of Operations at Network Rail from before the accident at </span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">Elsenham</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt"> until now, and therefore - ultimately - the officer responsible for any failings.</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt"> If he did not know what went on, then his performance as a manager must be brought into question.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt 12pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">I do not wish to be vindictive about this but it seems that he and other people at Network Rail have not taken the responsibility they should.</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt"> Another senior person who has failed, I believe, is Richard Smith, Network Rail’s solicitor.</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt"> From documents provided by ORR under Freedom of Information we know that he had possession of the </span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">Hudd</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt"> Memo in February 2011 at the latest (we believe he probably knew back in 2006) but it did not ‘appear’ until March 2011 when it was eventually handed to David Higgins who passed it on to us.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt 12pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">I do exclude David Higgins from any responsibility – of course, he was not there until 2011 and the matter only became public in the week he arrived at Network Rail.</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt"> And without his support I suspect Network Rail would have put up a fight.</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt"> As it was, he insisted that the organization was guilty – he made this known to staff, some of whom in 2012 were saying that Network Rail had only pleaded guilty for ‘political’ and ‘PR’ reasons.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt 12pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">I appreciate that there is a lot of minutiae in all this but unfortunately, some of the devil is in the detail in our case.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt 12pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">For me, this is an issue of accountability – no one has so far taken responsibility.</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt"> The response seems to be merely a shrug of the shoulders.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt 12pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">I do hope the committee in its report will make some reference to this.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt 12pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">November 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
