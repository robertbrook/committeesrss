There is also a risk that this will lead to repeat homelessness with households’ housing benefit being restricted and them therefore being unable to meet their rental obligations This will present particular problems in Scotland where the abolition of ‘priority need’ means that there are a greater number of single person households being accepted as homeless and therefore placed in TA. There is a limited amount of 1 bedroom social houses available so single people are likely to be placed in households larger than their needs and so will be subject to the under occupancy restrictions. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">7.3 Recommendations</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">TA should be exempt from both the benefit cap and the under occupancy criteria so that councils are able to carry out their statutory duties </span></li></ul><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Under UC, the government must ensure that the specific purpose of TA to alleviate homelessness is considered and a funding mechanism developed which allows councils to fulfil their statutory duties</span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">8.

However, there are problems with the specific definition that the DWP uses to decide what accommodation will be exempt. Much of the accommodation which is considered supported does not meet this definition, so people living in it could potentially find that they are subject to housing benefit restrictions including the benefit cap or the ‘bedroom tax’. This is not the government’s stated intention and they are seeking to draft a new definition, but progress on this has so far been limited. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">8.2 </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Recommendation</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The government must urgently develop a new definition in consultation with key stakeholders which encompasses all supported accommodation.</span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-indent:18pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">9.
