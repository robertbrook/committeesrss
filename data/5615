What I hoped to achieve was a loosening of relations, or a warming up of relations with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> after a period when they had been in cold storage. As colleagues will know, I have taken a long-standing interest in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> going back to the first few months when I was Foreign Secretary, and I visited it five times when I was Foreign Secretary. I did my best, with my colleagues, initially Dominique de </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Villepin</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Joschka</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Fischer, to achieve agreement with the Iranians on the nuclear dossier. We got quite close to it, but were frustrated in what we could achieve because of resistance by essentially the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">neocons</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in the Bush Administration. I kept warning them that that would lead to a situation where the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Khatami</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Administration were undermined to the point where they would lose office, and indeed that happened, and they begat the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Ahmadinejad</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> regime for eight years. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">With the election of President </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Rouhani</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in June last year, and his assumption of office in early August, we all thought that there was an opportunity. There were quite long negotiations about going to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Tehran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, but they came off and we went there in early January.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Lamont:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> May I first draw attention to my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests?

I saw it as a natural follow-on to the fact that the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Geneva</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> negotiations had begun and the fact that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Britain</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is exploring better relations and reopening the embassy. It seemed natural. I have had an interest in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> for a decade of so.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr Wallace:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I was the last British MP to visit in 2008, and I wanted to go and see what had changed, and I think there were four things. I wanted to know whether there was a real attempt, behind the words, to resolve the issues with the 5+1 and the greater issues. I wanted to get a sense of how strong the President was in his own position to be able to deliver, because it is not just about whether they can make a deal, but whether a deal can be delivered. I wanted to see whether there was any opposition, because it is quite a pluralistic society. Finally, we went to look at the embassy to see whether there was a pressing need for the reopening of diplomatic ties at a practical level as well as at a policy level. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jeremy </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Corbyn</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It was an extremely interesting visit. My view was that it was important to engage with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, to hope that there will be a reopening of full diplomatic relations with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and hope that nuclear talks will succeed to a good conclusion within six months and that the sanctions will ultimately be lifted. I also wanted the opportunity to engage with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> because of the great deal of history between this country and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, most of it not very good, but also to raise issues of human rights and the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">diaspora</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—there are a very large number of Iranian people living in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Britain</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.

However, I think we have helped to open the way for future visits and future delegations, and hopefully an inward delegation from </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> to this country, so that we build a constructive dialogue that can engage with all of those issues. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q83 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Lord Lamont, can you </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">clarify</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> one thing?

It was a bit like being ushered in; we were asked to go for a press conference and turned the corner, and there was a huge barrage of all the journalists. But mainly the questions came from the state media.

To what extent do you think the Foreign Office has a good understanding of the situation in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">? We have the linguistic expertise, the area expertise, the direct contact with the Iranian population.

But sometimes the Foreign Office Iran desk was manned by people who spent lots of time in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and were incredibly up on it and educated and sometimes it was not. So it has been intermittent.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Maybe it goes to a bigger question that is more for this Committee than me, about the extent to which we formulate our policy wider than single issues. So if it is very focused on the nuclear issue, Iran has experience of single issues being solved and then the State Department or the Foreign Office moving on as if it was on to another issue, as if it did not matter. Iranian assistance to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Britain</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">America</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Afghanistan</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> war was rewarded by saying, “You are part of the axis for evil”. So the Iranians sort of say, “Hang on, we tried to take measures to build steps and then the Foreign Office has just moved on to something else.” I wonder if it is a wider issue.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I would say that, if you have been a diplomat in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, it is easy to get some element of bunker mentality, because the Iranian Governments of the past have indulged in intimidation and making life harder for the official </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">diaspora</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> of all the diplomats, not just British. It is easy to get into the “them and us” scenario. Does that therefore lead to lack of trust? Yes, it clearly does. And, secondly, does it sometimes close down giving people the benefit of the doubt or thinking a new angle? That has been some of the problem in the past. We had a meeting with William Hague after we went and I think the Foreign Secretary is keen to give it a new go, as is the State Department.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Lamont:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think it is a difficult question to answer, because obviously the Foreign Office has one resource that we do not have—Jack had it in his time—which is access to intelligence about Iran and what is happening in certain areas. Having said that, I think the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Foreign Office is influenced, understandably, but perhaps we have to get over it, by the attack on the embassy. I can understand the hesitation. But that has put the iron into the soul of the Foreign Office.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I think our policy is very influenced by the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. In my experience, the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> does not have a good understanding, and sometimes it has no understanding, of the light and dark, or the shade—it is not all black and white—of political currents in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. I remember an American diplomat once coming to the equivalent of this Committee in the House of Lords.

Are there constructive policy changes that we could introduce, institutionally, in order to make the Foreign Office better able to provide reliable and consistent strategic advice on </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr Straw:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I do not know that there will be structural changes. There is still a cadre of Farsi-speakers with experience in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Tehran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. As Mr Wallace has said, some have understandably been adversely affected by their experience in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Tehran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. By turns, pre-</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Khatami</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, at times during the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Khatami</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> period and certainly during the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Ahmadinejad</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> period, life was very difficult for our diplomats, not only UK-based diplomats but particularly that large proportion of people working for the British embassy in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Tehran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> who were locally engaged. I would also like to say that there are people who had quite a difficult time in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Tehran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> who none the less are advocates of restoring relations as quickly as possible.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">May I could spend a moment on something?

There are three sets of buildings. There is a visa office in one corner, separate from the others—separate access. It looks trashed, as if there has been a bad burglary, but not damaged by fire or anything. It would not take long to put that right. The residence itself is actually in quite good condition—there was very little evidence of people going through it, apart from slogans on the wall, written in English, which said, “Down with the English.” Since Lord Lamont and Mr Wallace had been ahead of me and were around the corner, I rather fancied that they had probably written the slogans and worked out the Farsi as well.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Lamont:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We are Anglo-Scottish.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr Straw:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We are used to such abuse from our northern colleagues. The ground floor of the chancery building was used for consular stuff, and that was damaged by fire. We did not go upstairs, but it had been locked off. The demonstrators could not get up there, although they got up a staircase. It was not disturbed, because they could not gain access, but there is fire damage. My judgment, which I think is our judgment, although my colleagues can speak for themselves, is that physically these buildings can be put right pretty quickly. The issue is whether there will be sufficient assurances about the safety and security of our embassy compounds and staff to allow a resumption of full diplomatic relations.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In the end, we simply have to trust the undertakings that are given.

I do not think there were parliamentary delegations going out there in parallel with my visits, but for a Foreign Minister to visit a country like Iran five times was giving it a lot of attention, and that was accepted. Of course—going back to Mr Stewart’s question—that meant that the whole of the Foreign Office was giving it attention too. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I was still in office when President </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Ahmadinejad</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> was elected in June 2005, and then things became difficult because they were just in a different place.

Well, more on one or two details. For example, Jeremy mentioned the concession of sanctions relief for certain humanitarian goods such as medicines and, on the other hand, we have the banking boycott. This is completely ineffective as you can have access to drugs but are denied the means to pay for them. There is a particular clause in the provisional agreement that says that each country should have a nominated bank to finance these humanitarian transactions and the British Government has not nominated such a bank.

American unilateral sanctions would basically say to BP, Shell or anyone else, “You can fill up that Iranian aeroplane, but you do that and you will not be trading in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">America</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.” Such third-party or extraterritorial bullying meant that, for example, the all-party group’s bank account was cancelled by HSBC because it had the word “</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">” in it—for no other reason.

If the talks on nuclear processing are successful and Iran is a member of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, that would lead to the possibility of opening the Finnish conference on a nuclear weapons-free zone, or a weapons of mass destruction-free zone, in the Middle East. I also noticed—I made a particular note of this—that when we had a very long meeting with the Foreign Minister he said quite specifically that in questions on human rights, he was prepared to engage in an EU-Iran human rights dialogue on the lifting of sanctions. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Those are issues that can be taken up, and there are issues of journalists’ freedom and so on, but we do not gain any traction if we just join in the general right-wing position that some Americans have of complete isolation of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.

As Mr Wallace said, everything goes back, at the moment, to the P5 plus 1 negotiations. Sanctions have unquestionably been damaging to the Iranian economy. One of the Ministers we spoke to described them as crippling. Others suggested that about half of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’s economic problems were attributable to heroic economic mismanagement by the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Ahmadinejad</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> regime, and the other half to sanctions. If we are a member of the P5, we have additional responsibilities beyond the fact that we are a medium-sized western country because we are member of the P5. It is therefore incumbent on us to make extra effort, even at some risk, to get diplomatic relations back, so we can develop better understanding and better communications.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I would just add this point. Part of the Iranian narrative about themselves and their history portrays the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United Kingdom</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> as a villain of the piece for at least a century and a half. As Mr Wallace has said, they have actually rather good reasons for thinking that for a long period. It will take time to break that down, but you will not break it down at all unless we have better relations. Obviously trade is one important form of relations. Cultural relations, thanks not least to the work of the British Museum and the National Museum of Iran, continued notwithstanding other difficulties during the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Ahmadinejad</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> regime.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There is tourism. It is an extraordinarily rich tourist destination. One of the Iranian newspapers proclaimed the fact that they were now in the top 20 worldwide tourist destinations. While we have been in a process of searching for isolation of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, the rest of the world goes on. Trade with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">China</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has increased 15-fold. The Indians, essentially, never really bothered about sanctions. Even parts of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> economy have managed, one way or another, to accommodate them.

It says something for Dr </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Rouhani’s</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> instinct for survival in what has been a very tricky situation that he managed to get through the vetting of the Guardian Council.

That is self-evidently not the case. Who knows why they came to that view? One suggestion is that the Supreme Leader and the gentleman running the Guardian Council, who has been there since the revolution—he has been there for 30 years—have judged that the hard-line agenda of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Ahmadinejad</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">s</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Mohammad </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Rahimi</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">s</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> of this world had run out and was not working and that they needed to see whether the Iranian people supported an alternative.

There is a big and tumultuous political space in which, to a degree that varies over time, a level of consent is achieved. If you read the US Library of Congress research paper on </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, there is a striking point on the stability of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’s institutions, particularly in comparison with the institutions of the countries that surround it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Lamont:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Iranian elections have been described as </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">unfree</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, undemocratic and unpredictable. The election was, as you say, between vetted candidates, but it was quite fierce and extremely competitive. As Mr Straw says, it looked as if people were not going to participate in the election and that there would be a very low turnout. At one point they were proposing not to have the televised debates, but they did have them. I have seen quite a few of those debates—I watched some of them at the time—and they were extremely vigorous. The candidates were quite rude to one another other and had different views about the nuclear negotiations and relations with the west. What comes out of this is that although the overall political set-up in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is authoritarian and at times repressive, public opinion matters. Once in four years, public opinion expresses its view. You will notice that when </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Rouhani</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> appears he always uses the phrase, “It wasn’t me who brought about this change in atmosphere; it was public opinion.” </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Does </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Rouhani</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> have the ability to deliver? I think it is a good thing that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Rouhani</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is a man of the regime, rather than a complete outsider—if he had been a complete outsider, he probably wouldn’t have been allowed to stand. The fact that he has held so many different offices and been at the centre of the regime in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> gives him a greater capability to deliver. He does appear to be trusted by the supreme leader, Mr </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Khamenei</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, who has reluctantly allowed the negotiations to proceed, while simultaneously saying that he doesn’t think they will succeed in the end. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jeremy </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Corbyn</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It is not a constitution that we would design</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">around this table. Certainly, the idea of vetting candidates before they are nominated seems pretty strange to us, so it is quite difficult to understand some of the structures of the constitution. However, there are clearly balances within it, and there is also a kind of elected process—the Guardian Council. The Parliament also has considerable power to hold Ministers to account, suspend them from office, pass motions of censure and things such as that, so there is a functioning form of accountability. Whether that will lead to an opening up of civil society, with trade unions and everything else—one hopes it will. Certainly, since </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Rouhani</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> became President there have been considerable changes in that area, but there is a long way to go. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr Wallace:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I don’t know, I have never met President </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Rouhani</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, but I think we are at a good place. The </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Geneva</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> accord puts us in a place where we judge each other by our actions. I think that President </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Rouhani’s</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> statements since he was elected are certainly an amazing change from previous Presidents. Just saying those things in the past would have been controversial. To that extent, he has broken the mould by commenting on how women dress, freedom of the media, etc. What we have to see is whether there are actions behind that. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Geneva</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> accord is the best way for both sides to prove themselves.

The west broke its word on this, this and this.” That is why the accord is so important. It is about saying that we have a past, but we have got to talk about the future.

We had a similar choice back in 2005, when the Iranians had fewer than 200 centrifuges. The opportunity was blown essentially by opposition from the neo-cons on the right of the US Administration, which prevented there being a deal. Although there were increasing sanctions against </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> at the time, roll forward nine years and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> now has 18,800 working centrifuges.

As you know, Mr Baron, by the constitution, the Supreme Leader is the final arbiter, but he works in a highly political space. One of the interesting things about our visit to the presidential compound is that it is next door to where the Supreme Leader lives. We were told—Mr Wallace asked about this—that there is almost daily contact between the two. So it is not as though he is sitting above the battle in the way that the constitutional monarch is in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United Kingdom</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">You have the Revolutionary Guards, and it is important to bear in mind that the Revolutionary Guards are also an economic force. You have these semi-state economic organisations which are around and about the Revolutionary Guards. Then you have the Parliament, as Mr Wallace has described. It is independent in its own way but is significantly controlled by the Council of Guardians. There is a very high turnover of MPs at each election, not least because the Council of Guardians decides whether sitting MPs can stand again. So they have always got to have—I mean, if you can imagine in the British system—an eye on whether you are going to be here after an election, and whether you get approved by a sort of people’s committee, as it were.

Well, perhaps </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Rouhani</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is not a reformer. He has occupied many different posts in the armed forces and in the National Security Council. He knows the regime inside out. The </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Majlis</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, as Mr Straw has said, is where there is a degree of hostility.

The relationship of the Revolutionary Guards is to Mr </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Khamenei</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, the Supreme Leader. Incidentally, I do not want to down play them, but I think it is not necessarily right to think of the Revolutionary Guards as a uniform organisation with a uniform view. In 2009, at the time of the Green revolution, there were allegedly arguments between the different commanders as to the correct way in which to respond. I sometimes think that when people cannot comprehend the Iranian set up, they just start talking about the Revolutionary Guards as some mysterious organisation. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jeremy </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Corbyn</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We got plenty of discussion about the history of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Britain</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’s relations with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, particularly from some Members of the Parliament, which was interesting.

Before I do so—I have been handed a note—I must declare an interest in that I am a member of the all-party group on Iran, as you know, and I lived in Iran for a year before the revolution, back in 1978-79. Although you will not get a Foreign Minister to admit it publicly, mistakes have been made by the West in this relationship, but mistakes have been made by both sides. You alluded to them yourself, Mr Straw: </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Mosaddegh</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, supporting </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iraq</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, axis of evil speeches and so forth. To what extent do you think the West has learned from those mistakes—as I say, mistakes have been made by Iran as well—and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">to what extent is that answer dependent on a change of attitude in the US?

There is no other way to do it. Among many in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> foreign policy system, there is a growing appreciation of the mistakes that have been made and an increasing sophistication of analysis about </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.

There is of course a big and vibrant Iranian </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">diaspora</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What worries me, at the same time, is that there is an agenda by the right-wing in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, typified by </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Netanyahu</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and those to the right of him in the very fractious coalition he leads, and those in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, with the axis being the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">American Israel Public Affairs Committee</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.

I think that for a long time there has been a pervasive vulgarity to part of the narrative of American foreign policy. It requires there to be a demon. For a long time, the obvious demon was the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Soviet Union</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, and that suited everybody. That collapsed and we have moved on to other demons. They need a demon. It is not about foreign policy analysis; they have a psycho-political need. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is that demon. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The parody of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> that comes across the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Atlantic</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is extraordinary in my view. I am sure my colleagues would say this. When I started going to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, which seemed like a perfectly normal place to go to because I knew it, people thought I was going to the Moon or something. It was absolutely amazing. In fact </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Tehran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> feels like </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Madrid</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> or </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Athens</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> rather than </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Cairo</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> or Mumbai.

There are plenty of really sophisticated people with a good understanding and others who have no understanding and, bluntly, don’t want one either.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lord Lamont:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think both </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Saudi Arabia</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, and it is convenient for them, want to keep </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> as a country that is beyond the pale. They would face a challenge if there was any normalisation of relations and then there would be another power in the area with some influence on the West. What </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> really wants in its foreign policy is to have structures relating to the Middle East in which </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is recognised and can play a role in regional affairs. After the end of the Iran-Iraq war there was a UN resolution—I forget the number—which advocated that a body should be set up in which all the different countries of the region would be represented under an independent chairman to discuss the issues of the region that were of mutual interest.

We should be careful in the British Government that we not being pushed around or influenced by some of those vested interests for the wrong reasons. There are economic rivals; there are religious rivals; there are cultural rivals in that region whose enmity goes back a very long way. We should be clear about that. We should also recognise the role rhetoric plays in most </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Middle East</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> politics. There are two interesting facts that have never occurred to people, despite the rhetoric. Number one: it was literally by a show of hands that the Iranians chose to invade the American embassy rather than the Russian embassy in 1980—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">whatever year it was. That is because </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Russia</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> was historically even more of an enemy to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> than the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and so we could have been in a very different place if that show of hands had gone the other way. Secondly, despite the rhetoric of Ayatollah Khomeini in the ’80s and the strong rhetoric that we should liberate </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Jerusalem</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and so on, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’s closest ally in the early 1980s, the receiver of most of their weapons, was </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> armed </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> throughout the whole Iran-Iraq war. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has a very old relationship with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and understands them.

The first question is directed at you, Mr Straw. Not so long ago, going back two years, there was all sorts of concern following the IAEA report about </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’s nuclear ambitions. There was lots of sabre rattling here from various quarters. Given that most of the evidence was circumstantial and not hard evidence, and given your time leading up to the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iraq</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> war where you saw things from the inside, do you see any parallels with that period that concern you? If so, what are the lessons we should learn if any?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr Straw:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> There are not any direct parallels. There is certainly an overwhelming lesson about the need to be highly sceptical about intelligence. The issue with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iraq</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> was not that there was any ambiguity about what </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iraq</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> had had by way of chemical and biological weapons programmes. That was incontrovertible. The issue was whether they still had them. The issue with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> involves many fewer certainties. It is speculation as to whether they have had a nuclear weapons ambition and programme and whether they still have. That was why I took such a strong stand when I was Foreign Secretary against any idea that the United Kingdom should engage in military action against Iran, which caused a bit of a problem inside the Government; but the idea that on speculation fanned by people like the National Council of Resistance of Iran, who are </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">parti</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">pris</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, and, as I say, attached to a terrorist organisation, we should engage in some kind of jihad against Iran, seemed to me to be inconceivable.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In terms of the Iranian hierarchy, the Iranians’ problem is that they have not been straight with the IAEA. On that there is no doubt. They may have good reasons, from their point of view, for that. They are not very good reasons from the point of view of the IAEA. Certainly, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Ahmadinejad’s</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> extraordinary achievement was to so alienate the whole of the rest of the international community that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> was placed before the Security Council, because of a lack of disclosure. Do I personally believe that there is any evidence to suggest they have got a nuclear weapons programme? No. I think the best indication of that is the national intelligence estimate of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in 2007, which judged that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> had stopped its active nuclear weapons programme in 2003.

This is a complicated dossier, and there will be problems—there are bound to be with different interests involved. It boils down to whether both sides want a long-term deal.

It has got to have the additional protocol, plus annex 3(1) as well, which would give those rights to inspections elsewhere.

May I welcome you, Mr Fitzpatrick, and apologise for the fact you had to wait? I hope you agree that we have just had a very interesting session. Is there something you would like to say by way of opening remarks?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mark Fitzpatrick:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes, Mr Chairman. I thought I would speak for a couple of minutes about my impressions of the joint plan of action that was being discussed towards the end of that previous session. I am positive for the short term. Under the joint plan of action, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’s nuclear capabilities are capped. The time to produce a weapons-worth of highly enriched uranium will double instead of being halved by next December as had been projected. The threat of war has been put off. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’s pragmatic new President delivered on his promise to start </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">dialling</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> back sanctions, and his negotiators made most of the compromises. Neither side has any incentive to cheat.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The wind has come out of the sails of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Congressional push to adopt new sanctions, which would scuttle diplomacy in my view. There is growing recognition that to be politically viable, any final deal would have to allow some degree of enrichment on </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’s soil. But I am pessimistic about the long term. The two sides are simply too far apart in their demands for what a comprehensive deal must entail. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The west wants deep cutbacks, elimination of the vast majority of the centrifuges and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Fordow</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Arak</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> facilities and for the period of limitations to last up to 20 years. It also wants clarity concerning the evidence of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’s past weapons development work. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> does not want to dismantle anything or to give up its capability to be able to produce nuclear weapons. It is willing to make tactical adjustments, but it seeks limits that last only a short time. In exchange, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> wants all sanctions lifted.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There are technical solutions, as Lord Lamont mentioned. Rather than being </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">dumbed</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> down, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Arak</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> can be upgraded to a light-water reactor with conditions that make it proliferation-resistant. The time frame for the limitations can be left up to the IAEA to apply neutral objective criteria. If </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> accepts and fully implements the additional protocol, after a few years the IAEA could draw up conclusions about no undeclared nuclear activity.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Whether the solutions are politically acceptable to the key capitals, however, I doubt. My best guess is that the negotiators will not produce a comprehensive agreement and that at the end of the six months the interim period will be rolled over, probably with some further incremental limits to both the nuclear programme and to sanctions. Whether it can be rolled over for more than another six months is too early to tell, especially in the light of the mid-term US elections in November.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q119 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Thank you very much indeed, Mr Fitzpatrick.

There is a kind of consensus way that decisions are made in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. Ultimately, of course, the Supreme Leader has the say and nothing will happen of this importance without his agreement, but he alone cannot make a decision that is contrary to the views of the others in what is sometimes called the elite. So there are various circles of power and a kind of consensus.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Who is in charge of the nuclear programme? On the one hand it is the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, led by an ally of the President, but I do not think that they are in charge of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">weaponisation</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> work of which there has been evidence in the past.

Parts of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps are doing very well under the current sanctions regime: they reap the black market profits from the sanctions when private businesses cannot compete. I think, just for pure commercial reasons, they might oppose the deal, but they might also oppose it because they do not like the west—the United Kingdom and the United States—and they do not want to do business with us. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q122 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Last year, you told us that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> was capable of producing enough fissile material to make a nuclear bomb within months.

Setting up the line might take a few weeks and then actually doing it might only take a couple of weeks. Could it be done in secret? The activity could probably be done in secret, but probably not, because the material itself is safeguarded.

They have already been continuing all their nuclear work with no negotiations, so having negotiations doesn’t give them any additional benefit: in fact, it caps their programme. They are probably the ones who are more in a hurry to get a final deal, even though they do not talk that way. They talk as though it is, “Oh well, maybe let the West be the ones”, but they have an incentive. The West probably has an incentive to keep it capped. If there is not a comprehensive deal struck in the next six months, it is probably to western capitals’ benefit to roll this over to keep the lid on the programme.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q139 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> From what you were saying a moment ago, you seemed to acknowledge that the sanctions are working—they have had an impact—in negotiating terms. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mark Fitzpatrick:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes, that is my belief.
