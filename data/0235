font-size:11pt">longer using any of this expertise – their work seemed to be restricted recovery and preparation of samples at the bench.  A number of them were being re-trained to carry out footwear mark comparisons.  If this is, indeed, the case, then this represents an enormous waste of talent.</span></h2><h1 style="font-size:11pt;
