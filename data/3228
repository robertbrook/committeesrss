The argument that the residence test is unlawful, whether under the ECHR, EU or common law, is based on the principle of equality or non-discrimination. Everyone is equal before the law, and must be able to enforce their legal rights in court. The possibility of giving such persons exceptional funding for particularly hard cases does not provide them with equality before the law. It simply mitigates, slightly, the degree of inequality.

So where the merits test is met, legal aid will be available for a judicial review claim to remedy any errors. Thus, LASPO is structured so that an important safeguard against poor decision making under section 10 is provided. That will allow (a) individuals to correct wrong decisions, and (b) puts a strong upward pressure on the quality of decision making by the Legal Aid Agency (“LAA”). </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; text-decoration:underline">The relationship between the residence test and section 10</span></p><ol start="11" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 11pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">If a residence test is introduced, the above safeguards will not operate in the same way. </span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 11pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The residence test will be introduced by amendment of Schedule 1.

The problem is that section 9 of LASPO confers power to make legal aid available for certain types of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">legal services</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, by adding or removing services from Part 1 of Schedule 1. It does not, on the face of it, allow the availability of legal aid to be governed by a characteristic of the person who is applying for legal aid. The language of the statute does not seem to me to contemplate this, and there are no purposive considerations that suggest that it should be read to allow this. On the contrary, the fact that restricting legal aid by reference to the applicant’s characteristics is necessarily discriminatory, and will have  implications for the enforcement of fundamental rights at common law and under the ECHR, points strongly against such a reading of the statute</span><a name="_ftnref3"></a><a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. </span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 11pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The structural problem which I have set out above strongly reinforces this concern. It shows that a restriction based on residence necessarily works in a different way from a restriction based on subject matter. A residence test infects, not merely the original application for legal aid, but </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">every subsequent application, including where legal aid is sought to challenge a refusal of legal aid under LASPO itself. It is very difficult to believe that Parliament had this in contemplation when it enacted sections 9 and 10 of LASPO. I would be surprised if the courts upheld a residence test introduced in secondary legislation made under LASPO. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; text-decoration:underline">The LAA as gatekeeper</span></p><ol start="22" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 11pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">A further problem arises from the fact that the LAA, an executive agency within the Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”), is the “gatekeeper” for the grant of funding under section 10. In cases involving private law, to which the government is not a party, that is perhaps not problematic. At present, judicial review is within part 1 of Schedule 1, and hence the LAA is not called upon to make decisions whether to grant legal aid for potentially controversial claims against the government under section 10. If a residence test is introduced, that will change. The LAA, a central government body overseen by a member of the Cabinet, will make decisions on whether to fund claims which may be highly inconvenient to other government departments or the MOJ itself. In the extreme case, outlined above, where funding is sought to challenge its own determinations on residence or section 10 itself, it will be in a position to stifle such claims. Even if one assumes that it acts in good faith in such cases, it is bound to be influenced by its own view of the legality of its underlying decision. So I think this is a further, highly unsatisfactory, structural problem that will arise with the use of section 10 to remedy problems caused by the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">residence</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> test.  </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 2pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">(3)</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">OTHER BREACHES OF HUMAN RIGHTS </span></p><ol start="23" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 11pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Whilst the law remains to an extent untested, as to the variety of circumstances in which a refusal of legal aid will in itself give rise to a breach of the ECHR or EU law, I do not think that there is any doubt that there will be significant areas of law in which it will be difficult or impossible to meet the section 10 test. Article 6 ECHR is engaged where an individual’s “civil rights” are in play. There are significant areas of modern public law where civil rights will not be engaged, but which nevertheless involve decision making about fundamental human rights. Examples include the community care and immigration fields, where what may be at stake will include bodily integrity, family break-up, removal to countries where a flagrant breach of human rights might occur, and access to basic subsistence. </span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 11pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">This being so, if </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">the residence test and prison law changes are introduced</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, and even if the section 10 criteria are applied generously, and without error, there will be a significant increase in the number of cases where individuals litigating about basic rights will not get legal aid to assist  with that litigation.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> That will, inevitably I think, lead to increases in human rights breaches in the UK.

In some cases the public body may even be grateful to a claimant who has brought its own errors to its attention. This process, at least where public bodies are responsive early on, is not expensive, but it is invaluable. It is an essential part of the way the modern state operates, and corrects its own errors, in circumstances where the volume of governmental decision making and legislation is such that it is impossible for scrutiny to be done solely by Parliament and politicians. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Most</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> cases do not involve courts striking down decisions taken by politicians on controversial issues, but the correction of errors by </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">public bodies</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> so as to ensure that they act in accordance with Parliament’s intentions</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> as expressed in legislation</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> That is prosaic, but no less important. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 11pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Further, just as for every one case that goes to final hearing there are many that settle, so for every case that settles there are many that do not need to be brought at all, because</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">potential litigants know that rights can be enforced if they misbehave. That is true in private law, and in my experience it is equally true for public law and government decision making. When weighing costs and benefits, you cannot judge the benefits of legal aid by looking solely at the benefit to the individual to whom it has been granted. There is a wider benefit because decision makers know that their decisions can be </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">effectively</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> challenged, and must be able to stand up to scrutiny in court. I think that the restrictions on legal aid that are being proposed for judicial review (not just the residence test), are likely to have serious, adverse, consequences for the quality, and legality, of government decision making.  </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 11pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">27 October 2013</span></p><div style="width:auto; height:auto; float:left;"><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">1</span></p></div><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div><hr style="width:33%; height:1px; text-align:left" /><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><a name="_ftn1"></a><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt"> In theory one could contemplate a judicial review of the refusal of funding for the judicial review, and so on </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic">ad infinitum</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">.
