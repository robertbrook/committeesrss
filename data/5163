This figure can be as high as 40% for some retail stores, with much evidence to suggest that many non-tobacco sales are in fact additional purchases made by adult smokers coming in store to buy tobacco.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:TT14o00; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:TT17o00; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">4.0 Concerns</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:TT14o00; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:TT14o00; font-size:11pt">4.1 The illicit trade in tobacco products has, in the experience of our members, grown significantly in recent years. Any type of illicit trade, whether counterfeit or contraband, deprives responsible retailers of much needed revenue and only benefits criminal gangs who are less scrupulous as to who they sell cigarettes to. The illicit trade in tobacco also deprives the Government of much needed revenues with HMRC estimating the loss to be nearly £2billion.</span><a name="_ftnref1"></a><a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:TT1Do00; font-size:7pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:TT14o00; font-size:11pt">4.2 At the same time as our members have seen the illicit market growing, law enforcement agencies and local authorities have experienced cuts to their budgets. In our view, this has led to an ‘enforcement-gap’ on the ground. Combine this with the lack of coordination and cooperation between HMRC, Trading Standards and local police forces, we have seen the effectiveness of law enforcement and local authorities significantly diminish in recent years.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:TT14o00; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:TT14o00; font-size:11pt">4.3 As an organisation we would like to see this addressed as a priority for Government and we welcome the conclusion of the recent Public Accounts Committee report which makes clear that more must be done by the law enforcement agencies to provide a co-ordinated approach to tackling the flow of illicit tobacco within our borders.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:TT14o00; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:TT14o00; font-size:11pt">4.4 However, the experience of our members is that a large amount of the volume of illicit tobacco coming into the UK is cigarettes known as ‘illicit whites’. As we understand it, these products are being manufactured legally in other countries purely to be smuggled into the UK and other countries. We would urge the government to see if anything can be done to stem this flow to protect small retailers and also their own revenues.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:TT1Eo00; font-size:6.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:TT14o00; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">5.0 </span><span style="font-family:TT19o00; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Potential Impact of Plain Packaging in Ireland</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:TT19o00; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:TT14o00; font-size:11pt">5.1 NABA does not have the expertise to provide a comprehensive view on the impact on the UK of plain packaging in Ireland. However, we believe the views we submitted as part of the UK consultation on plain packaging are equally applicable in this instance; or indeed to the prospect of plain packaging in Scotland.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:TT14o00; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:TT14o00; font-size:11pt">5.2 It is clear that the impact of any prohibitive legislation at the UK border will have an impact on the quantity and availability of illicit tobacco within our borders. The natural effect of plain packaging is to make cigarettes easier to counterfeit. The consequent growth in the illicit trade and the likely increase in smuggled branded cigarettes will place extra pressure on HMRC officers at the Irish border and ports and airports serving Ireland at a time when resources – as set out above – are stretched.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:TT14o00; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:TT14o00; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">6.0 </span><span style="font-family:TT17o00; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Current sanctions and penalties</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:TT14o00; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:TT14o00; font-size:11pt">6.1 Combined with the lack of sufficient enforcement, our members have also frustration at the apparent lack of adequate penalties and sanctions.
