font-size:12pt">-</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">worth, they did not get a very good deal.  Did you undervalue them, or did the buyer overvalue them?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">away </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">with a good deal, and we certainly got value for money for the taxpayer.  That figure of over £800 million is a nominal value.  In reality, most of these mortgage loans were not in repayment, or people who had the debt were below the earnings threshold.  We were always very realistic that this last tranche of residuals were the least-well-performing mortgage loans and their actual commercial value would be significantly below their face value.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">As for the price that we eventually got, I think it was very reasonable.  There are areas of commercial negotiation that by convention always remain confidential, but I think we got a very good price given that these were underperforming loans.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt"> this could be a benefit for everyone is that, with my ministerial responsibilities for the Student Loans Company, I am thinking, for example, of the problems we had in getting payments out to students in 2009, less than five years ago.  We want the Student Loans Company to focus on its core task, which is delivering a high-quality service to students when they apply for loans, and administering the big asset: ensuring repayment of the income-contingent loans.  It was never going to be a priority use of staff or resource for the Student Loans Company to chase the last remaining underperforming mortgage loans. However, for the companies that specialise in underperforming loans</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> already have an infrastructure in place</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> know how to handle them, they may be able to put in time, effort and expertise that the Student Loans Company does not possess and do a better job than the Student Loans Company could have done.  That was clearly the assessment of the range of people we had who tendered for the loan book.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q97 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You have partly answered my next question, which is along the lines of: why could the Department not have realised those efficiencies?  What you are saying in effect is that these companies are better equipped to recoup the money than the Student Loans Company.  My concern is that you threw in the comment that their priority would be the income-contingent loan book, which is that much greater.  The problem I have with that is that, if they are not very good at recouping these historic loans, what evidence is there to believe that they will be any better with the income-contingent loans?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr Willetts</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: That is a completely different structure.  In reality, the vast bulk of those loans will be repaid via HMRC and linked to income tax.  The old mortgage loans had a different structure and different repayment arrangements.  Most of them were no longer in repayment. Any person considering the focus of activities of the Student Loans Company would not have said it was a good use of public money or resource for this small and busy organisation to follow up the residual</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> potentially obtainable sums out of the £800</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">million</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in theory</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> of mortgage loans.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">You are right, Chair, that the big tasks for the Student Loans Company are very simple.  </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The f</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">irst</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">higher quality student experience as they apply for loans, and that we are working on.

Those are our priorities.  I do not think that any Minister in recent years has suggested that it is a priority of the Student Loans </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Company to chase up the ancient mortgage-based loans on a different model, but we think that someone else who specialises in that can do it better.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt"> The reply that you have not made, which I think is quite interesting, is the one that I might have expected.  Given that the Chancellor has predicated his </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">B</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">udget assumptions on the sale of at least a tranche, or several tranches, of the income-continent loans, would not the responsibility for the collection of those then move on to another body?  You made no reference to that whatsoever.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr Willetts</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There will be a different structure.  Here, we are obviously being advised by Rothschild and Barclays Capital.  In advance, there are lots of operational decisions still being taken, but the repayment of the income-contingent loans is done via HMRC in most cases, and that arrangement will not be changed as and when the income-contingent loan book, or tranches from it, is sold.  There will be a kind of server facility, as it is called technically, which will be an interface between commercial owners of the loans, as and when they are sold, and the continuing system whereby graduates will be paying back, via HMRC in most cases, in an unchanged way.  The mortgage loans were completely different.  There was not any use of HMRC.  It is much more like conventional debt collection, and it therefore made sense to sell the remaining loans to people whose specialisation is conventional debt collection.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">front from the proceeds of sale of this part of the loan book, but revenue is being forgone that transfers to the private sector.  His assessment is that £1.7 billion ought to be netted out of those figures from 2016 through to 2019, which would have a very important effect on the costing of the policy of expansion.  Can you explain what discussions you have had with the Treasury about why gross proceeds appeared in the autumn statement policy costings and not net proceeds of the sale?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

there are the gross proceeds from the sale of the loan book; and there is another line showing revisions to student loan repayments</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;
