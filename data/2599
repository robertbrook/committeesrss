We are of the view that the educational process should commence at an appropriate age and that this should be a continued theme throughout a young person’s learning. It is essential that young people understand the vulnerabilities and threats posed to their personal safety, lifelong reputation and wellbeing. We also believe that it is important to encourage responsibility and understanding of the consequence of the misuse of the on line world and rapidly changing technologies.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="2" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.25pt; padding-left:4.75pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">We support a coordinated approach from key public, private and voluntary stakeholders to educate the wider public with the continued risk from those who seek to exploit the misuse of online safety.

It is fair to acknowledge that policing must continually invest in the training and equipping members of staff with the tools to recognise and investigate on line misuse. Without appropriate levels of investment, training and equipping in technologies, the threat of harm and risk will expand. A joined up strategy should be developed by the College of Policing and other key stakeholders to allow the police service and others to maximise resources, understanding and training.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="10" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">It will be important for key stakeholders to recognise threats, weaknesses and opportunities ensuring self-regulation and legislative opportunities are maximised to protect our communities.

The current National Crime Recording Standards in our view fail to record the real number of victims and scale of on line crime. We fully support a review of National Crime Recording Standards to ensure the level of threat is understood, appropriate resources are allocated and threat management is maximised.  We are also of the view that there is reluctance from some quarters to report fraud due to possible reputational issues. This is particularly applicable to the finance industry and must be overcome.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="12" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">We believe that criminality has recognised the opportunity to migrate offending to on line services and that offending will continue to exploit such opportunities.
