It takes skill to present a career in facilities management as one that can be creative and fulfilling.

It is not enough for schools and the Government to simply put up websites without even letting young people know they exist or to put any obligation on schools to make sure young people are even accessing this information.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Although 99% of 16 to 24 years old use the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Internet </span><a name="_ftnref4"></a><a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">, it is what they are using it for that is interesting.

Schools clearly have the need for material to give their students and have told us they use the magazine as a working document – in the classroom, careers evenings and to take home to share with parents. There is no doubt the demand is there for more than a hyperlink. In fact, many of our school subscribers have sent us unsolicited messages to say that they are struggling to provide their students with any kind of literature to take home or </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">that</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> they can use in the classroom to discuss with students. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">In addition to school subscribers, Sector Skills Councils, with whom we work closely, take bulk copies to hand out at career events.

All are happy to be represented amongst the others because they want young people to choose to join them well informed about the direction they are taking. It is no good investing time and funds in a new recruit or student, only to have them leave because it was not the right choice. Knowing what is involved at the start is crucial. Whilst Michael Gove does not see a problem with all young people doing A-Levels, however businesses, universities and apprenticeship providers do. It is often reported to us that it is expensive and time-consuming taking a young person on board only to find they do not have a full understanding to what they are committing. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Conflict of interest</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The single biggest issue raised by the Government policy to devolve the responsibility to schools to provide independent career advice is the funding. If a school, college or sixth form is told it must provide independent career advice, but it receives its funding by keeping “bums on seats” in their sixth form, they will clearly have a difficult decision to make. For example, currently schools receive approximately £4,500 per young person on their register in their sixth form. If a school with a sixth form with, say, 1,500 students and 10% take the advice to go to the local college that would mean they would lose nearly £675,000 of funding. Whatever the moral fibre of a Head Teacher to do the best by their students, this would be a difficult call to make.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The Association of Colleges’ president, Michele Sutton, told the BBC of its concerns that schools are not providing impartial advice and that young people are actively being steered towards staying in the school’s sixth form: “They end up in the wrong institution, usually school sixth forms, doing the wrong course, and recently published Education Funding Agency data shows that schools lose 50% of their pupils between year 11 and year 13. How many end up not in education, employment and training.” </span><a name="_ftnref8"></a><a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Paul Jackson, CEO of Engineering UK, told the Education Committee “if Ofsted are not overseeing it and grading it, or if it is not appearing in a league table, then it will not get those hours.” </span><a name="_ftnref9"></a><a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">During my time as a college lecturer, I personally saw the impact that the closing of Connexions has had. The responsibility of giving career advice fell directly on the lecturers with little or no training. Many did not have any experience of giving career advice. It adds pressure and strain on already overstretched timetables. As a School Governor, I have also seen the pressure this has had on several schools and discussed it with Governors from further afield. As there is no obligation to provide career advice, many schools have provided as little as possible – for funding reasons and to avoid the added aggravation.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Gil Howarth, CEO of the National Skills Academies, told me he was very worried that schools will not encourage their students to take up an apprenticeship. The industries, such as the railway engineering and construction, are crying out for recruits, but most young people are unaware of the opportunities available. There is a perception problem about what the work might entail and schools are unable or unwilling to provide the necessary information. Representatives from large </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">corporates</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> in the construction and engineering industries told me that they have even been effectively prevented access by some schools.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">As Graham Stuart MP said: “Ministers assume that schools will always do the best thing for the children in their care but, in reality, schools will deliver what they are measured on.”</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Businesses to provide careers advice</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The Government has made it clear that it wants career advice to come primarily from businesses. Real-life contact with the world of work is an excellent way to find out more about what working in different industries is like. However, the reality of putting this into place in a well-rounded and effective way is very difficult. There is no obligation on businesses to provide this service. Whilst large organisations have HR departments to plan and deliver career days and talks, often SMEs have neither the time nor resources to do so. Vince Cable recently admitted there has been “very low up-take” of apprenticeships citing there is an issue around minimum wage being too low to entice apprentices, but if it’s raised it will no longer be attractive to SMEs. </span><a name="_ftnref10"></a><a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">On the other side of the coin, schools that need their students to stay on in their sixth form have been known to do the minimum of their obligation to actively engage with employers offering traineeships and apprenticeships, as well as colleges offering vocational courses.
