Even if we, in collaboration with all the other green lane groups around the country, can persuade Parliament to consider the inclusion of our proposals in their bill, there will be hours and hours of wrangling over the precise terms of the clauses.  And let us not kid ourselves into believing that 4x4 and motorbike users will realise that their game is up.  Many vehicle users recognise that, in the long term, their cause is doomed, but they will hang on for as long as they can, trying to obstruct any legislation that jeopardises their activities.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';

font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">BOATs and UCRs are the categories that comprise Dales green lanes.  Restricted Byways have rights of way for pedestrians, horses, horse-drawn carriages, pedal-cyclists and motor vehicles needed for access to premises (eg farm vehicles, fire engines), but not for recreational motors.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';
