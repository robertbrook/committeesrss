padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">I find it very difficult to answer this questionnaire in terms of the 8 numbered paragraphs provided.  That is because, while there is an impact on employment generally due to economic problems on the global scale, the problem in the EU is the EU itself. </span><br /><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span></li><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">It is no coincidence that the lowest youth unemployment rates are in the more industrialised areas of Europe.  The rate in the UK is higher than several of those industrialised countries because we have lost much of our industrial base.  </span><br /><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></li><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">It is also no coincidence that the highest rates of youth unemployment are in member states who have taken the Euro.  Their inability to operate with an interest rate suitable for their own situation, coupled with an exchange rate at the same level as the countries with lower youth unemployment rates, means that those countries are unable properly to organise their own economy.  </span><br /><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></li><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">If those countries with the highest youth unemployment rates were able to leave the Euro and re-establish their former currencies with their own interest rates and with rates of exchange largely determined by market forces, they would see a certain if gradual improvement.  Their exports would become cheaper on the world markets, promoting their trade and hence their economy.  That would mean lower pay for employees generally in those countries but that surely is preferable to high youth unemployment rates.  The question is simple, ‘Do they want low paid jobs, or no jobs at all?’.  </span><br /><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></li><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The EU is now trashing around trying to find answers to this problem within its structures.  As a result we have the 6 billion Euro Youth Employment Initiative.  I have no confidence that this will produce any lasting beneficial effect.  One must remember that the EU’s own Court of Auditors has refused to sign the books for over 16 years.  In fact, there has been a qualified attempt to sign the books in the last two or three years, but by only employing a Stratagem.   The EU Auditors now lay the blame for the missing millions of Euros at the door of member states.  That is where, they say, that the money has gone missing by way of misappropriation and other unspecified reasons.  This begs the question as to why the EU budget is not more carefully monitored in the first place.  </span><br /><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></li><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Among the measures listed in your document is that of ‘Apprenticeships’.  Here one must look for an example to the UK.  Until some 20 or 30 years ago many education authorities operated Technical and Commercial Schools.  Both of these prepared young people to enter into appropriate employment, very often by way of an apprenticeship.  The abolition of both Technical Schools, and Colleges of Further Education providing those kinds of courses by way of amalgamating them with Universities, has seen that route to employment closed off.  It is of course young people who have borne the brunt of that missing factor.  It has also contributed to </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">our own loss of industrial base.  </span><br /><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></li><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">I do not therefore seek to promote grand EU wide schemes as a way out of this difficulty.  Still less do I welcome the spending of these extraordinary sums of money in an attempt to remedy the problem.  Without doubt much of this money will be wasted or diverted from its intended use when it could have been spent by the member states retaining their share of that money and using it to promote their own schemes.  The best people to spend public money are the people who directly provided it in the first place through their own elected representatives.  All the decisions taken to alleviate this problem must be taken as close to the people it concerns as possible.</span><br /><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></li><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 32pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">None of the above means that the UK, or any other member state, should promote a siege mentality.  A glance through the historical records of those individuals who initiated local schemes, methods or working and above all scientific discovery leads one to realise that those initiatives were taken up across Europe and indeed the world.  I would go further and suggest that this host of entrepreneurs discovered and established their ideas not because they were members of a vast continental entity, but because they came from, and related to, their own country with all that that means in terms of heritage and local promotion.  These people became prominent in their own country and that prominence became widespread to the benefit of all.  In short, good ideas always spread. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';
