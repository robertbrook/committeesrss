font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Good morning.  Welcome to this session of the Education Select Committee inquiry into the underperformance in education of white </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">working</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">­</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">class</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> children.  We have just about an hour, and a full panel of experts and a lot to get through, so I will ask my colleagues to keep their questions short.  If you could make your answers as succinct as possible, that would be extremely helpful as well.  Would a focus on white working-class underperformance</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">we will go into detail on the definition of each of the terms, every one of which is contentious</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">be helpful in addressing our, at best, mediocre performance in the PISA tables released yesterday?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Demie</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Thank you very much for inviting me.  I think some of my presentation will be based on one of the pieces of research I have done in Lambeth schools.  We purposefully asked head teachers, governors and parents who we interviewed what they mean by the term “working class”.  Interestingly, we actually found it very difficult to come up with a clear terminology for what working class actually means.  Everyone we talked to had a different interpretation of what working class is.  Really, everybody talked in general about what white </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">working class actually is.  We could not get a very clear definition from the focus group we had done.  We really ended up using a terminology of “white British who are on free school meals”, which, nationally, is also used by the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">DfE</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and a number of researchers.  I am afraid that that is really the terminology I am using in terms of whatever interpretation I do.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Julian King-Harris</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I suppose the brief answer is, “Yes, it would”.  It is something that has been going on in this country for a considerable amount of time—the performance of that particular group of people—and it would make a very significant difference in a whole range of issues in this country if we could raise the aspirations and the attainment of that group.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt">those </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">entitled to free school meals</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, do you think that is the most helpful area to focus on?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Julian King-Harris</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is the easiest identifiable group.  In terms of schools, that is how we can identify them easily, and the paperwork you sent out beforehand refers to them frequently in that particular category.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gillborn</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Addressing that group, however it is defined, would make a significant contribution to improving the position in the international tables, but that focus needs to be done intelligently.  It is not about just focusing on one group, however it is defined.  You can focus on any underachieving group, but you should do it with an awareness of how different levels of inequality and different identities intersect.  It is not just about one ethnic group or one social class group.  Gender is important, disability is hugely important, and these things interact.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">One of the key concerns with the way in which the public debate about so-called white working-class underachievement has taken place is that, actually, the statistics refer to a very small group on free school meals</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">about 14%</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">but about 60% of the population</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> hear “working class” and think of themselves.  That starts to feed into wider debates about ethnicity and about a sense of belonging.  The debate about education can become lost amid a wider debate about participation in public processes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal;

font-size:12pt"> The share of the white population that is entitled to free school meals is a relatively small percentage of the whole.  Is there some risk of distortion there?  Effectively, if you have a small percentage who are poor, may be disabled, and have other issues, then you could be reading in cultural and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">aspirational</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> issues that are not really there.  You are simply looking at a small percentage of people who have difficulties.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gillborn</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There are problems of two sorts, really.  One is that it is easy to fall into a kind of deficit analysis: an assumption that, if a group is underachieving, there must be a problem with the group, whereas we have an awful lot of research showing that schools tend to treat different groups in systematically different ways.  Stereotypes about children who live in poverty or are in care often close down the opportunities that they have, despite having good aspirations.  The other good point is around the fact that, in the white group, I think it is about 12% who qualify for free school meals; overall, it is 14% of the school population.  Free-school-meal data are reported as relating to the working class; the last British Social Attitudes Survey suggested that 60% of adults consider themselves working class.  Then you </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">have headlines that suggest to 60% of the population that their children are underachieving significantly, and so the debates about poverty get lost amid a wider question of whether white people are suffering because of multiculturalism, which I think is hugely dangerous.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jerrim</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We need to be clear what the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">PISA</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> data show, and what other international comparisons actually show us.  The OECD report yesterday, and my own work on social class differences, suggest that, actually, the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> within the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, are unspectacular compared with other nations in this respect.  The gap between rich and poor in this country in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">PISA</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> test scores is no bigger here, really, than the OECD average.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Of course, yes, there are some countries where the gap is narrower, such as </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Finland</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, but compared to the broad group of industrialised nations, we are pretty much unspectacular.  Obviously, one of the bigger pictures around this is social mobility, and we also need to be clear about international comparisons of social mobility.  It is often said that we are at the bottom of the international rankings in those terms.  That evidence is weak, and there is actually very little evidence that we are at the bottom of that league table, also.  We need to be clear on the international evidence and what it actually shows us, and to get that right before we start jumping in to say, “Does this explain our low performance?”</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

it is social activities; it is the politics; and it is the dress.  For the people that I know, that is how I define and differentiate between middle class and other classes.  I find this all quite difficult.  I do not know the occupations or anything.  I do not know all that for the people that I mix with who are working class.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">Ofsted</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.  Actually, schools are really complicated institutions, and a lot of the things that we take for granted within those institutions do not help us achieve the goals that we want.  If we want more kids from families like the ones you described</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In primary schools, there is selection between different desks.  Even kids sitting in the same room are covering less of the curriculum, because that table is judged to have more ability than this table, and we know that ability is a complex, multi-faceted thing that changes over time.  Yet our society treats ability as if it is something that you are stamped with internally, and if you have more ability at five, you are going to have more ability throughout.  The clues that schools and teachers use to identify the kids that will achieve and that will tick the boxes, are shaped by prejudices around class, around gender, around ethnicity and around disability.  The way in which we organise education makes it increasingly unlikely that kids from non-traditional backgrounds will excel, because the system is set against them.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

you are capable of excelling,” whereas they would tend to talk to a black Caribbean student on the same grade and say. “You are doing really well; you are going to get a C.”  Those differences work through the whole system, and are incredibly powerful.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt">the back; I think you were hoping to be brought in.  I may not be able to control my Committee, but I am determined to at least control the audience in the back.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Francis</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Quite rightly so.  There are a couple of points I wanted to come in on, really.  One was around the performance indicators question that Pat asked.  I personally feel that the newly proposed indicators for 2016 will make a real difference here.  It is a good balance of focusing on the basics, the maths and English, and prioritising that; also, keeping options open for elite and appreciated career paths, access to higher education and so on through the little basket of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">EBacc</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

we cannot say that was a golden age of attainment.  This is a long tale of educational failure for the working classes, or poor attainment for the working classes in this country, and that is a huge barrier in trying to raise attainment now, because you are looking at children who are coming from families that have a multi-generational experience of school not being great for them.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">of low evidence-based</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> expectations of what school would deliver for them.  It is really important to remember that the league tables that came in, I think, in the 1980s and 1990s only exposed the gap between working-class boys and the rest.  They did not contribute to it.  Girls’ acceleration and ethnic minority acceleration of performance has not pushed white working-class boys’ attainment down.  It has simply exposed what was already there.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

others do not.  If you make it action-oriented, rather than aspiration-oriented, do you find interesting differences?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';

font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> education system.  It has not realised their aspirations; it has not helped them.  They want, often, to protect their children from the painful experiences that they had themselves going through education.  We talk about resilience; if you are placed in a low set or a low-ability table from age six, pick up the messages that you are being told </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">about your place in the education system, and then you go through school in a low set, you are pretty resilient to survive at all, I would say, and come out intact.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

often, interestingly, very low interaction with the school, but with incredibly high aspirations.  Really, success in education is being seen as an absolutely fundamental part of what it means to be Chinese in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

I was talking about educational achievement.  We have a paper coming out next week, the first one on GCSE scores, for example, and we are interested in individual differences in GCSE scores.  What we are asking is, “To what extent are those differences between children due to genetic differences?”  I know that is anathema for a lot of people in education, but I really hope the Committee will take the important role of genetics seriously.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In the media brouhaha following that Dominic Cummings report, I find there have been two major misunderstandings about what it means to say there is genetic influence.  The first is like Polly Toynbee’s headline about this, about 70% of a child’s reading ability being determined by genetics.  First, I would like to say that we are not talking about just significant effects; we are talking about very substantial effects.  If schools account for 20% of the variance, the research throughout the world points to about 50% of the variance being due to genetic differences between children, but that does not mean that 50% of your reading or math ability is due to genetics.  It is about the population, and on average, the differences between children in their reading ability are, say, 50% or so due to genetic, DNA differences between them.  It is a variance issue, and people have a lot of trouble understanding that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The second one they have a lot of trouble understanding is that genetic influence does not mean pre-determinism or hard-wiring.  You do not learn to read or to speak unless you are exposed to an environment that lets you see letters and words and that sort of thing.  Words are not innate in your head; you have to learn to read.  But, as all of you who are parents know, some kids learn more readily, and some struggle to learn how to read.  That is the other thing that people mix up.  It does not mean innate; it just means that there are genetic influences and differences between children in how readily they learn to read or to do maths.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">wing agenda, like the Finnish model, where you say that based on that, there are these individual differences that exist due to genetic differences that are going to be hard to erase; therefore, you might want to put all of your resources in the low end and define minimal levels of literacy and numeracy, and do what it takes to get kids up to that level so that they can participate in an increasingly technological society.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That is a different level—the policy implication.  What I am most excited about is that it suggests to me a very different way of thinking about education.  You were kind of dismissing it in a way by saying, “It just tells us kids are different”, but does it?  I think it tells us a lot more.  It suggests that kids create their own environment genetically.  The DNA does not code for reading ability.  Kids differ in their appetites as well as their aptitudes, and they create and seek and modify environments that are correlated with their genetic propensities.  It suggests to me an active view of education that is literally leading out, rather than the old passive view of instruction, cramming in.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

it tells us that the causes of underachievement are the same causes throughout the whole distribution.  That is important information.  There are not unique genetic causes of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">underachievement.  It is the same genetic and environmental causes that run throughout the distribution.  That is important.  It is the same genetics for boys and girls; the same genetics for early school years as later school years.  I think these are very important facts, and I am not a policy expert.  That is what you guys do.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

putting in interventions, testing interventions, and coming back to it.  If we are talking about more information that we could enter to make the data more robust and mean that resources are better targeted and that interventions that we try can be better tracked, as to whether they are making differences to individuals, that could be really useful.  It is a big gap in terms of implementation.  We should not just assume that schools would have the capacity and abilities to use that data smartly.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

they are different from birth.  They differ genetically, hugely.  It seems to us that personalised learning is one thing that almost follows conceptually from this, just along the lines you were saying.  Give the children opportunities to see what they are good at, and to see what they like to do.  I firmly believe that genetics is as much appetites</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That sounds like something that is very hard for you to do on a policy level, but if you look at one of the interesting things about London Challenge, when they closed some of these gaps they did not necessarily say, “You all need to do this.”  They said, “Right, I want you to identify an issue in your school, plan how you are going to address that issue, and then here is a pot of funding that you can bid to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">Manchester</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> variations.  The gap that is opening up between metropolitan areas and non-large metropolitan areas is concerning, particularly if you look at where the lowest income groups of white working-class are.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Again, that was a point well made that we are talking about white boys on free school meals here, and where they are concentrated.  It is less and less in large metropolitan areas.  We did a map, mapping where the biggest NEET hotspots were, and they were not the metropolitan areas; they were very much the ex-industrial towns and areas, and some seaside towns.  We looked at what was happening in schools there.  Specifically focusing on them is really important.  Becky was talking about improving schools, which is of course important, but even if all FSM children were in outstanding schools, that would only close the attainment gap by a fifth.  You are looking at what is happening to individual pupils who are falling behind within schools, good or bad, and how personalised learning and one-to-one work is being taken forward.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">Rowntree</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Foundation looked at what specific schools were doing in terms of helping parents to understand what they could do to help their kids, what they could do over the weekend with their kids, or what they need to do at home to create an environment in which they can learn; how they can invite parents into schools in ways that are friendly and unthreatening for parents who might have had a negative experience of schooling.  There are those kinds of parental things that are perfectly scalable.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Then, in terms of careers, there is an issue with making decisions at an early stage, which can then affect future life choices.  I mean that from a very early stage, because there is a difference in terms of knowledge of the employment market, so to speak.  A kid starting secondary school may want to be a doctor, but may not know that maths is being part of being a doctor and that you need to work hard in maths as well as in sciences, or whatever.  They need to have that kind of support on what they will need to do to get to their careers from an early stage, and then some of the things I mentioned earlier on about the sharing of good practice.  Schools can build links with schools in other areas that are doing better and learn from them.  Those are the three areas.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">if I want to go to a university</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">then I have to go to another town.  I have to leave my community.  I have to leave my friends.  I have to</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> do all these things.”  That is very different from areas like </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, where those things are on the doorstep and you can manage that dual life in a very different way here.  That is very difficult, because it is not an easy fix, is it?  We are talking about major geographical and economic issues here.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;
