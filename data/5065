This is a deliberate decision as it is our belief that numerical targets can lead to perverse or unintended consequences. By this we mean that if we were to set a crime reduction target of 10% for bicycle theft this could result in officers concentrating on bicycle theft in order to meet the target and not picking up on other emerging or relevant areas of crime as they were not named as specific targets. The approach adopted in Derbyshire has been to drive continuous improvement in performance which is driven through a robust performance framework that identifies key risks and manifesto priorities (Objective 5 of the Police and Crime Plan). This approach is similar to that adopted previously by the Police Authority and has helped deliver 10 years of crime reduction in Derbyshire, with a 16% reduction in recorded crime in 2011/12. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt; font-style:italic">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt; font-style:italic">What impact do you think this has on police recording crime practices? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">As we do not have numeric targets within the Police and Crime Plan it mitigates the unintended consequences I outlined in my response above and removes any consideration of meeting or missing targets within crime recording decisions. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt; font-style:italic">How do you assure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">Headline performance data and figures are monitored at a monthly public meeting, our Strategic Governance Board. We have a performance analyst within the PCC’s staffing team who briefs the PCC and I on the data presented and highlighting any concerns about the data, including any concerns about accuracy. The PCC/Force’s Joint Audit, Risk and Assurance Committee (JARAC) has a standing agenda item on data quality which offers assurance on data integrity. (A copy of the most recent report/appendices is attached to this letter.) We also gained assurance of the data integrity through the HMIC independent inspection in January 2012 and are looking forward to the outcomes of the forthcoming inspection HMIC are due to undertake in the coming months. This external scrutiny and oversight will highlight any issues to be taken forward and will, I am sure, confirm our trust in the statistics. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt; font-style:italic">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt; font-style:italic">To what extent can you trust the crime statistics for your area? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">We believe that the approach we have taken to target setting within Derbyshire has established a culture wherein any temptation to manipulate crime statistics has been removed.
