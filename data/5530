Our nine member groups operate over 40 ports in all parts of the country and handle around 70% of the UK’s international trade by volume. UKMPG member ports are all privately financed and do not seek financial help from the taxpayer. Annual investment (much of it inward) in upgrading and developing UK port facilities is running at around £400m a year and despite the current economic climate this investment has been increasing as several large container port projects are taken forward. Moreover ports are hugely important to the national and local economy.  A recent independent study carried out by the consultants Oxford Economics has shown that UK ports directly and indirectly employ some 390,000 people and contribute around £21bn annually to UK GDP.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Introduction</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">3</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">UKMPG strongly supports the concept of sustainable development with an appropriate balance being struck between environmental protection and the needs of the economy and society. We have therefore seen no difficulty in the creation of a network of Marine Conservation Zones which are properly based on the principles of sustainable development. As well as making provision for MCZs, the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 also set up arrangements for a system of marine planning for England. UKMPG’s view has consistently been that it would be better to take decisions on MCZs in the context of marine plans which are also intended to promote sustainable development rather than decide on MCZs in advance of such plans. We suggest that many of the difficulties to date associated with MCZ designations would have been better addressed had marine planning taken precedence and we trust that future decisions on MCZs will be increasingly guided by the marine planning process.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Initial </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">MCZ designations</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">4</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The 31 initial draft designations put forward by the Government in late 2012 did not in general have a sizeable impact on UKMPG member ports. The exception was the proposal for an MCZ in the Stour/Orwell estuary where designation and the ensuing management measures could have caused significant disruption to operations in the ports of Felixstowe, Harwich and Ipswich. We were therefore pleased that Stour/Orwell was not included in the final set of 27 MCZ designations announced by the Government in November 2013 and will no longer be considered for MCZ status.  This sends a clear signal that socio-economic factors are being given important weight in MCZ decision taking which is fully in line with the letter and spirit of the 2009 MCA Act. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">5</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Looking ahead we still have a number of concerns </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">There is still little clarity about the form that management measures in MCZ sites should take.

While there has been welcome clarification that sites which are not being designated in the first tranche will not be a material consideration in marine licensing applications, this still leaves many ports facing the situation that a recommended MCZ site might become designated in due course which could then have a significant impact on the development and/or operation of that port. This is inevitably going to give rise to uncertainty which could adversely affect investment in that port and maybe its ability to respond quickly to market changes. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We suggest this situation could be addressed as a first step by the Government carrying out an early review of potential MCZ sites which represent a blight risk and dropping any proposed designations which would add relatively little net ecological benefit taking account of the considerable number of EU NATURA 2000 MPA sites which already exist in port areas.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">6</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">A number of more detailed points are covered in the response to the Committee’s specific questions set out in the annex below.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">ANNEX</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Response to the EAC’s specific questions</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><ol type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:11.25pt 0pt 11.25pt 23.11pt; padding-left:3.89pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">The plans for implementing the 27 so far approved MCZs</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> We are not involved in these plans / implementation as the sites should not </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">in general significantly </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">affect </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">UKMPG </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">port operations</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">.

We urge Defra to develop management options for each site as a matter of priority and for all future site consultations to provide clear indications of the management measures proposed.
