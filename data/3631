text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Nigel Shadbolt:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> They have a pretty good track record of pushing innovation in this space, but one has to say that there is no single reason for doing open data.  People will talk about transparency and accountability; they will talk about efficiency in public-sector delivery; and they will talk about generating economic growth, all of which open data can be in the service of—or increasing participation or enhancing the quality of the data itself.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There are eight or nine distinct reasons, and that is one of the reasons that open data is also somewhat non</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The problem is that there is so much to do, it is so important and so urgent, and is Government capable of meeting the challenge in the way that it is looking at doing it?  One of the things I recommended in my review was that there needed to be some external driver of it and that it was necessary to have a twin-track approach to data.  I will not go into the details of this idea here, but it is a way of getting data out very fast and not leaving it in the hands of Government.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Nigel Shadbolt:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">  In some respects, the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is world leading.  It has put really rather difficult data sets out there at scale, everything from reported crime through to health data and spending data, but the “publish it and they will come” model is not quite enough.  One of the reasons that we established the Open</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Data</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Institute was to generate a vibrant demand for open data.  I do not think high-quality supply will flourish unless you have businesses and organisations and public-sector Departments whose business depends on the flow of that high-quality information.  One area where the message is not fully understood yet is that the biggest beneficiary is the public sector itself, the Departments of State, in consuming their own information and the information of other Departments in a much less difficult, complex and expensive fashion.  That is one of the real prizes of open data. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">“Set too low” partly refers to the fact—and the previous evidence session covered some of this—that whenever you get into a discussion about whether we should sell the data or make it available as open data, too often the short-term interests of selling data for a few million pounds here and there trumps the wider economic and public good that would come from making it available as part of the national information infrastructure.  Perhaps we will talk about that later.  This is a very important development, this idea of a national information infrastructure.  One of the most important things that we see coming out of this development is that, in future, states like ours, countries like ours, will need to really take care that their national information infrastructure is supported, curated, maintained and enhanced in the same way that it is for roads, for electricity distribution or for power.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Shakespeare, you talk about the need for stronger, clear leadership, for driving implementation of a national data strategy, and say that there should be a single body with a single public interface for driving increased access to public-service information.  Does that not already exist?  Is that not what the body that is being created does? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-weight:bold"> Shakespeare</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There is no single body that does that.  We did have the Data Strategy Board that was sort of doing some of that and looking at it from the accountability side but much more the economic case—the business case.  We have lots of people across Government all committed to the agenda and adding to it really well, but we do not have one author, one body, that is driving this in a joined-up way.  It is notable, for example, that some of my agenda has gone into the Transparency Board, but the other bit has gone into BIS and its capability strategy.  Both are extremely good responses, but I wish they were together.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

it is open licensing and open standards.  In some respects, one of the worst sins that has occurred is the lock in to proprietary standards that companies are able to impose because they have a solution for this particular geospatial product or this particular accounting package, and it does not have any hope of interoperating with other systems.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-weight:bold"> Shakespeare</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: First of all, I want to make it quite clear that the revealing of personal medical data could be extremely painful to the person and that it is incredibly important to avoid that.  I am arguing that it is extremely unlikely to happen if we do this right.  We have what is called safe-haven technology, which means you can make data available in a way that you cannot take it out of the box, if you like, and you can access it remotely without removing it from the database.  You can use it inside the box.  Professor</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Shadbolt will be much better at explaining this, being a genuine data scientist, as opposed to me, who is absolutely not, but the data can be used inside the system; you cannot take it outside.  Very importantly, you know who is using what.  Therefore, if somebody is using data in a particular way, which then appears outside and is revealed later on to have been misused, you could put the responsibility back to that person.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What is incredibly important is that we think about the misuse of data and punishing that, rather than preventing any possibility of misuse of data.  When we talk about data, we get so worked up about it that we forget that the traditional means of safeguarding data are incredibly porous.  It takes probably a few quid from a newspaper—maybe less so now—to somebody standing near a filing cabinet to get important and private data from where it is supposedly securely stored into the hands of a journalist.  Why do we think that traditional data can be so porous and yet we must have no possibility of misuse from digitised data?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">personal information—where the bus stops were, what the contracts where—was not so controversial.  When you start to look at the information</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">sharing schemes across aggregate data or individual data, there you have to say this is personal information and, where it is about the person, we have to use all means at our disposal, including existing legislation.  The Information Commissioner’s Office has powers so that, if people de</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">anonymise data, they can be held accountable for it.  There is a range of things that we can do. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Fundamentally, when we look at the area of personal information, we have to do something rather bold, which is to rectify the deep asymmetry that currently exists between citizen and state, consumer and business.  In fact, we all experience it, business knows loads about us; we do not have that same insight about ourselves that they have.  The state has huge amounts of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">information about us; we do not have access to that information.  There is a notion of really seeing—and this will happen because the technology is going to ensure it—a generation who become their own data controllers, to some extent.  The expectation and assumption is that you will be in possession of your medical records to a certain level, your educational history and transcript, and your entitlements for work and pensions.  If we can engage in the conversation in terms of empowerment back, it is a very different conversation from, “The state will work out how it is going to decide how to share information on you.”  Where that conversation has happened, in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-weight:bold"> Shakespeare</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I have tried to construct a case where somebody would deliberately cause a big problem with data in this way; it is hard to imagine that this would happen.  Occasionally, when privacy campaigners have tried to show that it can be corrupted, they have managed to reveal some tiny detail about somebody very prominent, because that is one of the ways that you can work anonymised data out, because it was known publicly where somebody was.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I just cannot conceive of a likely scenario in which there is a serious problem here, and we do have legislation that can punish offenders.  That should be tightened up and it should be used much more.  That would be a more effective way of safeguarding privacy.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">A famous example is a set of data that was released by an online entertainment company about the films that people watch.  They were trying to get people to provide more innovative solutions around recommendation systems—systems that would recommend films to you.  This anonymised data was released, and then people discovered that there was a site where people had been rating exactly all the films they had watched; it is quite a well known site.  You could take that data plus the other data and then find out exactly who the person was in the released anonymised data and, of course, they had been watching stuff that perhaps they were not so keen to have shared around the place.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;
