We periodically meet chief scientists with the various Departments on a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">getting</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">-to-know-you basis. In fact, I was meeting last night with two of your colleagues—one from the Home Office and one from DEFRA—so there is quite a free-flowing dialogue between Parliament and the chief scientists, which we welcome. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Before we get to the meat of the discussion, I want to ask you a question stemming from the exchange that I had with the Foreign Secretary on the Floor of the House yesterday. It is somewhat of a parochial matter, in that it affects my constituency and Stephen Mosley’s. I refer to the proposal that Veolia Environmental Services Ltd undertake the destruction of some chemical weapons stocks from </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Syria</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. It is a very simple question: are you satisfied that the procedures that are in place are sufficiently robust for us to be able to say to our constituents that there is no additional risk to them, other than those presented by living around a chemical complex?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Grimes</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The short answer to that is that I am entirely satisfied that the processes, protocols and safety issues are in place. The materials that we are going to be receiving in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> are the so-called B chemicals. In order to make an agent that is used in warfare, A chemicals are added to B chemicals, which actually make the agent. The first thing is that they have separated out those two components, and the B</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">chemicals are the ones that we are taking. On their own, they are not in the range of chemical weapons materials.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The second thing is that those B chemicals are ones with which the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is used to dealing. We use them in a range of different chemical processes, including pharmaceuticals. We are also used to taking them, dealing with the left-over products and incinerating them, indeed at </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Ellesmere Port</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, so the health and safety issues and everything are in place.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Actually, can I say that I think it sends a very positive message that the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is in a position that we can routinely and easily deal with these sorts of materials?

There are lots of different issues, certainly around climate change, in trying to get our agenda forward internationally, which I think is important. In generic terms, having science increasing up the agenda, and the Foreign Office pushing that agenda, is very important. I am passionately keen that we are able to really use our strengths academically, industrially and in terms of our national labs, to further our national position.

There is the departmental plan, which is part of an overall FCO plan, and we have contributed to that. We are in the process, as you heard, of filling those positions and so forth, so yes, I feel very confidently able to say we are doing that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There is also the Government Office for Science plan, which also made suggestions about expanding what we were doing—people and so forth—and making people more aware within the FCO, and all of that is wound into that as well.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q8 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">David </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tredinnick</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Notwithstanding what you are saying, which is very positive, the Foreign Office departmental improvement plan makes no mention of a science and innovation strategy for the Department.

It has to be up front and central in that planning, but this is a process that we are in at the moment. We are making progress. We have come a long way already, but I must say I am taking very much the long-term view of trying to infiltrate science into the FCO.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q9 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">David </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tredinnick</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I certainly get the feeling intuitively, listening to you, that science has been like Mars to the Earth as far as the Foreign Office is concerned; it is something it has never really looked at.

I would point to the science and innovation network, which I think is an outstanding organisation and one with which I dealt before I came to the FCO. Indeed, it was one of the reasons why I was keen to apply for the job in the first place. That is telling you that scientists generally out there are proud to be called to go and do work with the FCO. There is a push from the science end to the FCO, and we have the science and innovation network, which is supported very robustly by the FCO, particularly at post.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q10 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">David </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tredinnick</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Finally, diplomacy is really a lot about feel, is it not? Do you think that under these new arrangements the FCO is moving towards being a more evidence-based organisation, or is it still about looking people in the eye across the table and making decisions as the main way of doing it?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Grimes</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: In the end, you are right. You have to have people who have the experience and have come through the diplomatic system so that they can look you in the eye and make those sorts of decisions, often when dealing with quite difficult issues. I think science plays a part in that, and there is a greater realisation that science plays a part in that, by </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">being something that is sometimes easier to discuss. In post, people are understanding better how to use science, and that means that they are looking at the evidence and they are understanding how to look at scientific evidence more.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The Foreign Office has always been interested in evidence, in so far as I can tell you that in my 10 months there.

From my point of view, science diplomacy is two things. It is the use of science to further our national aims, but it is also the use of diplomacy to promote our science, so it goes both ways. One of the nice things about science diplomacy is that it does benefit both sides and it is clear how it benefits both sides.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q12 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Graham Stringer:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I will come back to that in a second.

If I was thinking about engaging with one of the emerging powers through this fund, I would be interested to think about what a particular country’s interests scientifically were, whether or not it had the infrastructure to do that science, and what difference the science that we would be doing with it would make. I am interested in increasing the UK scientists working with the scientists in that country, developing those ties and, for example, increasing the number of research projects leading to research publications, which lead in to new discoveries jointly with those countries for the benefit of both countries; but remember that this is an ODA fund, not primarily for the advantage of the UK.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q14 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Graham Stringer:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You are a scientist.

One of those obviously is the number of peer-</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">reviewed publications, but of course that in itself is difficult because there are journals and journals, and you want to aim for the ones that will have the biggest impact internationally. You are looking at the number of PhD students, for example—I am talking very broadly here—that you are able to train. Again, you want to be supporting and building the country you are developing with, as well as supporting and developing your own country in that regard. There are different metrics, and you have to look at them quite carefully.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q15 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Graham Stringer:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Is there a metric of benefit to this country?

I would point to the fact that there was a great Royal Society report in 2012, which was able to demonstrate clearly that the impact that publications emanating from international collaboration have, in terms of their citations, was much better. If you are collaborating internationally, your science has more impact; it is better received by the international community; and it leads to more things, so you can measure that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q16 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Pamela Nash:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Professor Grimes, I wanted to know a bit about how you find suddenly being in the realms of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Whitehall</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, coming from an academic background.

Obviously, some of them were about practical things like security issues and so on and so forth, and some were about trying to understand the structure of the FCO. I think the FCO have very good training courses. A lot of the things are available to a lot of people. They are quite nice, because you also meet a whole range of people from the FCO. Those courses are not just for director generals; when you go to them you see everybody.

I did a joint thing with him in India on one of the trips that he and I were both on, and I see that increasing with time, as I am understanding what it is that a scientist does to help a Minister and what a Minister does to help.

This goes back to the issue that scientists who come on these events are extremely proud to be called upon by the FCO. I want to see the science and innovation network make more use of their enthusiasm. We sometimes do not appreciate the extent to which they would like to do more and develop reports, which can then go into wider circulation. We had a great example recently from </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Malaysia</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> where the science and innovation officer there helped scientists in an event to do with fisheries and agriculture.

Reading the literature is, of course, the traditional way that scientists have gained an understanding, but reading the literature is at least 18 months behind the thinking of those people.

In a situation like that, that would probably occur through a science advisory group for emergencies—a SAGE request. I sit on SAGE. If there was a specific emergency, then I would be able to go.
