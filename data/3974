To increase further the effectiveness of select committees, further attention could be given to the skills, training and knowledge of committee members; the quality and tone of questioning; the training and preparation of witnesses; and to the role and leadership of the Chair in improving effectiveness of the committee as a whole. </span><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">What leads to a more effective session?</span><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="3" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Ingredients for a successful inquiry appear to include well briefed, well informed committee members who are skilled at asking follow up questions</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">which build on pre-set questions; effective committee members are able to respond flexibly in light of the evidence presented.

Training tailored to the individual, where the trainer and the committee member are able to review a video of sessions and analyse strengths or weaknesses and identify areas for improvement could prove particularly valuable.</span><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></li><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 31.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The leadership of the Chair is also important here. The tone is set by the Chair and he or she has a huge influence over the committee. It might be useful for the Chair to start by undertaking a review of the performance of the Committee and individual members; and assessing priorities for development .  </span><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; text-decoration:underline">Training for witnesses</span><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="10" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Good preparation for appearing before a Committee is very important and this may contain some specific training. But the focus of this should be on how best to answer the question, rather than how best to avoid answering it and instead communicate a previously agreed ‘line’. Using traditional media training as preparation for appearing before a select committee, while understandable, can lead to a less successful hearing, because it can use up large amounts of time unproductively and appear to frustrate the Committee and its members.</span><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">What can we do to help?</span></p><ol start="11" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The PCF has already run one session for its members on how to prepare for a successful appearance before a select committee.
