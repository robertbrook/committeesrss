font-size:12pt">prepared to commit themselves to the principle of not striking.  The union now has 32,000 members across all sectors of education (early years, primary, secondary and tertiary), including teachers, lecturers, school and college leaders, teaching assistants and other school support staff, nannies, nursery nurses, childcare and early years professionals, centrally employed staff working for Local Authorities in education or children’s services, students on teacher training or childcare courses, and self-employed tutors and consultants.  </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Formerly known as The Professional Association of Teachers, the union re-branded in February 2008 as Voice: the union for education professionals.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">  Independent of the Trades Union Congress and not affiliated to any political party, Voice prefers to use the force of argument rather than the argument of force and, as such, relies on the power of effective negotiation rather than resorting to strikes or any other form of industrial action.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';

font-size:12pt">.  As a trade union representing professionals working within education, Voice’s written submission is confined to those aspects of the draft Bill which pertain to education and employment, namely, clauses 1, 2, 3, 31, 32, 33 and 50, and associated schedules 1, 12, 13, 14 and 16 (part 7 only).</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';

font-size:12pt">Whilst we are sympathetic to the recommendations of the Richard Review and the need to review some of the overly prescriptive detail in the current legislation, we believe that revised legislation, rather than deregulation, is the better way to ensure that apprenticeship schemes are fit for purpose.  Apprenticeships operating under current regulations have been criticised for providing a poor training experience for many young people, which signifies a need to tighten, rather than relax, legislation in this area.  Given that apprentices receive a </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">minuscule wage of just £2.65 per hour, the proposal to make schemes more flexible and responsive to the needs of employers and the economy may, in practice, lead to apprentices being exploited to an even greater extent, with no recourse to any legal remedy.  We note that the changes will affect apprenticeship schemes in England, whilst leaving those in Wales untouched.  We are not convinced that separating the statutory requirements of English and Welsh apprenticeships will lead to improvements in either scheme.  Any differences which are introduced are likely to benefit one at the expense of the other, which cannot be equitable.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';

font-size:12pt">Over recent years, we have witnessed many examples where the duties and responsibilities of arms-length bodies have been taken over by the Secretary of State.  This has not always been healthy for democracy or for efficient administration, as it removes necessary checks and balances on the powers of the Secretary of State and leads to a growth and concentration of bureaucracy and power within ministerial departments such as the DfE and BIS.  Whilst we may disagree with many of the legislative changes introduced in the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009, we do not believe that devolving the powers introduced in that Act to the discretion of the Secretary of State will improve funding, efficiency or fairness in the further education and skills sector.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';

font-size:12pt">Schedule 13 is a mixed bag of legislative changes, many of which go far beyond minor administrative changes in areas which have become outdated.  Rather, some of the proposed changes could have far-reaching consequences, many of which may be unintended.  One example is the removal of the requirement for teachers and trainers in the further education sector to obtain a recognised teaching qualification.  We are concerned that this will de-skill and de-professionalise the education workforce and increase variability of standards and practice within the sector.  We are aware that this change has already been introduced through secondary legislation, which does not require a vote in parliament, and that the further proposals outlined in the Bill are designed to remove the underpinning primary legislation.  In general, we are opposed to the introduction of mechanisms by which the government can fast-track changes by the increased use of secondary legislation in the form of statutory instruments which can be initiated at the whim of a Secretary of State without recourse to parliamentary scrutiny or Royal Assent.  Another example of this in the draft Bill is the proposal to increase the powers of the Secretary of State to restrict the involvement of students in the governance of further and higher education institutions.  This is worrying as it further limits the extent to which such institutions need to be responsive to the very individuals </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';

font-size:12pt">We are concerned about the lack of accountability of headteachers if governing bodies (or academy trusts) are not involved in plans to promote good behaviour and discipline in schools.  Behaviour policies are fundamental to the success of a school.  They should be whole school and community-based, with no short-cuts in drawing up, developing, monitoring and sustaining them.  Whilst there may be many example of poor practice, where the headteacher submits a policy to the governors, who give their assent, best practice is where there is full involvement and commitment of the whole governing body in initiating and designing policy.  Leaving such an important aspect of school life to the headteacher may isolate the headteacher from the governing body, reduce accountability and open the door to mavericks.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';

font-size:12pt">There have been numerous difficulties with enforcing home-school agreements, particularly with ensuring that the parental declaration is signed by all parents and that legal sanctions are fully enacted.  We, therefore, welcome the flexibility which the proposed changes will give to schools.  Promoting good relations between schools and parents involves developing relationships of mutual trust.  </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Shoving a ‘contract’ under parents’ noses</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> seldom helps.  Our headteacher members have personal experience of being involved with exclusion panels where much time has been wasted poring over the minutiae of the home-school agreement, an activity which had no effect on the outcome.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';
