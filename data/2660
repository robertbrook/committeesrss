Threats to security involve information about what is happening on the ground in other countries; the evaluation of that information; and the choice of a response. The UK and the US have common interests in monitoring threats to their national security from third countries and from non-state terrorist organisations.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">*Ergo, there are positive incentives to maintain the long tradition of collaboration between UK and US security agencies. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">2.2 The UK is distinctive in the size and diversity of its population that has active links with countries where terrorist organisations such as al-Qaeda operate and in having British-based Islamists who recruit British citizens to collaborate with such organisations. Moreover, these terrorists sometimes plan actions directed against American targets. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">*Ergo the trans-national nature of many terrorist activities today gives both the United States and the UK an incentive to maintain intelligence cooperation.

Interpretation based on imperfect information is subject to speculation reflecting beliefs that are open to dispute. Both information and assumptions were misleading in the evaluation of Iraq. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">*Ergo, it is the British interest that the interpretation given intelligence information be determined in London and then compared with the outcome of a parallel process in Washington, where American beliefs and opinions are unlikely to be identical. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">2.5 There are always choices between acting or not acting and between different forms of action. The logic of a coalition of the willing is that a country may be unwilling to participate in an action that the US government has decided to take. The Vietnam War is an example of the UK opting out of an American military commitment. The information used by the Prime Minister to justify the choice of going to war in Iraq paid more attention to Washington than to scrutiny in Cabinet and Parliament. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">*Ergo, it is in the British interest that the full Cabinet and Parliament treat security information as an object for scrutiny and debate before any major security intervention is taken. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">3.1 MILITARY STRENGTH.

The United Kingdom lacks the population resources to be a major power on other continents. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">*Ergo, the UK’s major contribution to military action is political, confirming its commitment to alliances such as NATO and providing multi-national support for decisions made in Washington. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">3.2 The limited military contribution that Britain can make to American-led military operations gives it limited influence on operations in the field.

The collective European interest in such problems makes it appropriate to act with other European countries. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">*Ergo, it is in the UK interest to promote political and military cooperation within the European region. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">III OUTSIDE THE TRANS-ATLANTIC AREA</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">4.1 In the United States, ASIA is now the primary referent, a marked shift away from the European focus of the Cold War era. America approaches Asia by heading west to China. In Britain the approach is to head east to the Indian sub-continent. In each country, immigration re-enforces these contrasting approaches.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">*Ergo, policymakers should be explicit about which “Asia” is being referred to. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">4.2 CHINA is a military power that the United States has forces to counter that the UK lacks.
