Additionally, the Environment and Public Health Committee of the European Parliament recently voted against adopting </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">measures</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> on standardised packaging in the revision of the European Tobacco Products Directive.

It is vital that this problem is not exacerbated through ineffective policies such as standardised packaging. Additionally such a measure is likely to create a problem of cross border smuggling within the UK. A wider issue the Committee may wish to consider is whether or not the Scottish Government has the power to legislate for these measures.</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; margin:0pt 0pt 16.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">As operational targets for tobacco seizure have been missed in 2012-13, priority should instead be given to growing activity and regul</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">ation against the illicit trade to avoid undermining the progress already made by the Government and legitimate retailers to lower the number </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">of smokers and to ensure that underage children cannot</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> access these products</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> Illicit traders target those living in lower-income areas, particularly children, who are not only attracted by the lower price of illicit products, but also by the</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> ease of access to them, owing to a</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> lack of age restriction enforced by this market. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">  </span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; margin:0pt 0pt 16.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Why Border Force failed to meet its operational targets for tobacco seizure in 2012–13</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; margin:0pt 0pt 16.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Although HMRC has made significant progress in tackling the illicit trade at UK borders, the lack of focus on the growth of</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> volume crime</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> on the ground in communities has meant that inland illicit activity has been able to thrive </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">in our most vulnerable communities, and has contributed to the failure of HMRC t</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">o reach its operational targets in 2012-13. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> </span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; margin:0pt 0pt 16.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">This is evident from HMRC’s own statistics on prosecutions. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The proportion of prosecutions for inland seizures compared with those on the border and overseas is extremely low, and targets have also been missed in this area. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> For instance, o</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">nly 5% of cigarettes seized in 2010-2011 and 14% of Hand Rolling Tobacco were seized inland</span><a name="_ftnref1"></a><a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">.</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; margin:0pt 0pt 16.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Government-led responsibility for ta</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">ckling smuggling lies with HMRC; however</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> local agencies have the network and the people to identify illegal tobacco sales in the community</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">, particularly in the case of low-level volume crime</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">.

SGF’s members have on the whole been very positive about the register – they are willing to be seen as responsible and legitimate retailers. A key factor in the high levels of registration is that there is no charge attached to registering and it can be done through a fairly simple on-line proce</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">ss.</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; margin:0pt 0pt 16.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">There are serious consequences for retailers who are not in compliance with the new smoking legislation. The Tobacco and Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Act 2010 gives powers to Trading Standard Officers to issue fixed penalty notices for offences, including selling tobacco to under 18s and not being on the Retailer Register. If a retailer is found to be in breach of tobacco sales legislation three times within a two year period, a Local Authority can apply to the courts to have the retai</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">ler banned from selling tobacco.</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; margin:0pt 0pt 16.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">For the first time under tobacco sales laws, those found to be selling tobacco illicitly by not being on the Register can be fined up to £20,000 and sent to prison for six months. Scotland is the only nation of the UK to have such a scheme in place. The registration scheme gives a wider range of tools to Trading Standards which will help them in enforcing age restriction laws. However, we have a concern that offences against the scheme are not being prosecuted with sufficient force</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> possibly due to a lack of resources on the ground as public spending continues to be cut back.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Our understanding is that in 2011-2012 there were no prosecution for offences relating to the Register.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 16.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">As with our colleagues from </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">ACS</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">, we believe</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> that current sanctions against tobacco smugglers, particularly those who operate on the ground within communities, are not strong enough and do not target the correct people.
