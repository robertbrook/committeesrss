To take one case, we sought to establish the financial consequences of the Government’s decision to relax planning control on some extensions to the rear of dwellings and then to modify its proposals by instituting a "light-touch" review where neighbours objected. On the two occasions on which we examined the proposals the Government's estimates of additional construction and of savings to families had changed significantly. The revised figure for additional construction was also based on a 1970s study of US house-purchasing behaviour, and overall the department’s impact assessment was inadequate. The assessment of the financial impact on local authorities’ planning departments, which were deprived of a significant amount of planning fees by the changes but were expected to run the new light-touch regime, was speculative and lacked corroborative detail. </span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 21.68pt; padding-left:6.67pt; page-break-after:avoid; page-break-inside:avoid; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">The Committee has had cause to be concerned about both the timing and quality of Government responses to its reports.
