In June 2013, a number of my constituents became the first re</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">sidents in Britain to be given specialist training to stop people committing suicide on railway lines near their homes. They were shown how to recognise certain signs of strangers who may be about to kill themselves- and how best to stop them jumping in f</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">r</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">ont of trains. It was a course delivered by the Samaritans after a number of people in the area have been killed by trains over the past 18months.
