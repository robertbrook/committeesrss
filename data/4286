Phosphate and potash are both in finite supply in the long-term and whilst nitrogen can be manufactured, the process requires natural gas which in turn exposes the industry to fluctuations in supply and price in addition to the environmental and energy security impacts. Agriculture has reduced consumption of manufactured fertiliser in the last 20-30 years and farmers are recycling nutrients from both the agriculture sector and wider industry. The British Survey of Fertiliser Practices shows the declining trend in fertiliser nutrient applications between 1990 and 2012 with nitrogen applications in England and Wales down by 30%, phosphate applications down by 57% and potash down by 55%. Farmers are also improving use of organic fertiliser sources such as manures, biosolids, composts and digestates as alternative sources of nutrients and organic matter. Further skills and technology which optimise fertiliser usage, will help the industry to continue to improve nutrient use efficiency and sustainable cycling of nutrients, while ensuring that productivity is maintained or improved.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 72pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">c)</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The British farming industry is therefore acutely aware of the need to have a durable plan for </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">energy</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> security, yet the sector also has the potential to be a net exporter of energy.

The three key costs of production are feed, fuel and fertiliser. Higher cereals and oilseeds prices, for example, lead to increases in animal feed costs. Meanwhile, the correlation between agriculture and energy markets has increased through the global expansion of biofuels. In addition, we have seen the development of some pricing mechanisms that take into account shifting input costs. A feed price ‘ratchet’ is increasingly commonplace in broiler chicken contracts. Dedicated retailer supply groups in the dairy sector have developed models that take account of changes in </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">production costs</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">. However, time lags are the norm and local supply and demand dynamics can be significant. Higher prices</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> do not necessarily translate to increased farm viability. Farm business income fell 32% in real terms for the average farm in 2012/13, despite strong commodity prices, indicating that the links between production costs and output prices is far from immediate or proportionate.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="14" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The relationship between the prices farmers receive for their outputs and retail prices for food are more complex. The FAO’s food price index has fallen since April 2013 yet food prices continue to increase in the UK. Raw materials are only one cost in the food supply chain, therefore tempering the impact of commodity price rises at the retail level. Packing, transportation and energy costs have all </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">added upwards pressure in recent years.

This makes us particularly vulnerable to the volatile price movements that have characterised commodity markets since 2007. Indeed, some of the food categories that have witnessed higher food inflation are those where we are more reliant on international supplies. It is now apparent that the food price spike of 2007/8 was not a unique event with some food businesses and countries taking a fresh approach to securing long-term food supplies. Similarly, shoppers are questioning the provenance of their food following the discovery of horsemeat in processed meat products, whilst food affordability remains a key driver for many shoppers. The result has been the renewed interest in food security issues.  </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="16" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">In the short term, UK spending power on world markets makes it unlikely that the UK will fail to secure supplies on international markets and</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> we will turn to the international market for a proportion of our food needs.

A forthcoming review funded by the HGCA will assess the likely economic and environmental impact of genetically modified cereals and oilseeds for UK agriculture and add to the analysis of GM’s potential benefits.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="20" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">However, there are serious problems with the EU regulatory system. The Government’s Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) published three reports in August 2013 looking at the EU regulatory framework for GMOs. It concluded that the current system is not evidence-based or scientifically justified; is out of step with good regulatory practice; is slow and expensive; and does not encourage innovation. The NFU is concerned that Europe is being left behind and becoming less competitive as the rest of the world rapidly adopts this technology. This means that companies are discouraged from investing in the EU, exemplified by BASF Plant Science moving its headquarters to the US in January 2012 and Monsanto ceasing to seek approvals for new biotech crops in Europe in July 2013. The regulatory and protection costs are so great that public sector science is severely limited in terms of taking an event through the pipeline from discovery to commercialisation. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">How food and farming supply chains, and the current systems for traceability,</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">can contribute to increased resilience.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="21" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Traceability issues from production to consumption are critical matters for farmers.

We also need to create a positive legislative environment supporting the agri-food sector so farmers are resilient and able to deal effectively with the future; changing and unpredictable weather patterns, market volatility and resulting price fluctuations. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="background-color:#ffff00; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">10</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:7.33pt; vertical-align:super">th</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> December 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0.5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0.5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">              </span></p></div><hr style="width:33%; height:1px; text-align:left" /><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn1"></a><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt"> The Future of Food And Farming, Government Office for Science, 2011</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn2"></a><a href="#_ftnref2">[2]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt"> </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/green-food-project-conclusions"><span style="color:#0000ff; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt; text-decoration:underline">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/green-food-project-conclusions</span></a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn3"></a><a href="#_ftnref3">[3]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt"> </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-climate-change-risk-assessment-government-report"><span style="color:#0000ff; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt; text-decoration:underline">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-climate-change-risk-assessment-government-report</span></a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn4"></a><a href="#_ftnref4">[4]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">Foresight Internation</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">al Dimensions of Climate Change, 2011.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn5"></a><a href="#_ftnref5">[5]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">International threats and opportunities of climate change to the UK</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">.
