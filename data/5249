We hope that this year will not simply be in support of maintaining the status quo; we would like to see positive action in the Palestinians having their own independent Palestinian state. As far as the Palestinians are concerned, we have been committed to the peace process for the past 20 years. As a matter of fact, we have accepted so many concessions, starting with the acceptance of the state of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> over 78% of the Palestinian historic territory, and so far there has been no acknowledgement of our nationhood or our statehood from the Israeli side. We want this peace process to succeed because we gain much, as Palestinians, from its success, for the simple fact that we could fulfil our national aspirations of having our independent state over 22% of historic </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Palestine</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. Yet we are the ones who could really set a precedent for security, not only in our part of the world but in the entire </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Middle East</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> region.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We still do not know what </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’s agenda is as long as it does not recognise Palestinian nationhood, and we are not really clear about </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’s position in the peace process. We have seen preconditions coming into the actual, real negotiations, sponsored by the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. Secretary of State John Kerry is putting his whole heart into making this a success story. The Palestinian side has been very co-operative with Mr Kerry in making it a success story. However, we have not seen the Israelis after almost 20 rounds of talks; we are still just vacillating between borders and security and trying more or less to agree on semantics—what kind of security and borders we are talking about. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We do not have the maps that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> wants really to share with us. We went there with the idea that the 1967 borders are the borders for a two-state solution in which two democracies could live side by side. So far I can say that the peace process is being stalled by the impediments being put by </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and by the continuing Israeli settlements—the building of settlements. The </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">latest was a couple of days ago. Prime Minister </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Netanyahu</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has daringly announced that they will build another 1,400 units. Since 30 July last year, when we embarked on this new peace process, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has pledged to build more than 6,400 units on the West Bank and in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">East Jerusalem</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. Those are signs of a lack of commitment to the peace process as far as </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is concerned. They are negative signs to our side that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is not serious about peace.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Thank you.

That is why the Palestinians are taking these negotiations very seriously. We have been very co-operative with Mr Kerry. It is not only that the President is in direct contact with Mr Kerry, let alone the negotiating team, but I have managed to attend a couple of meetings with Mr Kerry. We have portrayed to him the total commitment of the Palestinians to non-violence with diplomatic efforts. We want the peace process to succeed and to have an independent Palestinian state. We have to finish with this occupation once and for all. We do not need crisis management. We want an end of conflict and an end of claims.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q3</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What are the implications if the talks do not succeed?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Hassassian</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The implications are many. First of all, the strategy of the Palestinians has always been a commitment to non-violence, so we are going to pursue our aims through non-violent means.

We know through our private channels that the British Government have been working closely with Secretary of State Kerry and the American Administration in trying to push for a resolution to the conflict through peaceful efforts. Time and again we have heard Foreign Secretary William Hague saying that this is the last chance for a two-state solution. If we go to the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">West Bank</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> today, we see that it is </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">divided into four major cantons with no geographical continuity. With the building of the apartheid wall, with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Gaza</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> being totally separated and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Jerusalem</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> being isolated, there is no way that we could have our politically independent Palestinian state with this non-contiguous geographic entity, let alone with the building of settlements. It is not an encouragement to resolve this deal once and for all. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Going back to the question of the British Government, I think the British Government has been very committed to the peace process, and it has been very committed to helping Palestinian infrastructure development as well as promoting business with the Palestinians.

As you are aware, there are proposals on the table from Secretary of State Kerry and the Quartet representative Tony Blair to secure something like $4 billion in investment for the Palestinians. Is it possible to make economic progress before a political breakthrough? If so, how important is it? Where does this fit into the big scheme of things? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Hassassian</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> This is a philosophical question: which comes first, the chicken or the egg? We have many differences over the issues of whether economic stability will bring political resolution to any kind of conflict. Or vice versa—if we have a political resolution then the economic development will basically pave the way towards more settlement, security and stability in the area. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It is important in our case that we should continually have economic development and try to secure that. The major problem today facing the Palestinian Authority is unemployment, as you know. I just came back from the West Bank three days ago and—my goodness gracious—the consumer goods in the West Bank are more expensive than in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. Would you believe that? We talk about a per capita income ratio of one to almost 20, and we buy our goods basically from </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.

But I would not say that it will be enough basically to maintain the status quo. We need to change the realities on the ground.

I see that the British are there not as full partners in the political process. They are much more involved in paying the cheques rather than in playing an important role in the peace process itself politically. But yet we never undervalued the role of the British Government in putting pressures—low profile and discreetly—with the Americans through their own recommendations, let alone their tough position, especially on the issue of settlements. The British Government have been very outspoken on the question of the illegality of building Israeli settlements. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That is very encouraging for us as Palestinians, but we need the British Government to play a little bit more effectively on the political scene. They could put pressures on the Americans, for example, to put aside the question of the Jewish state. Let’s put those issues aside and deal with them at the end of the political process. The problem has always been the process and not the substance. Both parties know exactly what the endgame will be and what the political solution will be. Our problem has always been the process.

That is number one. East Jerusalem and West Jerusalem should be part of an open city and the holy sites should be open to all faiths from all over the world, but if </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> decides to separate the city, the eastern part would be under our control and the western part would be under its control. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">At Camp David, we accepted the fact that the Wailing Wall and the Jewish quarter would be ceded to the state of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> as part of the continuation of the holy sites and religious rituals.

The refugees have been </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">given meaningful options here. This is coming not only from my side as a Palestinian; it has also been discussed in the second-track negotiations.

Third is naturalisation in host countries, and many of them have been naturalised. For example, our refugees in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Jordan</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> hold Jordanian citizenship. In </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Syria</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, they hold Syrian identity cards.

It is in no position to make a political bargain, except accepting that the only way is to reconcile with Fatah and accepting the outcome of the negotiations. Hamas has no other choices. The military option for Hamas is no option at all. By the way, it is not Hamas that is instigating rockets against </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: there are some Islamic jihadists, al-Qaeda members and extreme fundamentalists, which Hamas no longer controls in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Gaza</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. They are the sources of tension now.

It is a pleasure to be here. Perhaps I will make a couple of very brief opening comments.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Anyone who thinks about our region at the moment, and through the two years that I have been here, has to approach it with a fair amount of humility, and we need humility at a number of different levels. We have been taught again and again how much we can actually know about what is going on in the countries of the region, how much we can actually analyse what it is that we know and, most of all, how much we can actually influence our neighbouring countries, which are going through a period of upheaval such that you would probably have to go back more than 100 years to find anything remotely similar. But even during this period, when things are playing themselves out and we are finding that the old order in many of these countries is both more fragile and more resistant or resilient than we imagined, there are one or two insights that might help us when we come closer to home.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">If I had to point out just two of them, the first is that when it comes to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’s conflict, particularly with our Palestinian neighbours, we need to resolve it because we need to resolve it, but we should not delude ourselves that resolving our conflict will be the core of resolving all of the issues in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Middle East</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. For many years, that has been a dogma for a lot of people approaching our region. We have enough on our shoulders as it is.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The second thing is that if we look at all the different conflicts in our region, one of the things they have in common is that hardly any of them are territorial. They are ideological, tribal, generational, but not territorial. That invites us to look a little more closely at the conflict that we are involved in to see whether it is simply a territorial conflict. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Clearly, our conflict has a territorial dimension, and clearly a territorial compromise will be a part of any solution, but I think that it is a mistake to imagine that simply addressing territorial dimensions will actually resolve a conflict. I think one of the things that Israelis have realised is that we are talking about a conflict with roots that run much deeper—in some quarters, we are talking about a simple, fundamental opposition to the idea of the Jewish people having a homeland in this part of the world. Unless we address that, it will be very difficult to achieve a lasting solution. Those are my opening remarks. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q23</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Thank you, ambassador. Can I point out that we have half an hour and a lot of questions, so brevity in answers would be appreciated? As far as the current negotiations are concerned, John Kerry said there was a sense of urgency about this. Do you think this is the last-chance saloon for a two-state solution?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">His Excellency Daniel </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Taub</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We certainly agree that there is urgency and a desire for peace. If you look at the Israeli public, you will see something very interesting. The statistics show that, today in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, you have a larger majority that supports significant, generous concessions for peace—territorial concessions—to create a two-state solution than ever before in the history of the state of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. And yet the same statistics show that the Israeli public is more sceptical about the chances of reaching that peace than it has been at any time over the past 65 years. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I think there are two reasons for that. The first reason is that we are talking about a public which has tragically been burned. It has seen twice, over the past decade, territory handed over to neighbours in an attempt to reach peace or stability with them and in both cases we have </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">seen the territory that was given back—whether in south </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Lebanon</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> or </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Gaza</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—turning into launching pads for thousands of missiles that have been fired into the heart of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. Yesterday we saw the surprising, shocking spectacle at the funeral of Ariel Sharon, who pulled 9,000 Israelis out of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Gaza</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, of missiles being fired from the areas that he pulled out of. This is something that Israelis are aware of: the danger that the area that we pull out of will not be a force for peace, but a basis for continuing the conflict. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The second reason, I think, why Israelis are sceptical, unfortunately, is that at the moment it does not seem like we are working with a partner that is able or prepared to grapple with the real nub of the conflict. To have a statement by President </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Abbas</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> this week that continues, 65 years later, still to reject the partition resolution that talks about a Jewish state and a Palestinian state; to insist on what is called a right of return for Palestinian refugees, which would be the end of the two-state solution—those are the reasons why Israelis, unfortunately, are sceptical at the moment. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q24</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What would be the implications if the negotiations do not succeed?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">His Excellency Daniel </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Taub</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The focus of our attention at the moment is to do everything we possibly can in order to make them succeed. In fact, that is the reason why we are doing things today which previously would have been considered impossible or unconscionable for Israelis. You are talking to me at a time when </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has just released the third tranche of brutal murderers. There are no other words for it: these are people who were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment because they had deliberately killed innocent women and children and men, and they are being released into a society where the families of the victims are witnessing them go free, expressing no regret for their actions. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The only reason why </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is doing that is that we realise that we need to give this particular round of negotiations everything that we possibly can. Our partner has said that that is what is necessary for them to stay at the negotiating table. If that is the case, as painful as it is, that is what we are prepared to do. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q25</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir John Stanley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Ambassador, how satisfied—or not—is the Israeli Government with the role and policies that have been pursued by the British Government in trying to get meaningful discussions under way between the Israelis and the Palestinians? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">His Excellency Daniel </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Taub</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> First of all, thank you, Sir John, for the question. We are enormously appreciative of all the support that has been given to the current process. William Hague, the Foreign Secretary, has spoken very highly of, and been very supportive of, John Kerry in getting the negotiations on track. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Having said that, there are a number of things that could be done that might help to contribute to making negotiations more effective. One is that there is a need to keep the centre of gravity at the negotiation table. One of the things that is most damaging to the negotiations is the sense that there is a magnetic attraction away from them. For example, one of the things that is very problematic for the negotiations is the sense that the Palestinians constantly have one eye on either the United Nations or other international organisations as an alternative track to try to get political achievements. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The fact is that there have been decades of resolutions against </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in the United Nations, and they have not changed the situation on the ground for Palestinians. What has changed the situation on the ground for Palestinians are a few short years of negotiations that resulted in a situation where 98% of Palestinians voted for a Palestinian council that they elected themselves. If we are going to get further down that track we have to keep the centre of gravity at the negotiating table, which is why resolutions, initiatives and international organisations, in our view, probably play a counter-productive role in moving us forward. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q26</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir John Stanley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you think that the British Government have been as proactive as the Israeli Government would have wished in trying to get a meaningful negotiation under way?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">His Excellency Daniel </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Taub</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The British Government have made a number of different contributions.

We think that is very important, in order to try to paint a very clear picture for the peoples of the region of what a post-peace future could look like for them and to try to incentivise peace in that way. Those are positive directions. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q27</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mike Gapes:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Ambassador, you have said that, despite the scepticism and the experience of the past years, the Israeli Government decided last year to go back to the negotiating table.

The fact is that if you think about Israeli society, we are talking about a society that is paying a price for not having peace on a daily basis. Last year, we had 1,277 terrorist attacks or attempted attacks in the West Bank alone—that is not even talking about the vast number of missiles that have been fired from the Gaza strip, the tunnels that we have discovered going from the Gaza strip under Israel in an attempt to blow up Israeli villages or kidnap soldiers, and so on. We are talking about a society where every young man and woman has to serve three or two years of army service and then a month a year of army reserve duty. We are talking about a situation where if you simply look economically, the benefits of the synergy between an Israeli economy and a Palestinian economy that were working in peace next to each other would be enormous.

If we can hold fast to the realisation that we have fundamental strategic interests in common, that could actually be a help in moving us forwards towards a peaceful arrangement.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q29</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mike Gapes:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So there is a relationship between your security concerns about </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Middle East</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> peace process?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">His Excellency Daniel </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Taub</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think all these things are related, but those are particularly related because we have </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> deliberately playing an extremely negative role in training, supporting and funding the fundamentalist organisations and elements that have tried to destroy prospects for peace in the region.

I say this as a negotiator: it is not possible to talk about territorial issues without addressing the security issues in some way, because what you are able to do in relation to territory very much depends on whether you have a presence, a protective force or some other kind of arrangement in another area, and you simply cannot talk about one thing in the absence of another.

The fact is that today we have the establishment of a Palestinian state as being part of the Government’s manifesto.

There is a phrase that Israelis sometimes use: “an umbrella which melts in the rain.” That phrase sometimes comes to mind when one describes the record of international forces when push comes to shove. Israel has never asked anybody else to defend its citizens, but if we are going to move towards a situation in which Israel will have a narrow waist—where there will be a significant territorial withdrawal—there needs to be some basic elements to try to ensure that what has happened in Gaza and south Lebanon, and what is even beginning to happen in Sinai, does not happen in large areas of land that are close to the centre of the Israeli population.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q33</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir Menzies Campbell:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> A moment or two ago, Ambassador, I interpreted you as expressing some optimism, heavily qualified, about the possible outcome of an agreement with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.

First, when you are offering support, no party in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Middle East</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is monolithic. One of the questions that you need to ask yourselves is “Who are we strengthening and who are we weakening in the way that we provide this support?” One of the areas where there has been improvement, although it could be that additional improvement is required, is that in the past aid, support and funds have gone to those aspects of Palestinian society that are not the most peace minded and are not the ones that are trying to reach out and accommodate but that, in many cases, have actually tried to subvert the chances for peace.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The other point I would make is slightly more general. I think that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Britain</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and the international community, and we Israelis as well, probably need to change the way that we talk about peace. In an extraordinarily complicated arena, we talk about peace in our corner as though it turns out to be a rather simplistic approach and a rather utopian ideal. The fact is that that is not the case. The fact is that, when peace comes, it is going to be a very complicated peace. If I look at peace resolutions that have taken place in the modern era around the world—in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Cyprus</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, in former </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Yugoslavia</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and so on—they have been complicated and messy agreements. I went with one of my Palestinian counterparts in the negotiations to see the situation in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Northern Ireland</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, so many years after the Good Friday agreement. What was most inspiring to us was not seeing how easy it was to make peace, but seeing how hard it was to make peace and how hard it was to keep it alive. In a very profound way, it made this peace seem realistic to us. It made it seem tangible to us. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q44</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Roy:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Ambassador, on that same analogy, surely it was right for the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United Kingdom</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> to offer support at a grass-roots level.

To have the states of the Arab League saying, “We are not prepared to play this role; we are simply going to sit on the sidelines until somehow or other all the problems have been resolved,” is unfortunate.

The Palestinians might embark on the third intifada. I think that it has already started. I think the historians, looking back, will say that the third Palestinian intifada started in 2012, 2013. It is different. It is not the first intifada, which was quite organised, and it is not the second intifada, which involved suicide bombers, but there are random, sporadic attacks in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Occupied</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Territories</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> proper.

They will not be celebrating peace. They will, in a sense, be feeling rather grim and humiliated that they have had to capitulate to something that they cannot be proud of and that will not end the conflict for refugees around the region. On the Israeli side, my perception is that, whereas once there was a conscience among most Israelis that they did not want to be party to an occupation and to the suppression of other people’s rights, I sense now that it is more common to find an attitude that simply says, “The Jews historically have had the most appalling treatment. Life is not fair. You guys get used to it.”</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sayigh</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I guess a lot depends on just what is in any framework agreement or deal, if there is one. A lot also depends on just what the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in particular, and to a significant degree the EU, and in general the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, provide in the form of political oversight for the implementation, and on what sort of substance they give the whole process. That means that if there is just enough in a framework agreement, even if it is overall a modest package that is backed by the political will to see the process through—we have not see that sort of will before, so I am already casting some doubt—there is some hope of going forward with that in the West Bank, although not necessarily in Gaza. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">However, I am not hopeful that we will start seeing that sort of political leadership from the EU</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">or the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in particular.

There is a high level of cynicism and fatigue among Palestinians over a number of different issues, including their own divisions, which means that the scope for mass mobilisation and confrontation is not very high.

The British can say, “We will help you to protect the border from the Jordanian side of the river. We know the Jordanians and we will work with the Americans to help you there.” The Israelis would also like to see a deal that is bigger than an Israeli-Palestinian deal. Perhaps you can help to mobilise other Arab countries in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Middle East</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> to support the Palestinians. Some of the issues are not in the hands of the Palestinian leadership.

In so far as they were quite vigorous about Palestinian rights for a period in the mid-20th century, it had to do with the perspective of a number of people at the Foreign Office. I would say that the most logical position that the British came up with, which they were driving inside the EU up until the beginning of the Blair Government, was to be careful about how you make a peace deal. If it utterly ignores international law and gives the Palestinians the absolute minimum, it is likely not to be a good peace. In other words, the more land, the more peace. The more that this is something that can be celebrated, the more it will last. The more that it is stingy, non-liberating, certainly not sovereign and certainly barely contiguous and so on, the less it is a sustainable peace.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Now, as of the Blair Governments, the British have essentially recognised that there is not a great deal that they can do. They defer to the Americans. The British position, up until John Kerry’s initiative, was essentially: “The parties must talk to each other directly. That will sort it, and the only player that can make them do that is the Americans”. So, it is playing second fiddle to the Americans; it is not really feeling any sense of agency or even any sense of vision of to what would work better as opposed to worse.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sayigh</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I would agree with what Dr Hollis has just said. I will take one instance where I think Her Majesty’s Government could have done something differently. This was about a year and a half ago, when the Palestinians went to the United Nations—not the first time, when they went to the Security Council, but the second time, when they went to the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">General Assembly—for the request to become a non-member state. The Europeans were allowed a free vote, and most European countries voted in favour. A few abstained, one of them being, of course, the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United Kingdom</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That was an instance when the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> could have delivered a different kind of political message—one that, frankly, would have had very little material impact on the ground, but which would have been very important demonstratively. It would have said: “We are unquestionably committed to Palestinian statehood”. This was going to be non-member status—it was bound and limited and was going to pass anyway, and other Europeans took that step. That is one little example of where the British did not need to be in the lead—they could still have followed the Americans in terms of process—but where the United Kingdom could have done something that politically was significant. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q49</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mark </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Hendrick</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I absolutely agree on that last point.

The terms within that referred specifically to produce of the settlements—how it had to be marked differently and so on—and there were penalties attached.

The </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> can play a particular role—whether in bilateral relations, applying similar types of distinctions between the produce of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> versus the produce of settlements, for instance—while also being much more proactive in the European context, not following the rest so much as taking more of a lead there.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Again, I am trying to emphasise relatively modest instruments that are already available and where the model is already there.

These are places where they do not anticipate that they will get pressure about the human rights of the Palestinians. So I think that the horse has bolted; this </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">is closing the stable doors.

The basic view in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, as you heard from the ambassador, is to sit tight and do nothing now, especially with the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Middle East</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> shifting and moving and so on.

The “ordinary Palestinians” I am in touch with are very disillusioned with their leadership and put no enthusiasm or faith in either faction. They are barely paying attention to the talks initiated by John Kerry because they do not see them producing anything of relevance that they should be interested or excited about. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sayigh</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I agree pretty much entirely with that. I will add that in order to reach a meaningful and durable peace deal between Palestinians and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, it is important that both </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Hamas and the Fatah/Palestinian Authority in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">West Bank</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> can both be brought on board. I will explain briefly why I say that. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">First, there is an opportunity. Hamas initially responded to the Arab Spring with a lot of enthusiasm and became over-optimistic. They thought that they and their general position of resistance had been vindicated and that the Arab Spring had brought a number of sympathetic Governments, in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Egypt</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and beyond, and that they had made it to the shore of safety, as it were. They now feel differently and they are under siege again politically as well as economically. They are starting to have to face up to the fact that their grand strategy and expectations are not very likely to succeed in the foreseeable future. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">At the same time, something important happened this year. When they had their internal elections, it was widely expected that Khalid </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Meshaal</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—who had been leading the way to position Hamas for negotiations on the basis of a two-state solution with 1967 borders and so on—was on his way out. In fact, he was returned along with a number of other people of his faction, at the expense of some of the more hawkish figures. That suggests that Hamas remains heavily pragmatic. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I have a concern about any kind of deal that John Kerry produces. On the one hand, as Professor Hollis just said, it is correct that most Palestinians just do not have much faith in their leaders and are too disillusioned to respond much. That does not mean that they have bought in; they might not do anything physical against it for a while. However, is that a peace upon which both Palestinians and Israel can actually build much further, without bringing Gaza—and therefore Hamas—back into the equation? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Sooner or later, we all have to bite that bullet and deal with it. I am making the point that I think Hamas is a party that needs to be brought in. Somehow, in some form, it has to be part of the political dialogue. There is no choice there in my view, if we really want some sort of long-term understanding. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q51</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mike Gapes:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> On the Israeli side, this is a right-wing, or right-of-centre, Government.

I thought he was moderating his position for a British audience. I am interested to know your assessment of whether an agreement would actually be possible with the current Israeli Government, or would the internal compromises be too much? Would they, in effect, have to bring the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Labor</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> party in, so that they get the agreement with another Government? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Bregman</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think that he will have to change the composition of his coalition, because part of the current coalition—at least one important party—is based on settlers, and they would be very reluctant to vote for any agreement that involves giving up land which they believe belongs to them. But it is only a right-wing Israeli Government that can deliver peace in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, ironically enough, because the left will always support the right’s peace plans, and on the other hand, the right will never support a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Labor</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Government offering the West Bank etc. So it is a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Lieberman</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> we need; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Netanyahu</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is a moderate now. We need a right-wing Prime Minister who would be able to carry Israeli people with him. The Israeli nation now—and this is not a criticism but an observation—is a right-wing nation. In 1990-91, thousands of Jews came from </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Russia</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, and most of them, not all of them, are right-wing voters now.

She, as she explained to me and others, absolutely could not make any mention of the Palestinian issue, in order to make her political career. That movement had to appeal to social justice for the middle classes who find the prices too high in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Tel Aviv</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. Only now is that element in the Knesset slowly and cautiously moving towards revealing how much the settlements cost Israeli taxpayers. But contacts such as hers and other alumni who are working for human rights organisations—some of which the Israelis have tried to crack down on and crack down on the foreign funding for—are reporting to me that Israeli schoolchildren and Israeli people in general since 1967 have not had maps in general circulation that show where the green line is. When it is pointed out to them what a settlement based on the green line would be, they become very nervous. This is not something that they think is doable without compromising their security. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The “narrow neck of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">” theory has been around in the international observer community for ages.

I think that since </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is a democracy it is critical for the Israeli public to rethink the incentive structure. In other words, as long as Israelis feel that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Israel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> can continue to build settlements and expand and so on—and this has pretty much been the feeling for the past 20 years of the peace process—there has not been a choice to make. Ronnie has referred to the one time we saw evidence. At the start of the 1990s when hundreds of thousands of Russian Jews came to Israel, there was a moment, if you remember, when President George Bush Senior stood up and made the provision of housing loans guarantees to Israel partly contingent on spending on settlements in the Occupied Territories. By contingent, I mean where an amount that the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> calculated was being spent by the Israeli Government on settlement activity would be deducted from the guarantees. It was a penalty. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That came at a moment when these hundreds of thousands of new immigrants needed housing and subsidies and a package, basically, and there was a cost. That created enough of a swing to bring Yitzhak Rabin to power in the next election in June 1992. Ever since then that sort of contingency, that sort of incentive structure has been lost. Israelis today feel that they have access to world markets; they want normalisation as per the Arab peace plan before providing peace—I mean an actual peace deal—and to build settlements. Every time John Kerry goes to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Jerusalem</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, yet another few hundred or few thousand housing units are announced, and there is no cost to pay. Why should an Israeli voter think that this is an issue about which to distinguish between one party and another? I mean, if an Israeli party comes along and says, “We stand on a ‘no more funding of settlements’ ticket”, people would laugh at them.

The Arab countries in the Middle East are at the start of a long process of social and political transition as a result of everything that has been happening in the past 40 years: massive urbanisation; social transformation; massive state expansion; liberalisation and privatisation, which affect societies on a massive scale; and massive population growth. We are living with something that is going to be with us for a very long time. I don’t see any of the external powers—I am thinking mainly of western ones, of course, although I am not assuming a moral, political or other obligation on their part—able to intervene in pretty much any of these places.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What are they to do about </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Egypt</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> now that the armed forces have in effect reasserted authoritarian rule, or whatever we want to call it?

I will remind you of just one instance. I am thinking of March 1998: the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Berlin</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> statement, when the EU Council issued a commitment to Palestinian statehood, because the expectation was that the final status negotiations would start the year after.

I wish I had something more positive to say, but I fear that not just the Arab Spring, but a whole range of things, have placed us today in a situation where there is no power around us—the British Government, the American Government or the whole coalition of Governments—that is able or willing to invest what it would take to make a real shift in the direction of events in Palestine or elsewhere. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q55</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Roy:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Lastly, can I ask you about the role of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Iran</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and the conciliatory moves from the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> towards it?

It is just terrifying that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Gaza</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> can be treated in that manner when it is home to 1.6 million people.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sayigh</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I do not really have much to add to that.

This is now the third </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">constitutional referendum that we have had in three years—not to mention other constitutional declarations and initiatives. This is a country that is reaching a point where there is no consensus on the overarching authority within which people conduct their business. The implications for all neighbours are going to be very big but, as Rosemary said, one cannot assume that it will necessarily go in one direction or another when it comes to the peace process.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Thank you all very much indeed.
