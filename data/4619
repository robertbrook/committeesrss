It is populated largely by international institutions. Many non-European financial services firms locate their European headquarters in London to access both the international market and the EU’s Single Market based on the knowledge that the same regulatory system exists across the entire of the EU and that they can access European markets freely from London. Moreover, many non-UK European banks locate in London to access the markets in which London has accrued specialities from financial and legal services to marine industry services. Many non-UK EU firms choose to list on the London Stock Exchange in order to access the capital on offer there, directly channelling capital to European businesses from London. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="4" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14pt; padding-left:22pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">It will come as little surprise therefore that there is strong evidence among City firms to remain in the EU</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> and research published by both TheCityUK and the CBI further supports that view</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">. In order to contribute to the ongoing national debate over the EU/UK relationship, the City of London Corporation has commissioned opinion research on the UK’s relationship with Europe. This has been carried out by Ipsos Mori and is made up of 100 interviews of senior business leaders as part of Ipsos Mori’s annual ‘Captains of Industry’ Survey. The sample is augmented with an additional 120 senior financial services professionals, providing a total sample size of 220. These interviews include ‘open questions’ that will provide an opportunity for business leaders to explain what reforms they would like to see made in Europe to improve business competitiveness. The results will be available early next year.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="5" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14pt; padding-left:22pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">It may also be worthwhile bringing to your attention that t</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">he Lord Mayor</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> Fiona Woolf</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> and the City’s Policy Chairman</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> Mark Boleat</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> have </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">recently</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> returned from a visit to Athens ahead of Greece assuming the EU presidency in January.
