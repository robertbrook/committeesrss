This should mean investing more in care closer to where people live and in some cases it may be necessary to reduce the scope of services within hospitals. Similarly, if clinical evidence and patient experience highlight the need to concentrate certain services in specialist centres on fewer sites, as has been the case in relation to stroke service in London, then resources will need to be shifted. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">4.5 The changes in North West London's NHS, recently announced by the Secretary of State, show how the NHS can secure the support of the local community for service change by clearly explaining the benefits before any decisions are made.

They must demonstrate how patients can benefit from being treated in a more convenient location and how this will take the pressure off other services.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">5.

Good progress has been made so far in delivering the required savings and there is always more to be done to improve productivity and value for money. However, as we warned when we submitted evidence to the Committee last year, most NHS organisations are now approaching the end of their capacity to make "easy" savings, the so called "low hanging fruit".

We must avoid another disruptive, structural reorganisation of the health service and we strongly recommend a cross-party agreement on this issue ahead of the next general election.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">6.2 One possible way that politicians could establish a more permissive environment for strategic planning and investment in the NHS would be to consider the scope for longer term health spending settlements. At present, the NHS appears to be focusing on making ends meet each year without necessarily knowing what is around the corner. This makes it harder for NHS organisations to work with local partners to front load investment on the basis of plans that might realise savings and value dynamically.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">6.3 Longer spending settlements, for example a ten year settlement, that are based on demographic and economic projections, produced by the Office for National Statistics and the Office for Budgetary Responsibility respectively, would provide a clearer indication of the funds available to the NHS in the future and would require governments to give good reasons for deviating dramatically from these projections. It could also provide the clear signal for establishing multiple year CCG allocations, extended tariff prices and longer local contracting. In addition, clarity is needed on allocations at a regional and local level within the overall NHS budget. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">6.4 The NHS will need to be imaginative and make best use of the money available, if spending is unlikely to increase over the coming years, not least recognising the need to invest in redesigning services. This means accessing all the funding available and taking a more joined up approach to risk pooling and budget underspends. We need to make sure that we manage risk in a way that ensures funds are available if the worse should happen. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">However, at present the NHS can be risk averse and risk pools are being dealt with separately. Greater transparency is still needed on how existing and future funds within the NHS can be reinvested to improve care. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">6.5 For example, NHS England needs to set out what in the long view its plans are for the top-slicing of CCG budgets. The Department of Health (DH) also needs to be clear about the reasons behind the repeated gap between total health spending and the Departmental Expenditure Limit and if this money can be reinvested. The consistent underspends of public money on the NHS suggest the DH needs to be less risk averse in how it is using this funding. At a local level, commissioners will need to be clear how they plan on spending the 30 per cent marginal rate for emergency admissions. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">7. Redesigning incentives</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">7.1 More also needs to be done to ensure that the right incentives are in place across the system. We need to incentivise better joint working, more focus on prevention and greater investment in community services. The current NHS payment system includes an array of different arrangements but is dominated by an activity-based mechanism that funds most services in hospitals. This system has developed in an ad hoc way to address various issues and plug particular gaps across the system.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">7.2 While this is understandable, we believe there is now a real opportunity to take a more strategic approach towards incentives in the NHS as a whole. Monitor and NHS England take joint responsibility for the NHS payment system from next year and they will need to avoid being prescriptive and allow local leaders the freedom to develop local incentives. National bodies will need to support and enable these local freedoms by providing best practice case examples and expertise. We have been encouraged so far by the progress made by NHS England and Monitor on this and their engagement with the sector, but it should be recognised that this work is still at an early stage.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">7.3 Two thirds of NHS leaders in our survey this year highlighted funding mechanisms as the main barrier to delivering a more integrated and community-based model of care. That being said, it is also important to recognise that payment mechanisms alone will not be enough to make the progress needed. Providers and commissioners will need to have frank conversations about how they can best support each other to make changes local people want and need.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">8. Pay in the NHS</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">8.1 Employers in the NHS tell us that they want to support NHS staff and improve morale and they recognise the important role pay plays in that. However, with the NHS under growing financial pressure, their focus is on improving patient care. Restraining the pay bill is essential to ensure this, as well as in minimising job losses. There is no denying the hard work of NHS staff but a one per cent increase in doctors pay, for example, would cost the NHS more than £100 million, the equivalent of over 2,000 registrars working in hospital. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Despite a headline pay freeze in the last two years, most NHS staff have been receiving incremental pay increases of around three per cent as they climb up through their pay bands.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">8.2 This is a crucial time for negotiations on pay in the NHS. Nurses, support staff, cleaners and other healthcare professionals have already agreed on changes to sick pay and linking pay progression to performance. The BMA has agreed to negotiations with NHS Employers on consultant and junior doctors contracts. This represents a real opportunity to move forward on some important issues, not least facilitating more seven day working in the NHS, and is an opportunity for doctors to show leadership on this. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">8.3 In the long term, we need to engage with our staff and unions to explore how we can come out of a period of pay restraint in a sustainable way, recognising the significant contribution of staff to delivering high quality patient care and generating solutions to the financial and demand challenge that we face. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">8.4 It is important to note the potential impact of draft proposals for changes to the NHS occupational pension scheme which are likely to increase employer contributions from 2015. This is in addition to changes to national insurance which will come into effect in 2016. Employers have considerable anxieties about how additional national insurance contributions will be met and the impact on the NHS pay bill.  Consideration needs to be given to the wider implications of these proposals on employers' costs and the impact that would have on patients. It would be perverse if additional costs of National Insurance led to staff opting out of the occupational pension scheme making it unsustainable. These tensions will need to be resolved in the next spending review.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">9. Long term financial viability of NHS Foundation Trusts  (FT) and NHS Trusts</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">9.1 We are deeply concerned about the growing number of NHS trusts that are in deficit and those approaching financial failure. It is becoming clear there is scant chance of a large number of NHS trusts being awarded FT status. Published accounts show that last year, without additional support, the NHS trust sector reported an overall deficit of £104 million.</span><a name="_ftnref7"></a><a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> In fact, just under a quarter of NHS trusts (23) would not have broken even if not for additional funding. Over the last two years, just seven trusts have been authorised while almost double that amount have had their application withdrawn, postponed, rejected or deferred.</span><a name="_ftnref8"></a><a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> Of the 98 NHS trusts that still exist, only around 30 per cent are either with Monitor for assessment or are being reviewed for referral by the NHS Trust Development Authority (NTDA). The deadline for all NHS trusts to become FTs has now been abandoned, but no clear strategy seems to have been put in its place to address these concerns.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">9.2 Furthermore, there are also alarming indicators about a number of FTs. The Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) margin, which gives a good indication of the operational profitability of an organisation, across the FT sector is 5.13 per cent.</span><a name="_ftnref9"></a><a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> This has fallen from 5.7 per cent two years ago. Alarmingly, Monitor has a </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">threshold of 5 per cent, below which it would not normally authorise an FT. The average across the acute sector is 4.72 per cent, which highlights that a number of acute trusts are struggling. The EBITDA for small acute hospitals in particular is currently 3.30 per cent and 16 of the 18 trusts subject to enforcement action are small or medium in size (below £400m turnover). Similar concerns are found in the trends in average financial and governance risk ratings, which show a continual escalation in the risks associated with FTs.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">9.3 We are clear that the NTDA and Monitor need to play a more active role in supporting financially troubled trusts and to enable them to become sustainable or to make difficult change if this is not possible. National bodies will need to facilitate collaboration and joint working across the whole of a local health system - we are clear that problems cannot be solved by treating individual providers in isolation from their neighbours, and service redesign would almost always need to happen over a bigger footprint than just one trust. Commissioners too have a key system leadership role to play in tackling these issues. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">9.4 We are therefore calling on the Department of Health to set out a clear strategy on how this issue should be tackled. This will need to include clarity on the roles and responsibilities of national bodies and a clear indication of the resources available to those bodies to perform their roles. In the long term, all political parties will need to set out how they intend on tackling the issue of financially challenged and failing NHS providers. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">9.5 We have to be clearer though about the relationship between finance and quality. The NHS needs to deliver both better care and find efficiency savings year-on-year. Sometimes, these two challenges can seem independent, but in practice finance and quality in healthcare are inextricably linked. Better care can be cheaper and efficient services are often more effective, but the reverse can also be true. Proposals for a single failure regime announced in the Government's response to the Francis report highlight that this is now recognised by the national bodies. However, it will require more than just these proposals. National bodies will need to show in their actions that they understand the impact that financial decisions have on quality, and vice versa, and ensure that their regulatory approaches are complementary and reciprocal.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">9.6 Responding to failure, whether it is triggered by finances or quality, can mean a crisis driven change of services. The events regarding the South London NHS Healthcare NHS Trust demonstrate why this sort of change is not desirable and action must be taken to prevent it from happening in the first place. However, where crisis driven change is required a clear failure regime which allows for proper engagement with the local community is essential.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> We therefore welcome recent amendments to the Unsustainable Provider Regime in the Care Bill which would help address some of the concerns we raised with the Government about lack of clarity.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">10.

We remain concerned about the progress in integrating care. Our 2013 annual </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">member survey revealed that 59 per cent of our members think slight progress is being made towards a more integrated and community-based model of care and only 8 per cent believe this progress to be significant.  </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">10.2 Respondents to our survey were asked about the consequences they thought might arise if not enough progress towards integration is made. 61 per cent think the main consequence would be an unsustainable service. These results highlight the need to overcome silos and practical hurdles towards integration at both a national and local level. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">10.3 In addition a recent joint NHS Confederation and ADASS survey found that the biggest positive contributor was strong leadership and commitment 'from the top'. More than 80 per cent of respondents said these were the most important factors at play in taking forward integration locally. The most frequently cited factor holding up integration efforts was data and IT systems. 64 per cent of survey respondents said data and IT systems are an impediment to developing integrated services</span><a name="_ftnref10"></a><a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">10.4 A range of models have been developed by local leaders to fit local needs but more needs to be done to ensure there is widespread adoption of these models. We have highlighted to the Committee recommendations for ensuring this is the case, including in our joint submission with ADASS and the LGA for the last public expenditure inquiry which we attach to this submission.

We have been very clear on the impact that underinvestment in social care and other out-of-hospital services has had on the NHS as a whole.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">11.2 Under the new arrangements funds will potentially be spent on health services, as well as social care once they are locally agreed. There will be stronger conditions in place in terms of how the money is used, and local joint plans will have to detail how the money is spent. However, it is vital that there is collaboration and agreement across health and social care on how best to use the money to get the best possible outcomes for the local population and the NHS must be closely involved in decisions on how these plans are developed.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">11.3 We have some questions about the feasibility of CCGs and local authorities being asked to create plans over a very short period of time - they are currently expected to develop and agree plans for both 2014/15 and 2015/16, by February 2014. Furthermore, the development of health and wellbeing boards varies greatly across the country and we would question how well equipped many boards are to play a key role in the fund and provide scrutiny of local plans, as is the current expectation.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">11.4 Clarity is also needed on how these plans will be funded. When deciding how the ITF will operate in practice, it is crucially important that we take into account the impact on particular parts of the NHS, given the current financial pressures. While we welcome any measures that ensure there is greater investment in community services, the Government will need to make certain they closely monitor the impact on the acute sector, given the number of trusts who are in danger of financial failure and to avoid any potential destabilisation caused by changes to the tariff being used to fund the ITF. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">12.
