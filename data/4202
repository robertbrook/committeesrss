The decline was due to the belief that it the world would produce ever more plentiful and ever cheaper amounts of food elsewhere that the UK could import and so it was not necessary to produce food in the UK.  That mistaken theory is responsible for today’s crisis in UK farming.</span></li><li style="font-family:Calibri;

The quality of the crop was better this year but the overall harvest of wheat was less than 2012.</span></li><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">No insurance scheme will ever be affordable and consumers, already hard pressed by rising costs of living, will not cope with food prices that are evermore unpredictable.   Such volatility would also have adverse effects on the UK economy. Nor can farmers be expected to keep on farming let alone plan any investment when they do not know whether financial ruin will ensue from doing so thanks to the unpredictable weather.  There needs to be some scheme that enables farmers affected by such weather events to receive emergency payments that ensures their lives and businesses are maintained at a reasonable level.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Markets and Production</span></p><ol type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">While there is always much said about access to markets and increasing production, especially for small producers, they are not the issues that are relevant.  Markets are finite and the world food market is already over-subscribed.  Every international aid agency says that there is more than enough food in the world to feed everybody and if the total of food that is wasted were not, the planet could still feed a few billion more people with present supplies.  The problem is that many do not have access to land on which to grow food or money with which to buy it.  That is why we have a billion people obese while a similar number starve.  The theory that the WTO subscribes to is that market forces will ensure that food production gravitates to those parts of the planet where it will be produced most cheaply and efficiently and everyone will benefit.  Unfortunately the word “efficiently” is all too often an euphemism for “where the natural resources and population are most easily exploited”.  That is why smallholder farmers around the world are fighting to stay on their land instead of being driven off to starve in countries which have no alternative employment or welfare payments.  This situation will not be resolved until food is regarded as a basic human right and not merely a commodity to be traded.</span></li><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">There is access to markets in the UK through farmers markets, farm shops and the internet.  Also some of the big supermarkets are stocking more local produce.  People are getting more concerned about how their food is produced and do not want potatoes from the south of the country passing lorry loads of potatoes from the north of the country on our motorways.  The move towards the discount supermarkets also shows they are not bothered about having the “choice” of several brands of the same product.  They want locally produced food and also variety within localities.  If they go to the Lake District for a holiday they want the locally produced food there to taste different from that in Cornwall or at their home farmers market.</span></li><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Food is heavy and bulky and requires a great deal of the earth’s natural resources to move it about, metal ores etc as well as fuel.  We need to consider just what we need to move and why both internationally and within our own borders.  The UK will not produce tea and bananas, but has a surplus of lamb so why bring lamb from New Zealand when UK lamb is in season.  Speciality and artisan foods will find export markets, but that does not benefit the farmer who produced the basic commodities.  While the UK exports feed wheat. It has to import bread wheat as we are not self-sufficient in it.  Even in those years when the quality is good, it may  not benefit  the farmers as if other areas of the world have a good crop of bread wheat also and that can be imported into the UK more cheaply, that is what happens and wheat prices here crash.  The consumer does not benefit as the amount of wheat in a </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">loaf of bread is worth only pennies and the price does not go down if the price of wheat falls,.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Increasing self sufficiency</span></p><ol type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Increasing self-sufficiency is rather more complicated than increasing production of certain crops etc.  The problems of supply and demand have always plagued farming and have never been properly addressed in recent decades.  Even before our climate started changing in recent years it was impossible to match supply and demand due to the vagaries of weather and other factors.  For essential foodstuffs it would be prudent to plan to grow 105% or expected demand but producing as little as 101% could be enough in some cases to push prices down below the costs of production, especially for a foodstuff that does not store.  Even for something that can be exported, such as wheat, the promise of a good harvest is usually greeted by the grain merchants with dire predictions of how difficult it will be to export and how low the prices will be – and this is In spite or farmers always being told we must produce ever more food to meet the world’s expected population growth.</span></li><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">If self-sufficiency is to be increased the population will need to learn about the seasons foodstuffs are produced in this country rather than expecting them to be imported all year round.  Then they will know when they can buy fresh British produce and choose whether or not they want imports at other times.  Also the practice of importing produce that will be in direct competition with the British equivalent needs to cease, especially for fresh fruit and vegetables.  Why are strawberries imported into the UK at the height of the British strawberry season?  All it does is force down the prices British growers receive for their crop in the name of consumer “choice”.   No-one benefits except the supermarkets.  Also supermarkets should stock British food when it is in season and ensure it is properly and clearly labelled as such.</span></li><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Since the last war the focus has been on increasing production, though that has come at the cost of depleting soil nutrients, damaging soil structure, shortening the lives of dairy cows and so on.  Machinery size has increased so that they badly rut fields that are not perfectly dry and sink up to their axles in muddy ones.  They are also so complicated that repair bills can run into thousands of pounds for replacing electronic parts, while fuel bills have also risen dramatically. The reduction In the farming workforce means that farmers have become increasingly isolated and at the top of the lists for suicide, cancer, stress etc.  A fresh way of thinking is now necessary for food security, with plant breeders concentrating on crop varieties that are capable of delivering a reasonable crop in a wide variety of weather conditions rather than good yield and quality only when the growing conditions are perfect.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">December 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
