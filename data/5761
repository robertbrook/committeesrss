font-size:11pt">The original business requirement was for DMI Production Tools to provide a rough cut editor.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> This is a facility that allows programme makers to take video content, chop it around and join it together into a rough version of the final program.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> The DMI team developed this functionality which took a number of months of development and testing to complete.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> Subsequently, despite having what they had asked for, the BBC Production teams required that DMI replace this functionality with a third party tool from Adobe called Cottonwood which provided similar but enhanced functionality.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> This necessitated removing the rough cutter from DMI and integrating Adobe’s product with DMI, again a significant amount of work.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> Then several months after this was done, the BBC Production teams stated that they wanted Adobe Premier Pro CS6 instead of Adobe Cottonwood.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> The project pushed back and so then the BBC Production teams stated that they wanted a “File Assembly Tool” which was a form of Rough Cutter but different to the original requirements.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> The project had to invest significant further unplanned work into the File Assembly Tool which was delivered soon after BBC Vision and North decided that they no longer wanted DMI Production Tools.</span></li></ol></ol><p style="font-size:11pt;

font-size:11pt">The original requirement for the Metadata Archive, which allows BBC staff to search for and find archive content, was to have a “free format” search facility along the lines of a Google Search.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> The DMI project designed this solution and agreed it with the business before delivering the technology.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> This was an extremely difficult and challenging feature to deliver but it was delivered.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> Once delivered the business then said that it was not what the needed because it did not allow “structured searches”.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> What this means is that with the search as defined </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">at the outset </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">and delivered </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">by the project </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">a query for say the word “snow” would find all content that had the word “snow” in the metadata.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> So programmes featuring snow in the title, description or comments would be found along with programmes that had a presenter, actor, producer, director…. with the name Snow.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> Then t</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">he business asked for the ability to search by individual attributes in the metadata e.g. “Presenter = Snow”.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> So the DMI project built this functionality as an alternative to the free format search.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> Again, this was a significant and challenging piece of work.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> Then the business realised that the data in their existing system, Infax, was not well organised as over time people had put information into comment fields, descriptions etc. so the business then asked that the search functionality be modified yet further to allow both free format and structured search to work together.</span></li></ol></ol><p style="font-size:11pt;
