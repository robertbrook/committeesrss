Another patient note says “these experiences challenge her hold on reality” and another says of the patient “spoke about her efforts to understand the disturbing feeling of dissociation that leaves her unsure as to what is true and what isn't”. It is typical of people who have Borderline Personality Disorder/Dissociative Identity Disorder as the patient has that they may not know what is true and what is not and that is why the Dissociative Experiences Scale used to decide if patient's have Dissociative Identity Disorder asks the patient if they ever think something has happened that has not really happened at all because they can get it into their head that something has happened that has not happened and the patient's notes prove that on 2 occasions she told hospital staff both that she feared she may have made up all her allegations of abuse and that she had so much going on in her head she couldn't be sure that what she thought had happened really had happened and so admitted she was not sure if her allegations a doctor had touched her were true.

Dr. Richard Hall in his paper entitled “Patients Who Make False Allegations” says that “angry borderline patients” are known to be much more likely to make false allegations that their Psychiatrist has abused them. He gives an instance of a patient with Borderline Personality Disorder who falsely accused her Psychiatrist of abusing her simply because she was angry at him for not giving her the time and attention she wanted. The patient has a high scoring for Borderline Personality Disorder and she may have been angry at me for saying that I thought it was preferable she be seen by a female therapist rather than by me to discuss all her allegations of abuse about the 6 other men she alleges have abused her. Dr. Hall says the higher the number of allegations the more suspicious one should be about whether they are true. Including me the patient has accused 7 men of abusing her but none of her allegations about the other 6 have ever been proved to be true and indeed the Police refused to prosecute a man she accused of abusing and raping her because, according to the patient's GMC Statement, they said there was insufficient evidence she was telling the truth and that she was very (psychiatrically) ill at the time. Despite this the GMC/MPTS in their racism decided that her allegations about me are true and have ignored vital patient notes that prove I did not even work at the hospital at some of the times the patient said a doctor had touched her and ignored the notes that prove the patient herself doubts her allegations and fears she may have made them all up. The patient's notes show the patient was having difficulty in distinguishing her female Psychotherapist from her own mother whom she hates and so show that the patient may have had difficulty in distinguishing me from her own father whom she alleges abused her in childhood although the notes show that her mother and friend do not believe he abused her and that her mother does not believe a man whom the patient accused of abusing and raping her, who was a friend of her mother, actually did abuse and rape her.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">A patient note says no-one is willing to give a Witness Statement to the Police supporting the patient's allegations of abuse and gives the reason for this as being “because of her illness”.
