The issue of level crossing safety initiated Network Rail to set up Road Rail Partnership Groups (RRPGs) across the country in an effort to facilitate joined up thinking particularly around problem locations. The success of these has wavered alt</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">hough network rail would state that they are in </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">operation across the majority of the country. Although the intention has recently been to widen the remit of these groups to include bridge strikes and road vehicle incursions, this has not been widely realis</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">ed. The principle reason for this in the author’s opinion is that the three topic areas are championed by different departments within Network Rail. As a highway authority, it has to be said that there is little visible evidence of cross working inside Net</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">work Rail.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">One </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">safety related </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">example concerns the policy of highway authorities ‘gritting’ over level crossings. Documented highway maintenance practice was based upon previous advice from network rail in that the salt distributed caused signal and track </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">circuit failures. Over time some highway authorities have spread salt over level crossing surfaces on the basis that the risk to road users of not doing so is greater and, in the event of a collision where a road vehicle has skidded, could render the highw</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">ay authority liable on the basis it had failed its duty of care under The Highway Act. Research sponsored jointly through the Rail Safety Standards Board (RSSB) failed to show any evidence that ‘gritting’ over level crossings was detrimental to signalling </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">and track circuits</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt"> and showed no failures or premature maintenance caused by corrosion of the rails. Thus, in the interests of interface safety Network Rail (Operations) agreed with highway authorities that ‘gritting’ should be carried out across level cro</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">ssings. Network Rail (Signalling) was not satisfied by the research and vetoed the agreement. Two years on, highway authorities are still awaiting the conclusion of this internal debate.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 45.51pt; padding-left:11.19pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Problems in designing safe road layouts near or at level crossings</span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 17.45pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">It would be jointly agreed by both highway and rail authoritie</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">s that the best solution would be to have no level crossings (ie. road rail interface) at all.
