font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The reforms to legal aid introduced on 1 April 2013, in particular the abolition of the capital passport where a person receives certain State benefits, already cause such practical difficulty in funding of legal services.  For example legal aid will be refused if assessed disposable capital exceeds £8,000.  There are already cases where the incapacitated person is ineligible for legal aid because their sole asset is their home and the equity exceeds the capital disregard, but the reality is that the equity is practically unavailable and their income is unable to fund legal services.  It is unclear how the Government expects such a person to utilise their capital to fund litigation or otherwise to take steps to secure alternate funding for legal representation.  I would also point out that there may be no person with lawful authority to manage that incapacitated person’s financial affairs, that such persons are often at risk of, or have in fact suffered, financial abuse, and because of their impaired mental capacity will be particularly vulnerable in the context of alternate funding arrangements.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt;

font-size:11pt">The residence test imposes a further barrier.  The Government does not accept that the residence test proposal will disproportionately affect those who lead chaotic lives because it states that solicitors are well practiced in adducing the necessary information from the most vulnerable clients (</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Transforming Legal Aid: Next Steps, </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Annex F: Equality Statement).  A person with impaired mental capacity is clearly a vulnerable client but the reality is that person may not be able to assist in providing the solicitor with the required information and documents or even with sufficient information to enable the solicitor to investigate further (if willing to do so) whether the residence test is met.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt;

they may choose to represent themselves in court, seek to resolve issues by themselves, pay for services which support self-resolution, or decide not to tackle the issue at all.   An incapacitated party is not able to represent themselves in court, is highly unlikely to be able to take steps to resolve the issues, or to undertake self-resolution. It is also unlikely that they will make a positive decision not to tackle the issue at all because of their impaired mental capacity and may not in fact either understand that there is an issue which requires resolution, or a legal right which should be enforced.  It may also not be open to the incapacity party to avoid proceedings as they may have to respond to proceedings brought by others and the decision is not therefore in their hands.  </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">12.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">I would point out that no alternative dispute resolution method was identified in the Ministry of Justice’s </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Transforming legal aid: delivering a more credible and efficient system</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> (CP14/2013) or its predecessor consultation</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic"> Proposals for the Reform of Legal Aid in England and Wales </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">(CP12/10) which would provide a fair process for a person lacking mental capacity, either to conduct litigation or to conduct their own property and affairs, for resolving the issues (having regard to the functional elements of capacitated decision making identified in section 3(1) Mental Capacity Act 2005) and arriving at a legally effective decision.  The Government’s response to the responses to consultation </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Transforming Legal Aid: Next Steps</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> does not assist.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">13.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Nor do I consider that the fact that any person excluded from civil legal aid as a result of the residence test is </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; text-decoration:underline">entitled to apply for</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> (but not to receive) exceptional funding under the power set out in section 10 of LASPO to be a safeguard sufficient to meet the concern about the position of those with impaired mental capacity.  The decision to grant exceptional funding is discretionary (regardless of whether the application would otherwise meet the means and merits test).  The Lord Chancellor’s Exceptional Funding Guidance makes clear that section 10(3)(b) LASPO does not provide a general power to fund cases that fall outside scope of legal aid and says in terms that the power is to be used for rare cases.   Although solicitors can assist a person to make an application for exceptional funding, legal aid for making the application is only be available retrospectively if the application is granted.  </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">14.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The reality is that the most vulnerable will be left in a position where they do not have effective access to justice.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">27 September 2013</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><div style="width:auto; height:auto; float:right;"><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">1</span></p></div><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 18pt 10pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
