Thanks very much for coming to give evidence today. This has the potential to be a very difficult evidence session, but let us try to make it as easy as possible, from the point of view of witnesses and of the Committee. We appreciate that there are some questions which we will put to you which you won’t be able to answer in public for reasons of security. But when you answer, I would ask you to indicate as clearly as you can, please, where there are questions or parts of questions which you can’t answer in public and we will pursue those matters further in private. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">For the benefit of those who are listening to this, you need to know that there will be a transcript of the private session, but only a redacted version of that transcript will be published. Agreeing the redactions may take some time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">We would all like to keep as much of this evidence session in public as we can, consistent with the security of ISAF forces. Gentlemen, would you please bear that in mind in answering our questions. When you answer, please answer as much in public as you are able. We share the overriding concern that you no doubt feel that nothing that is said in public should jeopardise the security of ISAF forces. Please remember, however, that we as the Defence Committee of the House of Commons have the duty, on behalf of the British people, to scrutinise what happens within the Ministry of Defence and in our armed forces and, as much as possible, to do so in public.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Having said that, we know, General </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Capewell</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">, that you would like to start with an opening statement.

First, I am very grateful for the opportunity to brief your Committee on this important issue. As the Chief of Joint Operations, I am responsible for the deployment, sustainment and recovery of UK armed forces personnel in Afghanistan. However—and this is an important point—I am not directly responsible for the day-to-day operational and tactical direction in-theatre. This is rightly managed on the ground by ISAF commanders, which is why we hand control of UK forces to ISAF in Afghanistan. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">I have been involved with the Afghan campaign in this and other roles for some 12 years. This experience gives me a particular perspective on the events of 14 and 15 September. The attack on Camp Bastion of September 2012 resulted in two US deaths and led to a significant US materiel loss. As such, it demonstrated that a defensive weakness existed in the camp; a weakness that a determined insurgency found and </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">exploited. It is entirely right, therefore, that the attack has been the focus of such extensive scrutiny from ISAF, from the US and from ourselves, and that so much effort has been exerted to ensure, as far as possible, that the same thing cannot happen again.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Before I begin, Mr Chairman, with your permission, I want to honour the two US Marines who lost their lives and the 17 others who were wounded that night. I offer my sincere condolences to the families of Lieutenant-Colonel </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Raible</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> and Sergeant Atwell for their loss. I also pay tribute to those US and UK personnel who responded so gallantly to this bold and well-planned attack.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">To aid your understanding of how things looked in September 2012, there were 37 UK bases in Helmand province, compared to the five, including Bastion, now. At this point in the campaign, ISAF forces retained lead responsibility for security in Helmand province and were very much engaged in direct combat operations against the insurgents, alongside their Afghan National Security Force partners. It was very clear to the UK commanders on the ground that the focus of the fight was within Taskforce Helmand’s area of operations and not in the area immediately surrounding Camp Bastion. Indeed, up to 14 September the Camp Bastion-Leatherneck-</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Shorabak</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> complex had never been subject to ground attack.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">In the days leading up to the attack there were no intelligence reports indicating an imminent threat to the complex. That said, to give context, well before the attack we had implemented a number of force protection enhancements. These included additional patrol manpower, an automated sense and warn capability, enhanced protected mobility, increased flight line security, additional troops to man guard towers and an RAF Force Protection Wing headquarters.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">My objective today is to explain in the clearest terms what happened during the attack and to set out all that has been done since to identify lessons and act on them. In this public part of the briefing I will talk in outline about the attack itself. I will also explain the efforts expended by the coalition to learn lessons from the attack and to make appropriate adjustments to the defence of the Bastion/Leatherneck/</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Shorabak</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> complex. Given the obvious sensitivities about describing in public the details of how we protect our troops, I am grateful for your agreement to a closed session after this. I will use that private part of the briefing to expand on the events of 14 September and how coalition forces responded. I will also be able to talk more freely about the force protection arrangements that existed at the time of the attack and the specific measures we have taken to enhance these arrangements.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">So, to context. I now want to address some of the issues that have been raised publicly in relation to the attack. In September 2012 the perimeter line was a chain-link fence with ditch and </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">berm</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> obstacles and concertina wire. Then, as now, a number of guard towers were sited at intervals around the inside of the fence line. However, not all of the towers were manned at any one time. This reflected the assessed nature of the threat, which reporting suggested was predominantly focused on the vehicle entry points to the complex. Within the perimeter, the airfield was protected by a double-width concertina wire barrier and a ditch abutting the road which runs parallel to the flight line. The area outside the perimeter fence was subject to routine patrols by ISAF troops, with support from Afghan National Security Force partners.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">At this point I shall respond to some of the allegations in the press of penny-pinching with regards to force protection. Commanders in theatre have delegated authority to approve expenditure. At the time they could approve individual proposals of up to £500,000 in value. This was sufficient to cover anticipated force protection measures. Following the March 2012 incident, sometimes known as the “burning man” incident, in which an Afghan employee gained access and drove a car on to the runway, a business case was made focusing on preventing access to the runway from inside the camp. The recommended option which came to my headquarters and which was approved prior to the September attack involved enhancing the protection to the airfield through the construction of an additional ditch and </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">berm</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> to prevent vehicle access. I should emphasise that this option was decided in theatre with the support of my headquarters, following the examination of a number of alternative options, including the erection of a fence to protect the flight line. The details of the attack have been briefed and outlined to Parliament by the Secretary of State for Defence and are also well documented in the US accountability review. I will go into further detail in the private session.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">I would like to focus the majority of the rest of my opening remarks on the aftermath of the attack. As I said in my introduction, I am keen to help your Committee understand the considerable effort that has been expended by ISAF, the UK and the US to understand what happened during the attack, to identify appropriate lessons and to act on them. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, the commanders of the British Force Protection Unit completed what we in the UK refer to as an operational learning account and after action review, commonly known as an OLAAAR. In terms of ISAF activity, immediately following the attack the American commander of Regional Command (South West) instigated a joint review board. What had been captured in the UK OLAAAR was then subsumed into the Regional Command (South West) joint review board and not subject to any further formal staffing by the UK chain of command.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">After the OLAAAR was produced, I decided very quickly that the UK staff effort should be directed to supporting, rather than duplicating, the ISAF review process. I therefore sent members of my own staff to Camp Bastion to form part of the Regional Command (South West) review team. That review was completed on 24 September 2012. Concurrently, Commander ISAF directed his deputy commander, who is also the UK national contingent commander in theatre, to conduct an administrative review. This was competed on 27 September 2012. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">The deputy commander’s report concurred with each of the recommendations of the joint review board report, and recommended that HQ ISAF conduct regular reviews of progress on their implementation. The recommendations focused on force protection, command and control, manning, communications and internal personnel procedures. The Regional Command (South West) joint review board was followed by an ISAF supplemental review in December 2012. This additional activity was to ensure that the review took account of an earlier US anti-terrorism and force protection review of the complex. Regional Command (South West) also conducted specific Camp Bastion force protection reviews in October 2012 and February 2013. The ISAF staffing process concluded in March 2013. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">On the formal conclusion of the ISAF process, Commander ISAF wrote to his British deputy commander requesting that the UK review the reports with a view to taking appropriate action. This request was subsequently referred to me, with the formal documentation, by the deputy commander at the end of March 2013. Subsequently, I directed that a review be conducted within my headquarters to identify any further lessons to be learned from the existing report which had not already been taken into account—that is an important remark—and any other areas where further investigation was required.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">The review team consisted of subject matter experts who, as well as reviewing lessons, looked into what actions had been and were being undertaken to address any identified shortfalls. The review team reported its findings to me on 11 June. It concluded that there was no single causal factor for the attack and that no further lessons could be gleaned from the existing reviews and their supporting reports. It found no grounds, on the information presented in the reports, for any further investigations to be conducted. Following the review by my staff, the Adjutant-General was asked by CDS—the Chief of the Defence Staff—to conduct a review of all documents arising from the attack on Camp Bastion, independent of the operational chain of command. This was with a view to identifying any further lessons to be learned from existing reports which had not already been taken into account, and to make recommendations on any other areas where further investigation might be required. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">The Adjutant-General’s report was issued on 12 July 2013. The additional lesson he identified was that we must not allow national service sensitivities to override the requirement for clear lines of authority, accountability and responsibility in the coalition. He made no recommendations for further investigation. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">As far as the US process is concerned, the US launched what they referred to as their 15-6 investigation, broadly concurrent with my own review, on 21 May 2013. The redacted copy of their subsequent report was made available on the US Central Command website on 1 October 2013. Those dates are important in the light of the suggestions that our consideration of the US report was hasty. Our detailed examination of the report’s findings began in September on the basis of information we were receiving from our liaison staff in the US Central Command, and was conducted in the light of the considerable efforts that had already been expended in increasing our understanding of what happened and why. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">We received the classified version of the US report on 11 October 2013. That was immediately checked in my headquarters for any new material. I subsequently provided advice to the Chief of Defence Staff on 15 October 2013, making it clear that it shed no new light on events in terms of lessons identified, and there was no culpable failure on the part of UK forces at Camp Bastion.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Since the attack in September 2012, there have been significant enhancements to force protection at the complex in terms of manpower, obstacles, defences and military capabilities. Operational security considerations prevent a comprehensive list being described in this forum, but they include the deployment of additional personnel, improved command and control arrangements and enhanced base surveillance measures. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">I will finish with some reflections. Mr Chairman, I would like to end this public statement with a few personal remarks. The principal focus of coalition forces in Helmand province at that time was rightly on the vital ground in central and northern Helmand. There had never been a direct ground attack on the Bastion-Leatherneck-</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Shorabak</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> complex until that point. There was no specific intelligence reporting to indicate that such an attack was imminent or even likely. No requests from theatre for additional resources for force protection enhancements had been turned down in the UK in the months prior to the attack. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">The attack was significant in scale and ambition. It was carefully planned and well executed by a group of determined and heavily armed insurgents on a moonless night. It is clear that they were prepared to die in the attack, regardless of any physical obstacles they may have faced. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Operations in Afghanistan are complex, dynamic and dangerous. The enemy has a vote. In such circumstances mistakes cannot be ruled out. That is why we have such a comprehensive process to learn the lessons from an incident and take actions to resolve them as quickly as possible. I have every confidence that sufficient attention and rigour have been applied through the full range of ISAF and national investigations and reviews to ensure that all appropriate lessons from the attack have been identified and acted upon. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Shortcomings in command and control arrangements at the complex have been addressed and additional force protection measures have been implemented. However, we are not complacent. Routine reviews of force protection arrangements at the complex continue, as you would expect. Following the publication of the US review, I advised the Defence Secretary and the Chief of the Defence Staff that there was no reason to alter our assessment; that no further UK action was required in respect of events on 14 and 15 September 2012. That advice has been accepted. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">In closing my remarks, I would once again like to pay public tribute to the US personnel who lost their lives and to all who responded to the attack. Their courageous actions undoubtedly prevented greater loss of life and equipment. Thank you. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q2</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> General, thank you. I think the Committee would very much wish to echo those closing remarks. We would also wish to pay tribute to all of the ISAF forces, who do such an incredibly dangerous and difficult job in Afghanistan, some of them paying a very heavy price indeed for what they do. So thank you for that. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">During the course of this evidence session we will need to get at a few things. Two American generals have lost their jobs as a result of this incident. They were in overall command but the attack took place in an area of the camp that was subject to British control. There were a number of unmanned towers. The Ministry of Defence agreed a week or so ago that there were 11 unmanned towers. There had been a number of incursions for scrap, or it was thought that they were for scrap. A number of questions have been asked about responsibilities for these vulnerabilities. The question that we will need to get at is whether there was any British responsibility for these vulnerabilities or whether it is only these American generals who should pay the price. Do you want to say anything about that overall question before we get into the detailed questions?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lieutenant-General </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Capewell</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Yes, I can do. First, I should refer to my opening remarks. This operation is a coalition operation. It has a coalition chain of command, the ISAF chain of command. Those two American generals were commanders of RC South West, and commanders in RC South West at the time. The whole footprint of Bastion, therefore, in those terms was their responsibility. I absolutely accept that there were British officers in that chain of command but none of those British officers were the direct commanders in the ISAF chain of command. It is important to understand that. This is a coalition operation. We pass control of UK forces—it is called operational control—to ISAF to command the operation. So tactical decisions on the ground are the business of the ISAF commanders. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">In so far as the general context of the footprint at the time—so to address the broad question of the towers—the towers were manned from a collective understanding of the threat at the time. There is a military dictum that he who defends everything defends nothing. So judgments were made at the time in accordance with the threat. As I have described—I hope clearly—the threat assessment at the time and the previous evidence of action on the ground did not indicate in any sense that there was an immediate or direct threat to the perimeter from a ground attack. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">It is important to get the context of this right.

Now, was that a perfect system? No. No system is, but that Executive Steering Group looked at and had the authority to make those sorts of recommendations. So the recommendations that they made at the time were collective recommendations and were agreed in theatre. My headquarters would not have played any part in making judgments about that. This will keep coming up today. It is the nature of coalition operations.

My understanding at the time was that there was the MOU, which was signed in 2011.

The Americans raised some concerns about how that was reflected in the MOU, and that was discussed by the Executive Steering Group, but I am not familiar with all the detail and the argumentation at the time. The Americans then raised that up to ISAF Joint Command (IJC), but it got pushed back. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">My recollection from the review is that it didn’t go any further at the time, and that was one of the points that the American accountability review raised.

It wasn’t from theatre to UK that that language was associated with. I can now see why you asked the question. This was an in-theatre process to address the MOU. These MOUs are looked at carefully by a number of parties, including lawyers and financiers, to make sure that they are deliverable from all aspects. They are looked at in theatre. Eventually, after they have been looked at in theatre, they come back for national scrutiny. They are not done quickly, and we would not want them to be done quickly. In the balance against risk and resource, our responsibility is to make sure that they are properly scrutinised. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q26</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> General </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Capewell</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">, you have described the 2011 MOU as very adequate.

Paul has pointed out that the ESG made some recommendations to ISAF and it pushed back. So this is not a UK push-back; this is IJC, which is a coalition headquarters, which has American commanders in it. This question of C2 is the key issue which confuses. There is not a red line to me for in-theatre tactical and operational issues. They have got to be decided by commanders on the ground in Kabul and in Helmand and through the rest of the theatre. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">You can see circumstances where a headquarters in Kabul, commanded by an American with a British deputy commander and a multinational staff, would look at all sorts of recommendations. This is a theatre which is dynamic and particularly dangerous in both the south-west and the east, and you can see why in the range of balancing risk against resource, on some occasions, things were pushed back and rejected, because there is not infinite resource. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Judgments had to be made at the time about this. It is easy, as you say, to look at this with hindsight, but people on the ground at the time would have determined to themselves that there were some shortcomings. They would have made judgments themselves about those shortcomings in the heat of battle and had a conversation about them with their higher headquarters. If higher headquarters do not deliver a resolution and do not give you more resource or more permission, then what you have to do as a commander—again, this is an important point—is adjust your own resources and take risks in other places. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">It is back to this: you cannot defend everywhere.

As General Bradshaw described, there are a range of causal factors, not one single factor. For instance, it wasn’t just the fact that there was little intelligence indication that this was going to take place; it was also about the breadth of responsibility and the resources available. I have to say that, in the aftermath and with hindsight, it’s clear that the arrangements were sub-optimal. At the end of the day, that’s why two American generals were asked to retire.

There were 16 to 18 remarks, and the principal ones were about the command and control arrangements—the nature of the way the ESG operated and the availability of some of the resources in the aftermath. I want to emphasise this now, and it will help with this point: as you recall, I said that during this period there were 37 bases in that area. I recall that you looked at Bastion and said, “Okay, is there any intelligence against Bastion? No. Any screaming demands for resources? Does this feel all right at the time? Yes.” Now look at everywhere else, where other people are dying and bases are being attacked. In my judgment about what commanders were thinking, they would have been thinking about those exposed bases elsewhere where there was a much greater demand for resources and which they were trying to make better. You can’t do everything simultaneously; you have to sequence resource and thinking. Was General Bradshaw right in the aftermath of this to suggest that it was “sub-optimal”? Yes. Did he point to the eventual US conclusion that the two generals failed to unify effort to ensure the protection of Bastion? Yes.

This is an important point. As general officers in command of RC (South West), you cannot abrogate responsibility to other people. I feel that every day. You have to ensure that, in your review of the whole problem—that is the problems in Helmand and the enemy problem against the bases—you take account of it all. Individuals cannot make judgments about the totality—the whole picture.

That vulnerability cannot be put down to a single item that failed. The single item that failed may or may not have had a British officer or serviceman in the chain of command, but fundamentally they could not make judgments about the whole picture. It is the business of general officers commanding in-theatre to make that judgment. That was why the US determined the outcome that they did. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> If your question is about service inquiries and all that, there are specific reasons why you conduct service inquiries. First, I cannot disburse a service inquiry. I am not empowered to conduct a service inquiry, because that is a single service issue. In a moment, Paul will explain the absolute point of law on this, but it is clear to me that on the basis that there was no UK death and no UK major equipment destruction, because all those Harriers were US Harriers, there was no prima facie case to conduct a service inquiry.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rimmer</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> That is right; I cannot add much to that. There are certain circumstances in which, by statute, a service inquiry has to be conducted, such as following the death of a serviceperson. They can be convened in circumstances not mandated by statute or policy at the discretion of the convening authority. CJO does not have the authority to convene a service inquiry. It was a question throughout, in a sense. As the ISAF review was looked at and people looked at lessons learned, somebody could have decided that they could convene a service inquiry, but the decision was made that the lessons had been learned. As CJO has explained, it was felt that there was no UK person who could be—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q45</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Bob Stewart:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> I take the point about general officer responsibility and I understand the concept of command very well. The fact is that they were responsible for what happened and therefore fell on their sword—or the sword was stuck in them. But there is also the concept of fault. They were responsible, but they may not have been at fault. My question really is: was anyone else at fault? Was there any fault in the system? It seems that there was.  We are not trying to blame anyone, because we know very well that no one sitting here is responsible, actually, but we are trying to find out what happened. We do not even want someone blamed, necessarily, but we do want to get to the bottom of this.

The Americans asked the obvious question of how the hell he got on the airfield. We start there, right? That is the “Burning Man” incident that starts things off. The consequence of that, as I understand it, is that the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, which is the Americans, and RC (South West) decide to have a look at this question. Then the UK co-ordination, along with the 3rd Marines and the anti-terrorist force protection officers, submit a project to deal with this question. It says they propose four courses of action and then the report goes black.

They denied this request on the basis of the cost and time to construct compared with the assessment threat. Later on the generals are sacked because they didn’t take additional command action, even though they knew about these things and they should have done something about it. What I want to know is what actually was done. You talk about an internal fence, but I think a lot of confusion comes from people talking about perimeters. There is the overall perimeter and then perimeters within the perimeter. You seem to be saying that they did do something about stopping the vehicular access to the runway and then they made some other adjustments. Were the other adjustments to the overall perimeter defence, or was this again just simply the perimeter of the runway process?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lieutenant-General </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Capewell</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> First of all, you have described in various bits of time and space a range of activities that has led to the conversation around risk and resource in many ways.

As you say, with the incident in March </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">2012, a</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> locally employed Afghan got into a car, got on to the runway and set himself on fire on the same day that the US Defence Secretary was arriving. I was in Camp Bastion on that day as well, in a different place, funnily enough. Clearly one of the issues that arose from that was how we make sure that vehicles don’t get on to the runway, either by accident or in a deliberate attempt if, say, someone from within the camp was able to drive a vehicle borne IED on to the runway where clearly there is potential to cause great damage and loss of life. As ever, engineers looked at the proposition. As you know with these sorts of things, there is never only one solution to it. They looked at a number of options. One of the options was doing nothing; other options included different types of fencing around the runway.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q49</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Havard</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> So one of the four courses of action was to do nothing and there were three others.

Lieutenant-General, you said heavily armed individuals attacked on a moonless night. I have watched lots of films about cowboys and Indians, and that is usually when these things happen—on a moonless night heavily armed insurgents try to get into the fort. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">The first problem it appears we had was that there had been, perhaps, a lack of attention to the fact that two settlements grew up close to the perimeter fence and that individuals were allowed to grow poppy, so they had an excuse to come right up to the fence to tend their fields. There were at least three known incursions into the camp in which the exterior fence had been cut open; indeed, there was video film of people coming through the Bastion fence and even going into the towers. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Let us take things right from the start and work our way through what we could have done, should have done and, perhaps in retrospect, were wrong not to have done. We are told throughout the report that people coming in and out of the camp were seen as “scrappers”. Has the UK learned a major lesson in terms of allowing potential access to exterior fence lines, allowing close access to the fence line, allowing incursions through the fence line and failing to respond to known incursions through the fence line? Were we wrong not to have addressed those things?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lieutenant-General </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Capewell</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> I think that question strikes at the very heart of a counter-insurgency campaign, which is what we are conducting in Afghanistan. It is an excellent question because it describes how difficult operations in those conditions are. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">At the edge of the camp, as you were right to point out, there were settlements, but those settlements were not cleansed. Imagine the circumstances in which you would have to find reason to do that. Those people were going about their normal day-to-day business. There was a mixture of criminality and silliness by children, and the last thing we want to do if we find a kid trying to get over a fence is to shoot him or her dead. In the balance of judgment at the perimeter level, you have not only to be absolutely sure that this is a terrorist intervention or an enemy intervention, but to make sure that, in determining that, you do not mistakenly kill an innocent person going about his normal business who may be high on solvents or who may just be mischievous. Some of those judgments are really difficult, and they are encapsulated in the rules of engagement, although I cannot go into the rules of engagement in detail. Soldiers face difficulties every day when trying to come to those judgments about whether or not an enemy threat is real.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">The circumstances at the time had these villages close. You are right that some poppy growing was going on, and the terrain was undulating, so the circumstances at the time—this is one of the causal contributions that the Americans identified—made it easier for the enemy to mingle in. You will also know, and I will go into more detail, that the enemy were much more clever than to take a moonless night and choose the hour. I cannot go into the details in this session, but I will show you how clever they were in the private session.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">On a daily basis—I am recalling 2012 now—you would have seen people very close to the fence. You would have seen people trying to pinch things from under the fence. As you rightly point out from that video, now and again somebody got through the fence. In those circumstances, on most occasions, the breakthroughs were dealt with more than adequately, because we have killed no children on the fence line. I must tell you, however, that an Afghan soldier was killed on the fence line as he tried to get over it coming back from leave. That is how difficult it is to come to judgments about the fence perimeter.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Now, in the sense of the context of the perimeter, operations were also being conducted in a much deeper sense, further away from the perimeter, that were designed to try to suppress as much of this activity as possible under the terms of the ROE. So the defence of Bastion should not be viewed, in any sense, as about just the perimeter; the defence of Bastion should be viewed in the complete context of operations at the time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">You will know—again, I can give more detail later—that we conduct operations at range from Bastion fence perimeter to ensure that none of our aircraft are interfered with as they approach the runway at altitude. So when you look at the whole problem of Bastion, you cannot look at it as about only the fence and encroachment. That in itself is a complex judgment for soldiers to make—is this a gangster, a child, a criminal or a terrorist? We can show you evidence of people breaking through the fence and then being arrested, as we have determined that they are just criminals trying to pinch things, and we have reacted adequately through the quick reaction forces available to us.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Choosing the moonless night was a very good start by the enemy, but it should be viewed in the context that I have just described. It was not the sole reason why they were successful.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q54</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mrs Moon:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> They were successful because they had a map. They knew exactly where they were going and all those coming close to the fence and standing up on top of the hills outside gave them a clear view of where they wanted to go.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lieutenant-General </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Capewell</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> That’s because of the locally employed people inside the camp who come in everyday. It is really hard to ensure that those people, when they go back home or elsewhere—to the marketplace—don’t reveal things to somebody who wants to cause damage. That is a constant problem that has not gone away. It will become more and more difficult over time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q55</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mrs Moon:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> General </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Capewell</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">, I have full sympathy for that, but in a sense, this is a British part of the complex, and Britain had an MOU that said we were in charge there. Coming through all the evidence from the Americans was that we were a bit sharp-elbowed about saying, “This is our bit of the base. We are in charge here—our rules.” Having said that, I appreciate that there was the additional problem that the Americans were going a bit softly, softly outside the fence because of the upset that had been caused by the video that had been distributed in the US, so some of the work that would have been going on in the villages was not going on.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">But you get through the fence, and the report says that the manning of towers 15 and 17 was inadequate and that it would be a questionable decision to man only those towers. That was for two reasons: there was no line of sight of the breach, but also—this is really quite significant—there was no rear sight over the area leading to the airfield. So once you got through the fence on a moonless night and once you were past the towers, there was nobody looking for people moving around until you got to the airfield. What is your view, because the Americans have said it was a questionable decision, it was our decision and that it was inadequate? They make quite clear accusations that we were inadequate in our coverage and were questionable in our decision making.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lieutenant-General </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Capewell</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> First of all, you can see the breach near one of those towers, tower 17. The fact that they got in under the wire was really a question of the </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">millilux</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> level and the darkness at the time. It is not a question of line of sight. It is a question of the darkness level. I have to tell you that everybody—every single person—in Bastion is responsible for force protection, because that is the only way you can come to terms with things like the insider threat. If you think that your perimeter is being looked after and is 100% perfect, that is an unsound military judgment, because everybody knows that eventually the enemy will find a way. It might not be through the perimeter. It might be because the man who is delivering the ice cream decides to turn against you on the day.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">So when it comes to the question about whether there was a rearward look, everybody in Bastion is responsible for force protection in some way, and I think I have already described to you the fact that we had QRFs—quick reaction forces—able to react if breaches occurred. We have ample evidence of that occurring—for instance, children being arrested and kicked out, or criminals being arrested and then dealt with. So I do not accept that there was no hinterland that was sensitive to this risk, because the evidence is to the contrary.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">American judgments about this in the aftermath are easy to make. I have already said that there were errors. I am very happy to say there were errors, but the errors singularly were not the reason why this attack was successful. The errors, when you look at them collectively and when they aggregate to a risk to Bastion protection, are  the issue that needs to be addressed. That is why the Americans came to the conclusion that they did.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q56</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mrs Moon:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Can I again take you back? I totally endorse everything you say about everyone having a responsibility for protection. That is absolutely right. But we are talking about late at night when the only people on guard are the guards in the tower, some people watching from overhead—you have some camera coverage—and one mobile patrol that was somewhere else and totally nowhere near. So the responsibility for the watching was very limited. It was largely down to the people in those guard towers. Yes, the Quick Reaction Force would have been there when they had something to react to, but nobody knew at that point.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">The next thing that is raised by the Americans is that the 3rd Marine Air Wing were not integrated in the UK force protection defence plan. So once you were past our guard towers, there was nothing to respond to until an attack took place, because no one was actually doing any guarding. There was another set of razor wire, which they cut their way through. We appreciate that they set off in three different directions, but they managed to do a heck of a lot of damage in an area under our control before the Quick Reaction Force knew that they were there. Why weren’t the 3rd Marine Air Wing integrated into that defence plan, and would that have made a difference?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lieutenant-General </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Capewell</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> I don’t think that the sort of modifications that you are talking about would have made a difference that night. This was a highly professional attack and some of the US reporting suggests that. Another fence or two would not have prevented this determined attack. I know that you have been on the ground, Mrs Moon. Remember that the distance between the outer perimeter and that bit of the airfield is very short in military terms. It is 500 or </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">600 metres</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mrs Moon:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> I think they describe it as </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">550 metres</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lieutenant-General </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Capewell</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Yes, </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">550 metres</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">, depending on which way you look at it. You can get across that sort of distance very quickly. These people were properly trained and very thorough. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">To address your point about integrating the 3rd Marine Air Wing and the associated risks, every subordinate commander has a responsibility for his own self-protection. This is why, at the end of the day, Major General </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Sturdevant</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> was asked to retire because, in the look at this, you cannot rely on everything being perfect. There were internal patrols all the time among the accommodation. They were designed to prevent insider threats. There was the QRF. To suggest that it was simply the perimeter guard towers and the next thing was Harriers on the runway and in crew accommodation, isn’t the right way to characterise this because, beyond the perimeter wire, out in the desert, there would have been other patrols. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">I can’t go into the detail of the surveillance capability that we have, but there was other oversight from surveillance assets. Internal from the wire to, let’s call it the concrete, there was very little—it was a short piece of desert. But inside the perimeter in other places, there would have been other patrols—local patrols to make sure that anything from people falling out of bed to being attacked by insiders hadn’t occurred. All that was going on, so I don’t think you can characterise this by, “It’s just a fence they got through and then they were into the jets.” That is not a proper characterisation of defences at the time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">In the aftermath of this, on reflection, was this proven to be adequate? No, it was not. That is why those generals were found to be lacking in responsibility, as the Americans found. They didn’t integrate the whole picture, and it is very clear that they should have. But were those errors at the time in minor terms—the fact that one tower wasn’t manned and the other was—part of the contribution to this failure? Yes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q57</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mrs Moon:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Can I have a very straight answer, please? You are saying that the two American generals were sacked because they didn’t integrate.

The point was made several times by various people who gave evidence to the US inquiry that the UK Force Protection Wing “did not employ a dedicated security force on the Camp Bastion perimeter. Instead, they relied on a ‘camp tax’” from UK tenant units. There was also criticism that perhaps part of the problem was the rapid turnover of British troops, so there was no longitudinal interest in the security of the camp. With the Brits who were there, you get somewhere with one set, they moved on and you had to start again. That was a second line of criticism. Will you comment on those two criticisms? Do you think they played any part in vulnerabilities on the site?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lieutenant-General </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Capewell</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Not in total. Let me explain. A longitudinal look at this is sometimes a disadvantage. What happens when you put troops on the perimeter is that there comes a point in time when they really begin to lose attention. In many ways, refreshing that is militarily advantageous. It keeps people sharp. While you noted that there was a camp tax, those people who were drawn from that tax were properly trained and put into those towers, so that they had the skills necessary, particularly if they were in towers, to deal with events.  Although you can argue that a longitudinal approach does deliver continuity, I can also argue, and my instincts are, that refreshing troops in static duties is a good thing to do, because imagine the circumstances where you are stood in that tower for a long time and you know that you going to do that for a long time.  That is not conducive to keeping your interest, but if you are constantly refreshed, that is conducive.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">There are a number of ways to skin this, and you have to leave that to judgments on the ground at the time.

From that atmospheric, I think that you can determine that, in any sensible person’s mind, that is sufficient to distract commanders, who were trying to come to terms with all these threats.  The fact that they got through in Bastion was not preceded by any intelligence warning, but the attack was delivered by a very, very  professional enemy, and I will show you how professional in the closed session.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">I guess I should also reflect on my final remark in my written statement, which is that I would offer my condolences to the American families who have suffered loss, and pay a tribute to the gallant act of those people who prevented further loss, both British and American.  When I show you the nature of this, you will see how brave they were in taking on a very professional enemy, who were also high on solvents. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair: </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">General, Mr </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Rimmer</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> and Dr Noble, thank you very much indeed.  We will now move into private session.  I would therefore ask the members of the public to leave.

We will write back to you explaining exactly the circumstances surrounding the development of the MOU. It did get a bit confusing about which MOU and at what point. I would just emphasise that the MOU in question, which was in development, was turned down by ISAF and the intermediate joint command. It was a chain of command rejection, not a UK rejection. We will come to that with a written note.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">I know you can all see the screen but, if you cannot read the screen, it might be helpful to refer to the slides as I go through this. Let us begin.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">My agenda is to go through the following. I will look at the command and control and talk a little more about Force Protection responsibilities and why that is difficult in coalition. I will then remind you about the intensity of the fighting, which will pick up a couple of questions on where commanders’ eyes were. I will then address what the enemy threat looked like. Next will be the “burning man” incident. I absolutely recognise the pejorative nature of that statement, but that is what is in the public record. I will then explain what Bastion has looked like over time—I know you have been there once or twice—so that you can get a feel for the absolute complexity of this. Then I will show you how thoughtful and clever the attack was. Next I will look at the sequence of reviews that have taken place to absolutely address the question of whether there was enough investigation.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Next slide, please. That slide, in itself, reflects upon the nature of the ISAF command and control, so that is the NATO command and control. From the top of the slide, the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe, through Joint Forces Command in </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Brunssum</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">, who have overall oversight of theatre activity, through the commander ISAF, his British deputy commander, into the intermediate headquarters, which is ISAF joint command, and then down through the chain of command into Regional Command (South West), where there is a British deputy, into the Marine Corps and into the US Marine Security Force.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">So that, I think, to anybody on the street looks like a pretty straightforward chain of command, and in many ways it is. But then, if you go to the next slide, you superimpose on it all the other different constituencies that a coalition command and control demands. In many ways, Eisenhower was right: coalitions are very difficult, but the only thing worse than a coalition is the absence of a coalition. I think this is why there are always compromises. History is replete with compromises that have to be made in coalition. When you superimpose the constituent parts of this—and this is not the full detail, it is just to give you a wave-top view of how complex the command and control arrangements were—it really does speak to the question, when you look at the left-hand side of the box, why a steering group was required to make sure that the risk and resource question across all the constituent parts of this architecture was taken into account. So that is just to give you a sense of the complexity of the command and control.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q73</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mrs Moon:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Before we move on, which way do you want to do it?

The black line is clearly the whole of Regional Command (South West) and, principally, the star with the one is the fact that this was commanded at Regional Command (South West) level. You may have seen phrases in some of the reports that talk about Task Force Belleau Wood and the marine headquarters, and you can see the location of that inside that black line—it is now the purple line—where our Expeditionary Air Wing was in star 3, where the US Marine Headquarters Group were in star 4, and where the Marine Air Wing were in star 5; note the vicinity and proximity of where that breach occurred. That just gives you a sense of geography to highlight the size, first of all, and then the nature of the constituent parts.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Next slide. Before September, as you have quite rightly questioned me on, a sequence of MOUs were in place. The 2011 MOU replaced the 23 September 2009 MOU, but it absolutely describes the nature of the NATO command and control and the national arrangements that underpin that. The national arrangements were expressed through the Executive Steering Group so that as far as is possible, and it is the last bullet on the left-hand slide, coherent Force Protection was delivered. It was overseen by the principal bodies therein.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">That MOU has now been annulled and, in 50:50 hindsight, the determination of the accountability review supports this; there is now a very simple line of responsibility to Commander RC (South West). *** still with Executive Steering Groups, but I think this addresses that point that you very clearly made about, could he have done something differently. Of course he could, and this slide addresses one of the things that was delivered in the aftermath.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">The next three slides really do come to terms with—and it is why in public I was so strong yet so reticent in detail—the nature of what was going on in Regional Command (South West). That slide makes the point, first, about the number of kinetic events at ***, and it shows the nature of them. It is my point about people being more worried about direct fire, indirect fire, IED explosions. It is the nature of the events and the number of casualties through that year that were out there. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">The bottom left describes the variations in district terms about the number of events in those districts. I think you can see where Bastion is placed. I will come to another slide in a moment that absolutely highlights why commanders’ eyes may have been focused on the ***, rather than worrying more ***. That is my judgment in aftermath; it was clearly different at the time. </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">[</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Interruption.</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">]</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> I am afraid we are going to have to go and vote.

I think this really does explain in close-up detail why people were not absolutely focused on Bastion as a firm base, but were focused on the nature of operations up the Helmand valley and where the incidents were.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">I think the one that reveals this best of all is the next slide. When you look at this, it shows you security incidents—it is not anything about casualty, but is about just any incident. The red dots are in the Helmand area and the yellow dots are in the Task Force Belleau Wood area, which is clearly the area of wider coalition responsibility. The graph on the right shows you the absolute difference between the level of incidents close up—in Task Force Belleau Wood it is the low blue line—against the level of security incidents in the rest of Helmand and other districts. So it does really draw out this point about what commanders were focused on.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Next slide. *** which is a constant irritation; and some form ***</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Now the assessment is prioritised differently. *** So you are a commander, and you have got so many geese biting your leg that you just do not know where to apportion the first boot.

I am now just going to make sure that this is in the right order in your slides. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> We have that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lieutenant-General </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Capewell</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Yes, you have the “burning man” incident.

It took place during the US Secretary of Defence visit and highlighted a number of vulnerabilities to the flight line, not the perimeter. It was looked at, as Mr </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Rimmer</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> has described, and we endorsed their requirement to put that best effort fence and </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">berm</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> in—</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">[Interruption.]</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">. Ditch and </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">berm</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">. That was done before the September incident. The project commenced on 24 August 2012 and was completed on 22 October. It is also useful to point out the relationship with the “burning man” incident, across the other side of the runway, in a different place to the fence.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">I think the next two slides really do show you—and it really refers to your earlier questions about the constituency of who was interested in their own security and why, and why there was an Executive Steering Group. On the first of this pair of slides, you can see the size of Bastion in 2006. I remember it; I was there. It was a dirt strip, a simple camp—this was real expeditionary operations. Before </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">2012, a</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> number of additional enhancements were made and they are annotated there on the slide and were certainly reflected on in my public statement. But there was quite a lot done to enhance the force protection prior to 2012. The *** is a good example of the technology we were beginning to apply between 2006 and 2012.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Next slide. This really does show you how big and complex Bastion has got; the constituent parts of it; the Afghan constituency of it; where this all expanded in terms of runway development; and the level of people now committed to the force protection effort in Bastion.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">I am nearly there. I have just a few more slides, to give you time for questions.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">I now want to really show you how clever and professional this enemy attack was. My first point is that, ***, we know they were trained in Pakistan; that planning had begun— *** and that they had managed to ***, so their operational security was very, very good. They had a detailed understanding of the Bastion layout. I recall your conversation about what the Secretary of State said, which was correct, but my judgment, in the aftermath of this, is that there must be some leakage here. They were heavily armed and they understood exactly the layout of the Bastion Camp.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">They had no escape or recovery plan and that tells you something as a military. They were absolutely prepared to die on site in this attack, so it was, for all intents and purposes, a suicide attack. I think the diagram on the right hand side shows you how they got in, where they made their penetration—I know you have seen this on the ground—and the nature of the geography of Bastion surrounding that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Next slide. I said they were high on drugs, but they were also in US uniform. So, Mrs Moon, this points to your question, “How could you have determined, in the middle of the night, even if you saw them, whether they were enemy or friendly?”—and they had got US uniform on. The green mark on the face of that enemy soldier, who was clearly killed, is evidence of drug abuse. That is what happens when you have used drugs and you die. It gives you a real insight into the nature of this. Also, you can see that they were not old men. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">As you have rightly pointed out, there were three approach routes. You can see that from the red dotted lines from where they mounted this attack ***; they knew what they were after. You can see as well where the UK and QRF operation to stop this getting any deeper into Bastion was successful. It was a very good and gallant action to get to those determined soldiers, who were clearly prepared to die.

I guess the point that I have been trying to make throughout is that if I thought that there was nothing to learn from this, we would not have made some changes in the aftermath collectively as a coalition and from some of our national perspectives in terms of lessons learned. What has happened since then—I think you have seen this on the ground—is that command and control has been unified. *** </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Next slide. This speaks to the nature of the reviews that were conducted. I think there is an impression publicly that we have done this lightly and have not considered it in detail. I think it is worth while looking at it from right to left. As the US accountability review developed and as it went through its drafting, we had insight into it with people in CENTCOM, and as it was developed in terms of the redaction process, a number of UK reviews were taking place at the same time. I was very clearly directed by CDS to determine whether there were any more lessons learned or there was anything in the new US reporting that caused me to be concerned about UK responsibility in any sense, and you have seen what is in public on that. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">There are a range of other reviews and reports that took place before any of that took place, and you can see the nature of how they developed over time, from September through April, in terms of the constant look at this to make sure that lessons learned had been captured and we had learned something from it. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">The result of all that is very clear, and it is on the next slide. Generals </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Gurganus</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> and </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Sturdevant</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> were accused of failing to take adequate force protection measures. The report in the Bastion accountability review is very clear. *** They were addressed for lack of defence in depth and for integrating the patrolling at their level, so this is a command-led issue that general officers are responsible for—not individual constituent parts, but a command-led issue that general officers are responsible for. All those causal factors contribute to why this vulnerability was discovered by the enemy. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">There were also some contributing factors, which the report is clear on. There was the question of underestimating the enemy—never underestimate the enemy. There was the lack of overall unity of command and effort—General </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Gurganus</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> did not deliver—and the lack of adequate command direction and oversight. In the aftermath of this, it is very easy to see these allegations for what they are, but I think at the time he would have been under lots more pressure for other reasons. The report is clear. They passed the report to us to determine whether we could learn anything else from it. You know our position and you know my position, because I am very sure about this: in terms of the commanders on the ground, there was no UK culpable failure on the part of UK leaders in Bastion.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">I hope that has been swift but thorough for you. I think in the round this tells us something about expeditionary operations and the command and control of large sites like this. This campaign is unique, in the sense that Bastion was built from sand in 2006. And it tells us something about the nature of coalition operations. We have learned something about that as this place has grown over time and become more complex and as the threat has changed over time and been very dynamic and very violent, as I have pointed out. It tells you something about the nature of how challenging getting the right command and control in place is.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">I think I have covered the difficult nature of the fight in 2012 and how it has modified over time into the fight it is now, in </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">2013, in</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> which we are showing much less flank on the ground. By “flank”, I mean we have many fewer bases there—there are five—and Bastion has been insured against another attack of this sort. But I should point out that you should never underestimate the enemy’s capability or his intent, and his intent is to do damage. His intent is to spoil the strategic narrative that we have successfully delivered the Afghan campaign *** Sixty-eight young men and women have died while I have been in command in PJHQ, and I think about it every single day.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Base force protection over time has been improved, as I hope I have described. I think it is also obvious that we have taken due care and consideration over all the reports. I have illustrated how wide ranging they are and how deep they are to demonstrate that we have been responsible in terms of making sure that there is nothing else to learn from this, so that in the round, we do our best—and we can only do our best—about protecting people for the last year of this campaign.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q74</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> General </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Capewell</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">, thank you.

What was your understanding in September at the time of the attack? Was the MOU request from the Americans to change the 2011 MOU to a new one—which gave them, in their eyes, overall control of Bastion, which they felt they did not have under the 2011 MOU—dead in the water and out of play or was it still operational?

The point of criticism is that when he took it back, he did not re-attack on that issue and make a bigger thing of it.

No, I contend that that is not the case. The reason why that attack occurred is because the enemy are clever. They got *** they used a moonless night, they had been trained in Pakistan for a long time, and they got through a range of levels of defences—like onion skins—to defend that perimeter.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q121</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Derek </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Twigg</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: Was that part of the fence, which you’ve just accepted was manned by British service personnel, in the part of Bastion which the British were responsible for under the MOU?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lieutenant-General </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Capewell</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> That part of the fence line, yes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Derek </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Twigg</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> That is in the MOU.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lieutenant-General </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Capewell</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Yes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q122</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Havard</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> The other part of the problem is beyond the perimeter fence and out into the Belleau Wood extended area.

There could be all sorts of people—I don’t want to know—who are in that area doing that *** and whatever it is, roaming about *** and so on.
