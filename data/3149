I then eventually moved onto installing and running some extremely large schemes, involving some very massive currents and systems of control, some of which were close to the £10m mark.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">My experience in the electrical industry I would describe as extensive as it is possible to be, ranging from domestic wiring to electronics and microprocessors, robotics to PLC’s.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Whilst winding down towards retirement, I took a job well below my usual level, but still in the industry I once loved. I had a 16</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:7.33pt; vertical-align:super">th</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> Edition and was offered a 17</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:7.33pt; vertical-align:super">th</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> Edition upgrade. A colleague had accepted the upgrade course, took it and related what took place during the one day course. It was basically a sham. One engineer whom I would describe as too dangerous to let loose near any sort of work, struggled with the answers. The instructor sat down beside him and fed him the correct answers. That company is now sending out that guy as a supposedly qualified engineer. With such going on, I refused to take part in such a sham of a course and complained to the City &amp; Guilds about the course. Short courses are great for those who already have the background understanding, but such short courses are also letting complete numpties loose in the world. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Yesterday evening I had a young relative supposedly Part P qualified helping me diagnose an issue on some car wiring. He was about to connect a meter set on the ohms range onto the vehicle, to check continuity, with the car’s battery still connected, so I stopped him. He could not understand at all why I had stopped him, just did not understand even the basics, yet was Part P qualified.    </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> It seems to me that many of those taking Part P qualifications often lack even the basic knowledge needed to deal with anything at all technical. Yet here I am for the most part unable, due to Part P, to legally do work in my own home and the idea is that I have to call a much less experienced person in to do it – what would have been called at one time a ‘simple House Basher’.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">I have very grave concerns as to where the electrical industry is going, with all of this sub-division for an entirely profit based motives. The JIB was at one time all the proof needed of being qualified to do the job. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The extra costs involved to the house owner as a result of Part P, will be even more of a  temptation to get an unqualified person in, or to have a go themselves.  </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
