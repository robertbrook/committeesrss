This protectionist approach can (and probably is) be used not only as a discrimination against foreign bidders but also against national bidders. When one looks at “local economy” from the perspective of a local authority what is being meant is simply the borders of </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">said entity</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">. There is, naturally, a vested interest in a local authority to promote its supplier base as it pays taxes locally, employs local people and generates value for other businesses in the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">area</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">. This is understandable and local councils are more than entitled to help suppliers through their business development arms. For example, regarding public contracts they can help them become more proficient in bidding by providing specific procurement training. However, that is different from steering the contracts the authority tenders to that specific supplier base. Unfortunately, some local authorities see procurement (and social considerations) precisely as a tool to help them steer contracts to their own supplier base and here lies the problem.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">              </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">EU law is quite clear in ensuring non-discrimination and overall demanding equal treatment for participants in public procurement. In fact, all EU rules in one way or another derive from this founding principle. As such, the (i)legality of the use of social considerations in public procurement as a development tool for local suppliers in contracts covered by EU law is obvious. However, even for </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">the remaining contracts it can be a bad </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">idea from an economic perspective. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The reason we have an internal market in the EU is to foster economic development. In a sense, when we look at the UK and the different home nations we see a mini-internal market in operation. Any supplier based in Wales has free access to public contracts in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Ensuring free competition between suppliers of different parts in the UK is the best way to obtain a competitive supplier base where the best grow and become able to win business elsewhere. It is the best way to generate long term economic development.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Unfortunately, promoting social considerations as a means to shelter local suppliers from external competition will lead to the opposite result. Perhaps in the short term there are indeed some apparent immediate benefits for the local economy, but the problem lies when every other local authority starts applying the same logic. When the first authority raises its barriers to external suppliers all others will be expected to do the same to protect their local supplier base.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> Something similar happens with the economy and savings: one people saving is great, everyone saving leaves the economy in deep trouble.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> In consequence, it will become almost impossible for a supplier to win business with another local contracting authority. We know that for years to come local authorities budget will at most remain unchanged and probably will be reduced</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> further in the near future</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">. In that scenario of diminishing budgets how will companies grow? The pie is only getting smaller not bigger. So not only in the short term the contracting authority may be getting a worse good or service by raising procurement barriers but in the long term it will be left with a supplier base to which it is the only buyer. Will those companies still be independent or in reality they are just another arm of local government then?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Protectionism is not and has never been a recipe for growth.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Another issue with social consideration in public procurement is the complexity they bring to a contract and the difficulties they impose on SMEs. Recently, I had the opportunity of talking with a SME providing electrical services. The owner expressed me his surprise by the demand from a contracting authority of said SME having to train apprentices as part of undertaking a services contract. The problem the owner faced was that while the contract was suppose</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">d</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> to last for one year, apprenticeships in that sector take four years to complete.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> How would he keep the apprentice in the following three years?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The example provided above is just an anecdote to illustrate two underlying problems. Firstly, imposing social considerations discriminate against SMEs as larger organisations have more scope to </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">accommodate these extra</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> requirements. Secondly, suppliers not only have to be experts in the subject matter of the contract (providing electrical services) but also on the social considerations (in this case, training). Again, this second problem also contributes to discriminate against SMEs as it is more likely they are able only to have the expertise for the main contract and may incur in extra costs to deliver the second part (ie, hiring external help or acquiring specific qualifications).</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><a name="_GoBack"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Ii) Long relationships with contractors</span></a></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The second point I would like to highlight in the first question raised by the Committee is the establishment of long relationships with contractors. As above</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> this question warrants a legal and a practical answer. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">From a legal perspective, EU law imposes certain limits on the duration of a contract for the benefit of the market. In general, any given contract covered by the EU Public Procurement Directive should be tendered every three years although some interpret the requirement as mandating tenders only every four years. In any case the principle is simple: every so often, a contract needs to be tendered. This ensures suppliers get regular opportunities to bid for work and the market is not f</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">oreclosed. In any case, during the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> duration of a contract it is important to have a good relationship with the contractor and manage the performance of the contract. Unfortunately, some contracting authorities still think the “procurer’s role” ends with award. That is a common misconception.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">In addition to the legal requirement, there is a practical answer why it is not good practice in public procurement to establish long relationships with contractors. In general, a contractor will know more about a certain sector than procurers as contracting authorities lose more and more in-house capability to undertake the services or works being procured. That is not necessarily bad but needs to be managed correctly. A good way to ensure a contracting authority has a “working knowledge” about any area of business is to take the effort of tendering it regularly. By going through the tendering process a contracting authority will refresh its knowledge and be brought up-to-date in that sector or area of business. Furthermore, the certainty of competition every now and then is a good reminder for contractors of the need to keep providing a good service. Having a longstanding relationship with a single contractor implies foregoing this exercise and as time goes by the authority will simply lose the ability to monitor the contract correctly. The authority will become more and more dependent on the knowledge of the contractor to the point that it may not be able to tender the contract well in the future.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:27pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Th</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">ere is another practical reason</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> why longstanding relationships with contractors are fraught with danger: asymmetrical information. On a longstanding contract, the contractor will develop more and more knowledge about the contract itself. The longer this process goes for, the bigger the risk that it will lead to a situation of asymmetrical information, whereby the contracting authority will no longer be able to monitor the performance of the contract correctly.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><br style="page-break-before:always; clear:both" /></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:27pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">2) The importance of regulating and standardising procurement for contracts below the EU thresholds</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:27pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:27pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:27pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">For contracts falling under the remit of the Public Sector Directive, Public procurement in the United Kingdom is subject to two sets of rules depending on value. If contracts exceed the EU thresholds then they are subject to the full regulation of EU law. Below thresholds, Member States are free to create any rules they see fit limited only by the obligations imposed by the EU Treaty principles. Currently, 75% of all contracts tendered in the UK have a value below the thresholds and as such not subject to full EU regulation. It is thus imperative to get the regulatory system for low value contracts right, something that currently does not occur.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:27pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:27pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">In the UK contracting authorities are in general free to develop their own practice on how to award such contracts. The exception</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">s</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> are contracting authorities controlled by central Government which are mandated to advertise all contracts above £10,000 on ContractsFinder. Local councils in all home nations do not have to follow such obligation and practice varies wildly. Although this flexibility allows for contracting authorities to devise their own practice, the cost is a lack of standardisation that makes life for suppliers more difficult.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:27pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:27pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Central Government was right in demanding the advertising of contracts above £10,000. Using a proper tendering mechanism such as the open procedure increases transparency and competition in the market, particularly at a price level that will cover most of public procurement. Until now, low value contracts were usually tendered through a request for quotes, whereby the contracting authority would just submit the opportunity to a select few suppliers. There are no legal rules imposing this solution but simply an ingrained practice.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:27pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:27pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">There are, however, some reasons why contracting authorities are not keen on advertising low value contracts. There is a perceived fear that they will be swamped with offers if the floodgates are not kept shut. Additionally, there is also a perception that using the open procedure for low value contracts makes no economic sense due to the transaction and opportunity costs.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:27pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:27pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Regarding the first risk, both our work done in Wales at the Institute for Competition and Procurement Studies (Bangor University) within the Winning in Tendering project and the data published by the Cabinet Office on ContractsFinder use shows this is a false question. When using the open procedure for small contracts contracting authorities are not swamped with bids.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:27pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:27pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Contracting authorities have, however, a stronger case in what concerns the transaction and opportunity costs imposed by the traditional open procedure. It simply makes no sense to take a practice that has been established for contracts above £100,000 and apply it to a reality ten times smaller. In essence, that is what central Government imposed on contracting authorities. Currently, the Cabinet Office expects contracts using the open procedure to be awarded within 120 days. That may be reasonable for larger </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">contracts but is unworkable in smaller ones. Furthermore, although some effort has been made to make the open procedure leaner it still remains long and cumbersome.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:27pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:27pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">At the Institute for Competition and Procurement Studies we have been working on a simplified open procedure since 2011 and piloting with three local authorities through the Winning in Tendering project.

Another pilot with County and City of Swansea is expected to start within the next few weeks. So far the response and take up has been very encouraging. We managed to reduce a 100+ pages document to just 16 pages and the timescales involved from the target of 120 days to just 38. It was possible to reduce the timescales to levels similar to a request for quotes by simply excluding from the procedure all that was not strictly necessary to award the contract. Asking for unnecessary or irrelevant information has a cost for both the supplier that needs to provide it and the contracting authority that will have to mark it.

In addition, other stakeholders in the authority such as risk managers and health and safety officials </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">have welcome the changes as it reduces their workload by focusing their analysis on the documentation of the winner only.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:27pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:27pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">It is hoped that the Welsh Government will adopt the simplified open procedure for contracts below the thresholds in 2014, but that does not solve the underlying problem of lack of standardisation of rules and practice across the UK. What is really necessary for the benefit of the market is the regulation of procurement below the EU thresholds, perhaps by taking the simplified open procedure and enshrining it in law. As we will be starting within the coming months the discussion on how to transpose the new Public Procurement Directives, the time is right to look at what is happening at the whole of the UK public procurement market and not only the top 25%.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">September 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:right"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
