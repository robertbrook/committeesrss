My understanding is that three of the approximately 37 exchanges that serve your constituency are providing a commercially-funded superfast service (</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Thirsk</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Malton</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> and </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Filey</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">) and a further one (</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Topcliffe</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">) may already have been upgraded as part of the North Yorkshire broadband project.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The large</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> majority of the rest of th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">e exchanges are planne</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">d for upgrade as part of the North Yorkshire project.

The Superfast North Yorkshire project is now well into delivery and has already provided superfast coverage to over 50,000 premises out of a total target of around 149,000. Roll-out of the current project is scheduled to be completed by September 2014.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">I am also pleased to say that DCMS has allocated a further £3 million of funding to the North Yorkshire project, to be matched against a further £5 million from Local Authority funding and the European Regional Development Fund. This will enable superfast coverage in North Yorkshire to go above 90 per cent of premises.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">However, some of the areas that you are concerned about within your constituency are among the most remote rural parts of the country. The Government recognises the need to extend coverage further and in the Spending Round in June, we announced a further £250 million of funding to extend superfast coverage to 95 per cent of premises by 2017, with local match funding, and we are engaging with the industry on how to reach 99 per cent of premises by 2018. As part of this, the Government is seeking to encourage interest from a wider range of suppliers. I am pleased to say that the North Yorkshire team is already engaging with DCMS on these proposals and I understand Ministers are confident that coverage in North Yorkshire will go significantly further than the current plans.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Finally, you also referred during the sessi</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">on to the National Audit Office’</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">s (NAO) report on the delivery of the rural broadband programme. While we would have welcomed greater competition, it is important to recognise that the NAO concluded that the approach we have put in place has reduced cost and has transferred risk to the private sector. The NAO also said that the mechanisms in the contracts with the supplier to manage costs during implementation appear to be robust. You might like to compare this approach with the project initiated by the previous government in South Yorkshire, which has been an object lesson in how not to deliver broadband projects even though it appeared to generate more competition.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">4 October 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
