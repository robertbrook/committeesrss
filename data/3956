The strategy, which was developed in partnership with industry and academia, sets out a vision and course of action to enable the UK to be at the forefront of extracting knowledge and value from data. The strategy looks at the UK’s capability to make best use of data, and contains a range of actions for government, industry and academia around three key areas: </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 1.85pt 28.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Building human capital – developing a strong skills base in the UK, able to manage, analyse, interpret and communicate data, as well as data-confident citizens. </span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 1.85pt 28.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Developing our data infrastructure, software &amp; research – ensuring the UK has a data infrastructure, which includes the tools and techniques to enable the safe storage and interrogation of data to derive value and insight, as well as ensuring the UK seizes the opportunity to be a world leader in research and development of data science and big data. </span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Facilitating data sharing and linking – exploiting the significant opportunities and benefits which can be achieved from sharing and linking datasets, where appropriate protections have been put in place, to gain new insights and develop new products and services. </span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The strategy is not intended as an end point, but is instead the start of an ongoing commitment by government to continue to work with industry and academia on this important and growing agenda. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The strategy does recognise that, with increasing amounts of data being produced, the government must continue to develop the skills of its own workforce in handling and analysing data.

Increasingly we are seeing departments consume their own and other departments’ data to drive their policies and programmes. The Department for Transport uses a mixture of their own data and private data to support projects such as Transport Direct and an initiative to understand the impact of better information about incidents on the A4. The Department for Communities and Local Government’s Whole Place Community Budgets and Troubled Families programmes have shown that information sharing is key to designing and delivering services and achieving better outcomes for vulnerable people. In addition, the government run website, police.uk (run by the Home Office) uses both Home Office and Ministry of Justice data to provide an informative and valuable service for the public. As the</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">skills and capability develop, so will the departmental understanding and use of open data. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Supporting economic growth and the open data ecosystem </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">One of the main objectives for this agenda is the stimulation of economic growth through the exploitation of open data. The UK’s open data portal, data.gov.uk, is an interactive platform that allows users to engage with the datasets. The Open Data User Group represents the views of a broad community and provides the business case for the release of open data for economic growth. The Public Sector Transparency Board now has a greater focus on the needs of the business community and the departmental transparency sector boards convene both users and owners to ensure that the value and benefit of releasing open data is communicated. There are extensive interactions between civil servants and the open data community both in person and via social media which all help increase the understanding of what support is needed to enable economic growth. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The creation of the Open Data Institute, founded by Professors Sir Tim Berners-Lee and Sir Nigel </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Shadbolt</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">, was a substantial effort to stimulate potential economic growth and </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">familiarity with the wider open data agenda. We are investing £10 million, through the Technology Strategy Board, into the Open Data Institute - the first Institute of its kind in the world.

These programmes include the Open Data Challenge Series which will provide over £1.2 million to support companies developing new products and services which will address societal and sector challenges, and a £1.5 million Innovation Voucher programme (managed by the Technology Strategy Board) which will assist SMEs in working with new suppliers to develop new business ideas using open data. We have also set up a £5 million Breakthrough Fund to help government departments and local authorities tackle short term technical barriers that are holding back the release of data. This fund will result in more data becoming available that can be commercially exploited by businesses. In addition, there is a fund that was previously managed by the Data Strategy Board and has now transferred to the Public Sector Transparency Board which allows the government to purchase additional data for free release, based on business cases put forward by the Open Data User Group. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Trading Funds </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The 2011 Autumn Statement announced the creation of the Public Data Group (PDG), a group of Trading Funds (Companies House, Land Registry, Met Office and Ordnance Survey) tasked with working with the Data Strategy Board (DSB) initially to maximise the value of the data they hold, as well as working together to identify synergies and opportunities to collaborate among the members and with the wider public sector.

The ONS conducted a valuable exercise in quality assuring addressing data collected by different bodies. Since the 2011 census, </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">GeoPlace</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> has been set up. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">GeoPlace</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> has been established to provide definitive sources of publicly owned spatial address and street data.

It is a misconception that the data has been destroyed or lost. ONS’s work has helped with the development of </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">GeoPlace</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> as an authoritative source of addressing data. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Privacy </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The government’s position is that data should be open by default. By definition open data is not personal data. The government takes the issue of privacy seriously. Our work is underpinned by the Data Protection Act, and releases from departments are handled by statisticians working to a professional code. The Information Commissioner’s Office provides this guidance which all departments use to ensure that data is appropriately </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">anonymised</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">. These </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">anonymisation</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> techniques mean that data can still be released while providing protection to the individual citizen, e.g. crime data is grouped at the level of a few streets to prevent victims being identified. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The Committee asked us specifically about medical data. Following on from the publication of the Department of Health's Information Strategy last year, Jeremy Hunt set a challenge in January for the NHS to go paperless by 2018. Embracing the many benefits that technology can bring will enable NHS staff to spend more time with patients not paperwork and provide patients with the 21st century services they expect. Appointments, prescriptions and test results can and should only be a click away. Records, which help patients work in partnership with their doctor to manage their care, also need to be easily accessible. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The government asked Dame Fiona </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Caldicott</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> to lead an independent review to see how best to balance the need to keep patient information secure with the need to share it among health and care professionals for legitimate reasons. The review, </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Information: To Share Or Not To Share?</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">, was published on 26th April 2013. It looked at how to strike the right balance between sharing people’s health and care information to improve health outcomes and </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">respecting the privacy and wishes of the patient with regard to their sensitive personal information. The government’s response to the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Caldicott</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> review was published on 12th September and can be found at </span><span style="color:#0000ff; font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">www.gov.uk </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">by searching for ‘</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Caldicott</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> response’. The response accepts the recommendations of the original report and confirms again that while information sharing is essential to provide good care for everyone, only the minimum amount of information should be shared and there must be strict rules to govern it. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">In terms of health and care medical records the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) collects both </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">anonymised</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> and patient identifiable data depending upon the business requirement. Provisions in the Health and Social Care Act 2012 are designed to strengthen and clarify the role of the HSCIC, so that information can be collected, held securely and made readily available to those who need it in safe, de-identified formats, with crucial safeguards in place to protect the confidential data it holds. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Whilst the effective sharing of patient information as part of someone’s care is almost always essential and there is enormous potential and laws that allow this information to be used to improve services and treatments, patients should be given a much greater say over how their personal information is used beyond their care. Any patient that does not want the personal data held in their GP record to be shared with the HSCIC will have their objection respected. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">However, the HSCIC is required to make available all the data it collects available in large aggregated, </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">anonymised</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> datasets to allow others to use it for analysis.
