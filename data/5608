The recent political noise may create a lot of ‘heat’ for some, but it does nothing to heat the homes of the fuel poor. The plasters and platitudes approach of Government isn’t working. Business as usual simply won’t do.” He added: “It is time for all political parties to unite, stop playing politics and join forces in the interests of the most vulnerable in our society.</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic"> The only sustainable solution to end the misery and health inequalities of living in a cold home is to improve its energy efficiency through insulation measures.

This is where we need a frank conversation about what is putting bills up…..What we need to do is recognise that there are four bits to an energy bill: the wholesale prices, which are beyond our control; the costs of transmission and the grid, which are difficult to change; the profits of the energy companies; and the green regulations. It is those last two that we need to get to grips with. So I can tell the House today that we will be having a proper competition test carried out over the next year to get to the bottom of whether this market can be more competitive.

Whilst this was entirely welcome, the focus of the so-called ‘Green Levy Review’ appeared to be focused exclusively on the Warm Homes Discount Scheme (which pro</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt">vides</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt">low income pensioners with an automatic rebate</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt"> on their bills and other vulnerable groups can get access to rebates) </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt">and the Energy Company Obligation (the principal policy to enable low income and vulnerable households in England to benefit from energy efficiency measures). </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt">Therefore, whilst NEA welcomed the intention to address the necessary balance between energy, social and industrial policies that can either continue to be funded regressively by all energy consumers or potentially be funded via direct taxation, the exclusive focus </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt">on </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt">programmes</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt"> that support fuel poor households (and which will help many households directly reduce their energy bills this winter) was, at best, perverse.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt">Energy efficiency is the most cost effective way of reducing the risk of fuel poverty and domestic carbon emissions. Focusing on cutting or dramatically modifying existing energy efficiency programmes was therefore the wrong short term solution. UK household expenditure on gas and electricity has doubled from £15bn per annum to £30bn a year since 2003</span><a name="_ftnref3"></a><a href="#_ftn3">[[3]]</a><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt">. It was therefore wrong to prioritise a cut in the only programmes that can help to reduce household expenditure (for wasted energy) and keep vulnerable households warmer in their homes. Instead, the UK Government should be massively expanding resources directed to this area, especially for low income households living in the worst properties and deprived areas, as they fall far short of what is required to protect the health and welfare of these households or more generally bring about the scale of investment required to address our aging and thermally inefficient existing housing stock</span><a name="_ftnref4"></a><a href="#_ftn4">[[4]]</a><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt">. The ambiguity over this area has now created a hiatus in providing direct assistance to vulnerable households and has further damaged the insulation and heating industry which is still suffering from the loss of the Warm Front scheme in January</span><a name="_ftnref5"></a><a href="#_ftn5">[[5]]</a><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt">. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt">Of far greater concern to households (and therefore Government) should be the most regressive levy, the carbon floor price (CFP). The CFP scheme should have been considered and reformed as a priority as a result of the Green Levy Review. Together with the auctioning of EU emissions trading scheme permits to fossil fuel generators, </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt; font-weight:bold">the CFP will raise around £2 billion in 2013 rising to nearly £7 billion by 2027, an average of £4 billion per year for the Exchequer</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt">. Whilst both these measures will lift the market price for energy (and hence the consumer will almost certainly pay more in the short to medium term), the CFP contributes to no overall carbon emission reductions. The Government should therefore accept that, if the CFP has to be retained (as Government has indicated that by removing the programme altogether this may require higher Contract for Difference payments), the revenue from the CFP must be recycled back into a much more ambitious energy efficiency programme. This in turn would lessen the concern that UK energy consumers are paying over the odds for the price of carbon compared to the rest of Europe at a time when low carbon generators are also receiving a lucrative windfall (whilst the Treasury directly benefits from the proceeds). </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt; font-weight:bold">By redirecting this funding it could substantially reduce fuel poverty and bring about a major opportunity for further jobs within the energy efficiency industry.</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt">In addition, the majority of the costs of the Government’s Electricity Market Reforms (EMR) are likely to be recovered through electricity bills. The Government has therefore already confirmed that funding raised from levies on consumer energy bills, under the Levy Control Framework (LCF), will rise to £7.6bn in real terms in 2020/21 and could equate to £9.8bn a year when the final limit is set in nominal terms on revised ONS and OBR numbers. The LCF budget is currently circa £2.35 billion. Given recent developments to the EMR policy package (the impact of the extension of the Feed in </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt">Tariff regime from 5 to 10MWe, the likely Contract for Difference (</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt">CfD</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt">) exemption package for energy intensive users, access for low carbon generators to access </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt">CfD</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt"> support through Final Investment Decision enabling process, the development of the capacity mechanism and the longer than expected </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt">CfD</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt"> periods) it is critical that the Government also recognises and addresses these escalating costs. A transparent and effective levy control framework should aim, at a minimum, to set a robust and comprehensive cap on all EMR’s energy and industrial policies which continue to be funded directly by energy consumers. In addition, if the Government wish to avoid the perception that they are directly benefiting from their policies to fund energy, social and industrial policies via energy consumers, the Coalition should cut or pledge to recycle all VAT revenue which is currently paid on all energy consumer funded levies from now on.</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt">Finally, the planned exemption for energy intensive users from the costs arising from Contract for Difference must also be considered an urgent priority and funded out of taxation or cut altogether. The Government has already developed an exemption for certain energy intensive industries from the Carbon Price Floor and EU Emissions Trading Scheme. These are paid for via taxation and therefore are more progressive. Now however, energy intensive industries may be able to offset their share of the substantial additional costs arising from DECC's new-long term ‘contracts for difference’. Whilst competitive industry is clearly important to the UK Government, this additional step will have a cost elsewhere and is likely to be funded by other energy consumers. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="line-height:14pt; margin:0pt 1.4pt 8pt 0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt; font-weight:bold">Summary of recommendations</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol type="I" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 23pt; padding-left:13pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt">The Prime Minister needs to declare a strategic intent for an ambitious fuel poverty strategy that will seek to reduce the number of excess winter deaths and for it to be a multi-department initiative led by DECC.</span></li><li style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 23pt; padding-left:13pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt">The Government need to urgently provide precise clarity on the details of the new arrangements following the Autumn Statement. </span></li><li style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 23pt; padding-left:13pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt">The Coalition should pledge to recycle all VAT revenue which is currently paid on all energy consumer funded levies. </span></li><li style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 23pt; padding-left:13pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt">Cutting or dramatically modifying existing energy efficiency programmes was the wrong short term solution.
