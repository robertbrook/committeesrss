This event had already been arranged to provide an induction for the five new committee members appointed in the previous autumn and as an opportunity for the Committee to take stock, midway through the Parliament, of what we have achieved to date and to identify priorities for the remainder of the Parliament. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">We agreed a number of steps to improve effectiveness, particularly in relation to drawing up inquiry terms of reference, conduct of oral evidence sessions, and making meaningful recommendations that would encourage a positive response from Government.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">A further opportunity for assessing effectiveness in relation to evidence sessions was provided in June when a professional trainer provided a seminar on questioning skills.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Examples of where we have demonstrated increased effectiveness are set out below under the relevant Liaison Committee core tasks.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">We have also moved to paperless distribution of committee papers, which has contributed to the effective conduct of meetings. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><h2 style="margin:6pt 0pt 12pt; page-break-after:avoid; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">STRATEGY </span></h2><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Every major policy area within the Department for Work and Pensions has been the subject of significant reform under this Government.  In carrying out our inquiries into these reforms, a central focus has been the capacity of the Department to deliver the changes. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><h3 style="margin:6pt 0pt 12pt; page-break-after:avoid; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Universal Credit</span></h3><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Examples during the last year include a report on Universal Credit implementation in autumn 2012. This wide-ranging reform of working-age benefits has huge implications for DWP delivery and operational systems. We made a number of recommendations about the timetable and arrangements for UC implementation, particularly in relation to the impact on vulnerable benefit claimants</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">The report was followed up in a ministerial oral evidence session on 10 July, at which the Secretary of State announced major changes to the implementation timetable for UC. This provided an immediate opportunity for us to explore the planning and resource consequences with him. In advance of the evidence session, we had visited the UC Pathfinder in North West England. This enabled us to gather very useful information from DWP staff, benefit claimants, local authorities and welfare advisers about how UC implementation was operating in practice. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">A further follow-up session is scheduled for December which will take account of the critical NAO report on UC implementation published in September. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><h2 style="margin:6pt 0pt 12pt; page-break-after:avoid; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">POLICY </span></h2><h3 style="margin:6pt 0pt 12pt; page-break-after:avoid; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">The Work Programme</span></h3><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Another key policy reform was the introduction in 2011 of the </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Work Programme</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">, the Government’s mainstream contracted employment programme for long-term unemployed benefit claimants. Our 2011 report on the contracting arrangements for the programme had highlighted concerns that the new service might not be effective for the “hardest to help” groups of long-term unemployed people and people with health conditions and disabilities. Our 2013 report confirmed that this was the case, whilst acknowledging that the Work Programme was effective for the majority of jobseekers who were closer to the labour market.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">The Government’s Response to the 2013 Report was perfunctory in places and failed to address a number of specific recommendations. We decided that, instead of publishing a further report commenting on the response, a more effective means of addressing this would be a Westminster Hall debate, given that an early opportunity for this was available. The debate in October allowed the Chair to challenge the Minister on the weaknesses of the response and for committee members and others to highlight key concerns about delivery of the policy.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><h3 style="margin:6pt 0pt 12pt; page-break-after:avoid; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Workplace pensions</span></h3><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">An example of an effective response to emerging policy was in relation to the operation of the National Employment Savings Trust (NEST), the body established by the Government to support implementation of automatic enrolment into workplace pensions. In the middle of our comprehensive inquiry into the governance of workplace pension schemes, the Government launched a consultation on the restrictions under which NEST currently operates. We had previously commented on the desirability of lifting these restrictions in our 2011 report on automatic enrolment. We built on this previous work, using evidence submitted to the governance inquiry, to produce a short, focused report in time to inform the DWP consultation. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">The broader Pensions Governance inquiry was also effective in drawing the Government’s attention to concerns about occupational pension schemes. DWP took action to address issues raised in the oral evidence even before we had reported and has since taken further steps to address deficiencies in transparency and levels of pension charges, and in the way some pension schemes are governed and administered. The Government has now initiated a consultation on capping charges in workplace pensions, which was one of our key recommendations. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><h2 style="margin:6pt 0pt 12pt; page-break-after:avoid; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">EXPENDITURE AND PERFORMANCE </span></h2><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">We held our regular evidence session on the Departmental Annual Report and Accounts (ARA) for 2011-12 with the Permanent Secretary and other officials in November 2012. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Our attempts to scrutinise the 2012-13 ARA have been undermined by the failure of the Department yet to publish them. This delay has arisen as a result of the problems with Universal Credit implementation mentioned above, the timing of consequential decisions within Government about the extent of the write-off UC IT expenditure, and the difficulties this presents to the NAO in signing off the Accounts . An evidence session with the Secretary of State and Permanent Secretary was scheduled first for September and then for November. We now understand that the ARA will be published in late November, and the Secretary of State has given a firm commitment to appear before us in December. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><h2 style="margin:6pt 0pt 12pt; page-break-after:avoid; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">DRAFT BILLS </span></h2><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">We</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> had been anticipating scrutinising the Government’s plans for State Pension reform, to be set out in a </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">White Paper and </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">draft Pensions Bill, since early 2012. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">T</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">he draft Bill was </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">eventually </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">published in January 2013 and we were</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> asked</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">by the Government t</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">o report by the end of March</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> so that the Bill could be presented at the beginning of the new session in May</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">We commented </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">in our report</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> on the impact on the pre-legislative process </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">of this </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">changing timetable and </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">short deadline</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">. We also highlighted that the Government had changed</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> the implementation date </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">for State Pension reform </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">(from April 2017 at the earliest to April 2016) very late in the scrutiny process. We emphasised that it is </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">very difficult </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">for parliamentary committees to conduct effective scrutiny when the Government makes significant changes to reform proposals after the evidence-taking has concluded and so close to the deadline it has itself set for the scrutiny process to be completed. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Despite these obstacles, we published our report by the agreed deadline. Our scrutiny of the draft Bill was effective in that the Government responded to a number of concerns raised in oral evidence and in the report, including by making more information publicly available about the impact of the reforms on different groups of future pensioners. The report and the Government Response were available to the House for the Second Reading of the Pensions Bill in June. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><h2 style="margin:6pt 0pt 12pt; page-break-after:avoid; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">EUROPEAN SCRUTINY </span></h2><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">We took oral evidence on the EU’s proposals for changes to occupational pensions in the early summer of 2012. There was a high level of consensus across Government, the pensions industry, employers and trade unions that the EU’s proposals would have a detrimental impact on the UK. We were able to put these points to EC officials when they came to give evidence at Westminster. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">We also engaged in the Government’s Review of the Balance of Competences between the EU and the UK. We met the Minister of Employment in July 2013 to discuss the background to the DWP element of the process, the R</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">eview of Free Movement of Persons</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">. Our discussions covered the complex and controversial issues around entitlement of non-UK EU citizens to claim UK benefits. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">SUPPORT FOR THE HOUSE </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">The support provided to debate in the House by our report on the Draft Pensions Bill in May 2013 and the Westminster Hall debate in October on our Work Programme report are noted above. Our November 2012 report on Universal Credit was launched by the Chair on the Floor of the House, making us one of the first committees to take advantage of this new opportunity for publicising reports. Our report on reform of Disability Living Allowance and the introduction of Personal Independence Payments was debated in Westminster Hall in October 2012. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><h2 style="margin:6pt 0pt 12pt; page-break-after:avoid; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT </span></h2><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">We have found open public meetings to be a very effective way of engaging with members of the public affected by welfare reforms. It is invaluable to hear first-hand how claimants expect reforms to affect them and we will continue to use public meetings to gather a wider range of views than it is possible to gain through formal written and oral evidence</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">We ensure that all the visits we undertake include meetings with benefit claimants and other users of DWP services. Most recent examples of this include our inquiries into: Youth Unemployment when we met young unemployed people; the Work Programme, when we met homeless people; and the Role of Jobcentre Plus when we met a range of benefit claimants in the North West. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">We now publicise committee activities on Twitter and use our website actively to raise public awareness of the Committee’s work. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">6 November 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
