Her salary is therefore not allocated to a single source but apportioned across a number of different income streams, compliant with donor restrictions, to reflect the diverse activities of her role. This is common practice across charities. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Christian Aid receives donations for its work from a number of different sources including individual donors, Trusts, Foundations, Governments (including UK AID, Ireland AID, EU and USAID) and </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">corporates</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">. This funding comes with varying levels of restrictions on its use according to the wishes of the donor. Our 2012/13 Financial accounts report that 85.6% of our funds are spent directly on our charitable purpose, 13% on fundraising and 1.4% on governance. The CEO undertakes work across all three of these areas and as such different funding sources may make contributions to the overall funding for the CEO. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">2.

The report also includes the publication of its Remuneration policy which states our adoption of the Hutton Fair Pay Review recommendation on executive pay. We have in place a ratio of 1:4 that limits the highest paid member of staff based on the median salary paid to our staff in the UK. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">This report is available on our website, but the Select Committee raised the question as to whether we should do more to make sure this information is readily accessible to our supporters and donors.
