The flexibility of the degree allowed me to focus my courses in the area of Marine Sciences and conservation excelling in the following courses: Marine Biology, Marine Ecology and Biodiversity, Marine Microbiology, and Conservation. I am currently preparing for a 2 month trip to Cambodia where I will be working with Marine Conservation Cambodia studying a research internship in Marine Conservation with the hope to be accepted by the University of Exeter to study MSc Conservation and Biodiversity beginning September 2014. In my time at Royal Holloway I completed a dissertation in form of a scientific literary review on the use and efficacy of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) focusing on their design (size and number), implementation and monitoring. I am supplying extracts of my dissertation with hope that you  might be able to draw conclusions on the need and importance of more MPAs in the UK.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Establishing the objectives and goals of all stakeholders and their continued involvement throughout the design and implementation process is crucial to success.</span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">There is often an optimal size that will benefit all stakeholders. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Halpern</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> in 2003 </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">showed that the proportional effect of the marine reserve is independent of size</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">in a review that gathered evidence from 89 different studies in order to assess the impact of marine reserve size (investigating multiple biological parameters).</span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The greater number of reserves, the greater benefit to stakeholders.  It increases ‘spill-over’ and the ‘edge effect’ for fishing activities whilst also allowing the establishment of replicate populations therefore increasing adaptability and covering of wider selection of habitats.</span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The implementation should involve all stakeholders and a clear monitoring plan should be created where future monitoring is consistent and scientifically sound. </span></li></ul><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Throughout conducting my research a clear multistep process was apparent when establishing marine protected zones; establishing the objectives and goals, identifying suitable locations, determining size, as well as number and distribution and lastly, the implementation and </span><a name="_GoBack"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">monitoring (NAS, 2004; </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Airame</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> et al., 2003).

Stakeholders may include conservationists and scientists, fisheries and other businesses as well as the local community itself. The goals and objectives of individual stakeholders are often different and can therefore cause conflict as all groups aim towards sustainability at the maximum benefit or lowest cost (National Academy of Sciences, 2001); however what stakeholders want to ‘sustain’ often differs. For example conservationists may want to protect large areas by ‘no-take’ reserves in order to protect unique or threatened ecosystems whereas large commercial fishing businesses will argue against this as the area of lost fishing ground would be too great for their business to be sustainable (Klein et al., 2008) as fisheries must rely on marine reserves to supply sustainable levels of adults and larvae to areas that are not within reserves by natural mobility and dispersal rates (</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Halpern</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">, 2003). Therefore the reserves must cover a significant proportion of total stock area; an optimal coverage has been estimated from 20-50% depending on fishing pressure and other factors such as the mobility of the target catch (Roberts et al., 2003; National Academy of Science, 2004). These differences have often led to controversy, especially between the users of marine resources under management, and many fishing and commercial industries argue that reserves are not designed, located or evaluated correctly (</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Agardy</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> et al., 2011); although </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">there is some evidence of this within scientific literature, as some reserves were established rapidly in order to protect an ecosystem against a serious known and imposing threat, most reserves now follow a comprehensive planning and management strategy. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Halpern</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> (2003) </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">describes opposition of marine reserves to have resulted from a lack of understanding, an ignorance of significant questions that need to be asked and answered.

Many suggest that ‘bigger is better’ (</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Nursey</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">-Bray, 2011) and</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">following McArthur and Wilson’s work </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">on island biogeography in 1967 it is assumed that the greater the area, the greater species diversity, however this theory does not describe the potential influence of protection on biodiversity at a specific location, and I have already highlighted the potential conflicts that may occur due to large reserves. Due to these contradictions and the scepticism by many that current marine reserves are too small, there is a large amount of scientific literature studying the effect of marine reserve size on their success. One of the most extensive studies into this topic was carried out by </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Halpern</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> in 2003</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> and consisted of a review into empirical evidence gathered from 89 different studies in order to assess the impact of marine reserve size on biological measures such as biomass, biodiversity, organism size and density. The results of this review were particularly surprising as they showed that the proportional effect of the marine reserve is independent of size. This can be illustrated with the smallest reserve studied measuring just 0.026km</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:8pt; vertical-align:super">2</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> (St Lucia), this small reserve showed the doubling of biomass per unit area which is also observed in larger reserves. However it is important to consider the fact that the independence of marine reserve size on effect is relative. It is true that smaller reserves can be as successful as larger reserves, but this indicates a greater absolute increase in success for larger areas e.g. doubling the number of fish in a small reserve may be the equivalent of a population increase from 100 to 200, whereas larger reserves encompass a larger area and therefore will consist of larger populations, the equivalent therefore being nearer to an increase in population size from 10000 – </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">20000 (</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Halpern</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">, 2003; </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Halpern</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> &amp; Warner, 2002). </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">This evidence shows that how effective protected areas can be and their importance to marine conservation. The final process when determining the size of a marine sanctuary is to add an insurance factor which consists of adding a percentage ~1-5% more of protected areas on top of that already decided, if exposed to unforeseen catastrophes this insurance factor will increase the chances of some preserved and unaffected habitats allowing the reserve and those organisms living inside a greater chance of survival and adaptability (Roberts el al., 2001). </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Number and distribution of reserves</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Determining the number and distribution of reserves is closely linked with determining the size of marine reserves and has been a subject of controversy since the beginning of marine reserve implementation. For example the question of ‘single large or several small’ often abbreviated to ‘SLOSS’ has been discussed for many (National Academy of Sciences, 2001). However this is a terrestrial application and yet again does not consider many aspects unique to marine systems. For example, in marine systems boundaries do not consist of structures that prevent movement and therefore boundaries may be blurred. This also means organisms are able to live in-between protected areas </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">(Roberts et al., 2003).</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> However if all marine aspects are considered it offers an approachable question that can be used by design planners. Many aspects that are used to answer the SLOSS question have already been described in detail throughout other sections of this report (e.g. dispersal rates). The staggering range of dispersal rates of marine organisms can be incorporated thoughtfully into marine reserve design by establishing multiple protected areas at varying distances from each other. These distances and positions should also consider oceanographic factors such as currents that may form dispersal routes. This approach may be more representative of the area and offers an effective way to achieve large scale control whilst at the same time allowing the customised protection of zones within the larger area.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Table 2 (see </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">attached)</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">displays criteria set out by the IUCN, describing the levels of protection available for MPAs. It shows that critical habitats may be protected by no take zones whereas other areas may have restricted use only increasing the likelihood of achieving the stakeholder’s multiple objectives. This method would also increase the benefits to the artisan fishermen, as well as commercial fishing industries as many reserves moderately spaced would increase the fish stocks, as well as forming more ‘edges’ at which greater benefits (i.e. more fish) can be obtained. The establishment of a network of marine reserves also allows the protection of several replicate populations, increasing the chances of survival and adaptability with changing environmental conditions. It also offers a valuable way to represent habitats within a region, for example in the Channel Islands (California) case study </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">(</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Airame</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> et al., 2003) it </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">was suggested that 30-50% of each habitat found should be protected. This is a figure reached upon by many independent studies that I have investigated throughout my research. Roberts et al.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> (2003) </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">calculated that by protecting just 30%+ of habitats, 80% of the populations concerned will be effectively conserved.

There </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">is also a consensus throughout the literature for representation and replication, as many studies reach the same conclusions; all habitats should be represented and there should be from one to four (preferably 3) examples of each habitat to be protected.

Although this report will not expand on the legislative policies involved in marine reserve design some policies do mandate the involvement of all stakeholder’s throughout the design and implementation process of marine </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">reserves, as well as their future monitoring and evaluation (</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Marine and Coastal act 2009 (Marine Management Organisation, 2012)). </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The performance of the marine reserve should be evaluated regularly throughout the monitoring of the marine reserve, in order to understand any progress that is occurring as well as any amendments that are necessary. Those designing marine reserves must allow for adaptations to be made in the future if need be, therefore boundaries and regulations should be made with this in mind. The use of adaptive management will allow the marine reserve to be improved over time and will optimise its effectiveness. The monitoring of programmes should include the assessment of not only changes to the ecosystem, but also the effectiveness of management and socio-economic outcomes, such as economic impacts and public opinion. The continual monitoring of reserve effectiveness also provides tools for scientific research. The design process of all reserves should be based on scientific information and the monitoring of marine reserves will offer more scientific literature that can be used in the future. Marine reserves not only provide information for the establishment of future and more effective marine conservation, they also provide unique </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">areas that offer rare opportunities for research into the structure, function and variation of marine ecosystems. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Conclusion</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The scientific literature researched for this report consisted of many examples of marine reserve implementation, marine reserve design guidelines as well as other studies reviewing their success. However it is important to use caution when using this source of information, as many studies included issues that may hinder inference from their findings. Many reviews have criticised the lack of scientific literature relating to this area of study, however this problem was not encountered during this review. The data sets available were abundant, which can explained by the continual rise in awareness and growing perception of ocean systems by humans; however the data available had to be analysed and interpreted carefully. Many contained mistakes that heavily influenced their significance and validity, for example many studies used replications of their studies at different locations within the same reserve therefore, unknowingly, using </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">pseudoreplicates</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> for their investigations and many studies did not contain control sites. Despite this throughout the research and evidence discussed in this report it is clear to see that MPAs are clearly one of the most powerful methods available in marine conservation efforts today.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">When considering the research and evidence discussed in this report it is clear to see that the best marine protected areas i.e. those that are ecologically viable whilst providing the needs of all stakeholders, consist of a network of moderately sized reserves that are variably spaced.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> This report was approached with the strong opinion that current reserves are insufficient at dealing with the human impacts forced upon the oceans and that, most significantly, the use of small reserves (&lt;1km-&lt;10km) were completely pointless. However it is shown clearly that the implementation of marine reserve networks shows significant positive outcomes for the vast majority of times (</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Nursey</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">-Bray, 2011; </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Halpern</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">, 2003) even when extremely small or implemented with no scientific thought. However this should not promote the haphazard approach to marine reserve design as the efficacy and viability of marine reserves may be optimized by following the steps mentioned in this report and considering the variety of factors involved at each stage. This discovery is expanded on further when we consider that the outcomes of reserves are independent of size; however this is not to say that size does not matter. The significant result from small reserves is a positive outcome and is valuable knowledge to marine conservation, but when approached realistically, larger reserves result in greater absolute effects, even more effective is the use of many marine reserves. Considering the extent of human influences on marine systems, if we are to continue utilising marine resources, larger reserves are needed in greater quantities such as in the form of grand networks must be implemented. It was previously mentioned that 1.7% of the ocean is protected by marine reserves and although this percentage is low, the percentage of no take zones currently stands at only 0.01% highlighting the need for more marine protected areas </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">(IUCN, 2012).</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">In 2005 the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) set a target towards protecting at least 10% of all coastal marine systems however, as still only ~2% of our oceans are being protected, this target has been pushed back to </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">2020 (MPA news, 2010) which </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">emphasises and supports my </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">closing point. Current methods are promising; however their implementation must increase if we are to sustain viable marine populations for future generations, at the same time as utilising their resources. Although this may give the impression that the aim towards the sustainable use of our oceans is unrealistic the many reserves that have already been established show impressive results even doubling the biomass of an area (Fox et al., 2011)</span><span style="color:#c0504d; font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">and the sheer lack of reserves allows the opportunity to ensure that those implemented from now on, are designed in such a way as described in this report to optimise their efficacy. Although to insure this outcome pressure must be put on the legislative boards involved at regional, national and international levels to ensure their implementation as this a serious threat that not only leads to concerns for marine organisms but also the human population as livelihoods continue to be affected in coastal regions and food security issues grow.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">References</span><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Airame</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">, S., Dugan, E.D., Lafferty, K.D., Leslie, H., </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">McCardle</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">, D.A., &amp; Warner, R.R., 2003.    </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Applying ecological criteria to marine reserve design: A case study from the California Channel Islands, </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Ecological Applications</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">, 13: 170-184</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Agardy</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">, T., </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Sciara</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">, G.N., &amp; Christie, P., 2011.
