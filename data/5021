Members of the Panel also noted the Select Committee's intention to undertake a major report regarding Police and Crime Commissioners late in 2013, a year on from their introduction.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="color:#222222; font-family:Arial; font-size:12.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="color:#222222; font-family:Arial; font-size:12.5pt">As part of the initial Select Committee review the Panel noted that it had been stated that </span><span style="color:#222222; font-family:Arial; font-size:12.5pt; font-style:italic">"All three of the PCP chairs we heard from believed that their Panels did not have strong powers to hold a PCC to account." </span><span style="color:#222222; font-family:Arial; font-size:12.5pt">This is something that the Cumbria Police and Crime Panel also feel and as such agreed to write to the Select Committee to express their views and request that the powers and sanctions available to PCPs be reviewed. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="color:#222222; font-family:Arial; font-size:12.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="color:#222222; font-family:Arial; font-size:12.5pt">Unlike some other Panels in the country the Cumbria PCP have not yet been in a position where they have needed to hold a confirmatory hearing. Based on the experiences of other Panels and Members own understanding of the powers of PCPs in these situations however, they would like to make the following suggestion and observation:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="color:#222222; font-family:Arial; font-size:12.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="color:#222222; font-family:Arial; font-size:12.5pt">There is a lack of clarity surrounding the role of Police and Crime Panels in the appointment of </span><span style="color:#222222; font-family:Arial; font-size:15pt; font-style:italic">I </span><span style="color:#222222; font-family:Arial; font-size:12.5pt">continuation of temporary Chief Constable posts. Currently it is not clear regarding the Panels powers in to be involved in these as it is with substantive positions, for example the Temporary Chief Constable for Cumbria has been in position for almost twelve months. We would like to suggest that Panels should have a greater role in the scrutiny of these posts.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="color:#222222; font-family:Arial; font-size:12.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="color:#222222; font-family:Arial; font-size:12.5pt">In addition to the issue of confirmatory hearings the Cumbria PCP would like to raise the issue of Panels' powers in relation to dealing with complaints about Police and Crime Commissioners. As you may be aware the Cumbria PCP has dealt with a number of complaints relating to the commissioner largely in relation to one specific incident and as such has a reasonable experience of this process.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="color:#222222; font-family:Arial; font-size:12.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="color:#202020; font-family:Arial; font-size:12.5pt">The current powers are limited and do not enable the Panel to undertake any investigations into the issue beyond asking the Commissioner's Office to respond to the points raised, to see if they can be resolved and an explanation or clarification provided. The Panel then pass this information to the complainant and try to broker an informal resolution. There are no powers actually attached to this and in effect the Panel have no real powers to take any action regarding non-criminal complaints beyond raising any issues publically through the Panel meetings.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="color:#202020; font-family:Arial; font-size:12.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="color:#202020; font-family:Arial; font-size:12.5pt">Members of the Panel feel that this system can lead to false expectations from complainants who may expect that further independent investigative work could be undertaken or actions result if the complaint is perceived to be upheld by the </span><span style="color:#202020; font-family:Arial; font-size:12.5pt">Panel. As may be expected informal resolution is not always possible and yet there is very little the Panel can practically do beyond this point.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="color:#202020; font-family:Arial; font-size:12.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="color:#202020; font-family:Arial; font-size:12.5pt">The Panel would therefore request that as part of your review you explore the current powers available to Police and Crime Panels with a view to considering recommending to Government that they be extended.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="color:#202020; font-family:Arial; font-size:12.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="color:#202020; font-family:Arial; font-size:12.5pt">Should you require any additional information please do not hesitate to</span></p><p style="font-size:12.5pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="color:#202020; font-family:Arial; font-size:12.5pt">contact me.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="color:#202020; font-family:Arial; font-size:12.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="color:#202020; font-family:Arial; font-size:12.5pt">Celia Tibble</span></p><p style="font-size:12.5pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="color:#202020; font-family:Arial; font-size:12.5pt">Chair of the Cumbria Police and Crime Panel</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> </span><br /><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">December 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
