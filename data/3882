I am also aware that commissioners cannot use information that identifies people and that this restriction is preventing them from commissioning and undertaking case management for people with learning disabilities or mental health, especially where there are concerns about the quality of care provided. These issues are also preventing risk assessment, risk stratification and case reviews by multi-disciplinary teams.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">We have sought legal advice and the annex provides an overview of the advice we were given. My officials are working with NHS England on interim measures to allow commissioners to continue to work within the law and also on longer term solutions. NHS England is providing guidance as soon as the short-term solutions are agreed. We will be looking to publish guidance aimed at the wider service before the end of this financial year. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Annex - overview of legal advice on risk stratification and case management</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="color:#1f497d; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The Department has worked with NHS England and others to identify and investigate the most pressing problems relating to use of data for commissioners including risk stratification and case management.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">As indicated by Dame Fiona </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Caldicott</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> in her </span><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">report “</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Information to share or not to share: The Information Governance Review</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">”, these activities can already be carried out within the current legislative framework, and neither primary nor secondary legislation are required at the current time to enable these commissioning activities to be carried out.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Working with commissioners, we have identified interim solutions for the immediate pressure points relying upon Regulation 5 of the Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002 to provide temporary support for commissioners to access fully identifiable data.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The Department has taken leadership of this area and will be working with NHS England to ensure that long term solutions for these and other problems relating to data sharing are identified and implemented.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">For risk stratification, commissioners should use information at population level to identify those who may benefit from intervention.  It is for the GP or other direct care professional, rather than a commissioner, to make contact and access the relevant confidential patient data.
