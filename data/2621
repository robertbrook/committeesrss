Further, our casework has demonstrated the failure of the EAW regime to ensure adequate protection of the fundamental rights of those whose swift removal from one Member State to another it effects. </span></p><p style="font-size:10.5pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10.5pt">The Government has stated in its Command Paper that the EAW Framework Decision - implicitly - allows refusal of EAWs on human rights grounds, as provided for under UK law, suggesting that opting into the EAW raises no concerns from a human rights perspective. However, whilst it may be true that the EAW scheme implicitly allows refusal of an EAW on human rights grounds, this has proved to be of limited practical use: in practice, the courts apply principles elaborated by the European Court of Human Rights which impose virtually unachievable evidential and legal hurdles. FTI believes that the current approach to human rights protection needs redefining at both EU and national level so as to provide more realistic tests. As such, FTI has long called for reform of both the EAW Framework Decision and the UK Extradition Act with the objective of addressing the identified flaws.</span></p><p style="font-size:10.5pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10.5pt">We were, of course, encouraged by the Home Secretary’s announcement that the Government would</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10.5pt">, in line with our recommendations, use the 2014 opt-out decision as an opportunity to</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10.5pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10.5pt">raise the need for reform with the EU institutions and other Member States</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10.5pt">. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10.5pt">While this has not yet produced concrete commitments to reform at the EU level, we greatly welcome the steps which the Government has now taken to seek reforms to the Extradition Act 2003, particularly the proportionality assessment, the mechanisms through which premature extradition might be avoided and the amendments to the appeal process. These go a long way towards addressing our concerns and justifying the decision to opt back in to the EAW Framework Decision. Our view is that certain of the proposed amendments to the Extradition Act 2003 could go further, particularly to ensure the adequate protection of fundamental rights, and we hope that the Government will be receptive to the amendments which we hope are tabled in Parliament during the progress of the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing (‘ASBCP’) Bill. We are producing a briefing on these amendments and will happily provide the Committee with a copy in due course. We also welcome the Home Secretary’s announcement that the Government will opt in to, and seek to implement, the Framework Decision on the European Supervision Order, which FTI has consistently called for as a means of avoiding the pre-trial detention of some of those extradited under the EAW.</span></p><p style="font-size:10.5pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10.5pt">In relation to the measures falling within the Ministry of Justice’s competence to which the Government has proposed to opt back in, FTI notes that two of these have potential relevance to the operation of the EAW system:</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:10.5pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 27.83pt; padding-left:8.17pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:bold">Framework Decision 2002/514/JHA on the mutual recognition of financial penalties</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10.5pt">: </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10.5pt">In relation to the issue of proportionality, FTI has raised concerns about the use of EAWs to enforce relatively short sentences issued in respect of minor crimes, often as a result of suspended sentences being activated several years after the person’s departure from the country. FTI believes that the availability of a mechanism for ensuring the enforcement of financial penalties creates an alternative for other Member States to use in order to enforce punishment for minor crimes instead of seeking extradition in respect of a short term prison sentence.  The decision to opt in to this measure is therefore potentially helpful. However, </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10.5pt">this being </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10.5pt">a measure </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10.5pt">based on mutual recognition, </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10.5pt">participation in </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10.5pt">it </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10.5pt">raises issues relating to human rights</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10.5pt">, as discussed above</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10.5pt">.</span></li></ul><p style="font-size:10.5pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:10.5pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 27.83pt; padding-left:8.17pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:bold">Framework Decision  2008/909/JHA on the mutual recognition of custodial sentences</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10.5pt">: FTI has also drawn attention to the unnecessary human and economic cost arising from the lack of discretion available under UK law for judges to refuse the execution of a ‘conviction EAW’ in respect of a UK national or resident on condition that they serve the sentence in the UK.  The Government has announced that ‘</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10.5pt">where a UK national has been convicted and sentenced abroad, and is now the subject of a</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10.5pt">[n EAW]</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10.5pt">, we will ask, with [the issuing state’s] permission, for the warrant to be withdrawn and use the prisoner transfer arrangements instead</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10.5pt">’. Whilst FTI does not consider this to be a satisfactory approach and believes that the policy should be put on a statutory footing so as to provide effective protection to both UK nationals and residents, the availability of a mechanism for ensuring the enforcement of custodial sentences may be of assistance in ensuring those subject to conviction EAWs are not extradited needlessly to serve sentences abroad. However, this being a measure based on mutual recognition, participation in it raises issues relating to human rights, as discussed above. Further, the effective implementation of the Framework Decision more broadly will also give rise to a number of practical issues such as: the requirement for the effective consultation of prisoners, some of whom can be transferred without their consent; the need to use the measure to support the rehabilitation of prisoners; the need to take into account discrepancies regarding the likely sentence to be served in the other member state following transfer; and the need to consider the human rights in the other member state, including most notably prison conditions.</span></li></ul><p style="font-size:10.5pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10.5pt">Finally, w</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10.5pt">e also note that improvements to the EAW</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10.5pt"> scheme</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10.5pt"> are, to some extent, dependent on reforms to the EAW Framework Decision</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10.5pt">.
