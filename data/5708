font-size:12pt">This one is quite clearly to Mr Parker, originally: could you give us an overview of why businesses are set up as partnerships in the agricultural sector?</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">What types of partnerships are used and what are the implications for the sector of the clauses in the draft Finance Bill?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Michael Parker</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: By way of background, in excess of 90% of farm businesses are unincorporated.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Probably in the region of 40% trade through a partnership.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Primarily, that is through a general partnership.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">There is very little use of LLPs in our industry.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The partnership structure is a particularly suitable one for farming businesses, which tend to be family businesses, often intergenerational and with several generations included within the same partnership.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">It is quite a simple structure to operate through.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">There is less formality compared to a limited company and it probably provides greater flexibility in terms of rewarding different partners for their changing contributions to the partnership over a long career.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Also, perhaps some of the benefits of limited companies are not necessarily relevant.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">They are not necessarily looking to offer equity to external investors and there may be limited need for a limited liability.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">There are some mixed partnerships, as I think has been alluded to in earlier evidence from other people.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Often, that is for a commercial reason or an historic reason; some of these have existed for many years.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">In some cases, there are land-tenure issues as to why you would not fully incorporate a business.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">That is pretty much my overview.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> What is the effect of the draft clauses in the Finance Bill on the agricultural sector?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt;

font-size:12pt">: It is primarily the mixed-partnership legislation that could have an impact.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">It is really dependent on how the legislation is interpreted.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">We have gone from original proposals, which seemed to have a motive test that one of the main reasons for the business structure was tax avoidance, to something which is more around whether it is reasonable to assume that a tax advantage has been arrived at.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">It really depends upon how the legislation is interpreted on mixed partnerships.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Can you give examples of where you think the proposals would be damaging to agriculture?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt;

font-size:12pt">: It creates uncertainty.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">If you have a mixed partnership with a corporate partner in it, you are potentially within the legislation.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';

font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">We believe that about 60% of those 263 managers are established as LLPs, with perhaps a handful as a limited or general partnership, so this legislation is very relevant to our members.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">There are some further background details, which I will give you very briefly, because they are definitely relevant to the matters you are considering.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">These managers carry on the business of investment managers; that is, they manage investments held by funds, the shares or interests in which are marketed to investors, or else they manage institutional managed accounts for insurance companie</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">s and pension funds et cetera</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The managers do not, themselves, hold monies or assets, which is the role in the structure of prime brokers, depositaries or custodians, and the managers are not funds themselves.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">They are regulated by the FCA.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Under the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive, which is coming into force, many, if not all, of these asset managers will be classed as alternative investment fund managers, and the funds they manage as alternative investment funds—these are often referred to by the lovely acronyms AIFMs and AIFs.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">This means that the managers will be potentially subject to the regime imposed under the AIFMD on variable remuneration, which will require that receipt of a significant proportion of variable remuneration must be deferred.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">That will be between 40% and 60% of variable remuneration—in most cases, we believe it will be 60%—with at least a three-year or up to a five-year, perhaps, deferral period.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Half of all variable remuneration, whether received up front or deferred, will have to be received in the form of equity interests—in practice, equity in the fund—and that must be retained for at least six months.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The AIFMD is in the process of coming into effect but many managers are already operating similar deferment regimes for business reasons, not least because there are investor pressures.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Even if the managers are not required under the rules in the directive to operate this deferral regime, because they pass a series of proportionality tests, they may fall into other regimes under other directives or under voluntary arrangements, which will require them to operate these deferral arrangements.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The consequence is that, in these Finance Bill proposals, the parts that are of relevance to our members are those on the position of salaried members of LLPs, those which relate to the allocation of profits within partnerships with mixed membership, and, in particular, the provision that you were discussing earlier with the accountancy bodies, which relate to AIFM businesses.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">That part of the schedule is an easement—it is not a tax-raising provision at all—and is being developed with a considerable amount of input from our organisation to provide a solution to a problem that arises because of the AIFMD deferral regime.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">We are happy to talk further on that to a specific question, if you wish.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%;

font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">We had a telephone conversation as well, which was a good hour or so, and a considerable amount of email correspondence.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';

font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">It had been made in liaison meetings with HMT and HMRC, and I am afraid to say that the right channels of communication, quite clearly, had not been present.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">That was over a period of, perhaps, a year to 18 months prior to the consultative document coming out.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt;

font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">It was perhaps sealed when we described the point, which, effectively, is that, if the deferral has to be made of the whole of the remuneration—the 100% of variable—the manager who has been lucky enough to receive this amount of money has, perhaps, 20% in cash and 20% of that amount in fund equities, which he cannot redeem for six months, but he has a tax bill equal to 47% of that amount, which is due in approximately a year’s time—maybe less.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Further, if he loses remuneration, he still has the tax bill.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">When the FCA representative confirmed, more or less with the one-word answer “</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Yes</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';

font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The effort spent on this must have been a considerable part of the workload of Richard Rogers at HMRC and his team over those few months.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">In that sense, yes, we made the point and it was listened to, but I am afraid it was not one that should have been new to them, because it had been communicated clearly to them.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt;

font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">It does not enable hedge fund managers to retain cash for working capital or to indulge in any other sort of scheme.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">As I said, it is not a tax-raising measure.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The key point of the arrangement, which, I am afraid, the representative of the accountancy professions did not fully grasp, is that the tax on the variable remuneration can, if the business and the member elect to go within the scheme, because it is voluntary, be raised if the profits are deemed for tax purposes to be accruing to the business itself—the LLP—even though it is not a person for tax purposes.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The LLP then has a tax liability on that amount equal to 45%, and the LLP pays that tax.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">When the profits vest in the partner in whom they are originally intended to go to</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> in perhaps three years’ time, that partner is treated at that point as receiving the gross amount of the profits, which includes a tax credit for that 45%.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Those profits are treated as arising to him as the profits of the trade in that later year of assessment.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The amount of tax that he pays will then depend on what the tax rate is at that period.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">If we have a Government that has put it up to 50% from 45%, he suffers.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">He can also bring into account any reliefs like pension payments, gift aid or trading losses that are available.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">So, we have had a payment on account and then a realignment when the deferred profits adjust, and everybody, give or take the vagaries of life, is happy.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">If the profits have not vested, then, from a tax point of view, that is it: the amount is treated as a capital sum.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">If it is reallocated by the LLP to other partners, they get it—a share of the 55 that is left out of the 100—and there is no further tax liability, but the tax credit that was paid on it cannot be recovered.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Again, that reflects what the position is under current law: that, if a partnership, say, has retained an amount of money and not distributed it to its partners, the partners will have paid tax on that.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">If it then decides it does not need this money but will reallocate it</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> to</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> particular partners, they have no tax liability on it, because it is an amount of capital within that partnership.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">That is a very convenient and easy way of resolving the issue of how to deal with lost, unvested deferred remuneration.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">If you wanted to be more rigorous, as it were, and trace through the tax credit and see how the profits vest through into other partners who get this at second, third or fourth hand, remember the deferral periods of up to five years.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">You could have a paper trail going through various deferral rounds and taking you for 20 years, and that was not appealing to the industry or to the Revenue as an exercise.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt;

font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Hedge fund businesses have made money; therefore, the opportunity to look at using these schemes would be there.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';

font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">It will be their analysis of what abuses are out there, how widespread they are and, very importantly, what scope there is for that abuse to swell and be taken up by more and more people, if it is not checked.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';

font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">It is not a tax-raising measure; it enables managers to comply with certain requirements, or voluntary versions of those regulatory requirements, without being in a predicament that Mr Micawber would recognise.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The other parts of the legislation will be revenue-raising, or potentially revenue-raising, within our industry, because the salaried partners’ provisions will require that some businesses at least will have to look at particular partners—particular members of the LLPs—and decide whether they pass these tests.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Our suspicion is that there will be very many businesses not affected by it; in principle, it is going to affect smaller businesses less because it will be easier to show that people have a significant influence.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">If you are six partners, even if one is ever so junior, it is possible to say he has a significant influence.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The other provisions on reallocation of profits—and that is part of the chapter that has other strains in it, which, I think, are not likely to be relevant—are directed at particular schemes.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">To the extent that those schemes have been used within our industry or any other industry, if those provisions are effective they will have the consequence of producing a tax take from those firms that would otherwise use them, which is more consistent with what it should be.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt;

font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Hale</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: One of the problems with the consultation procedure, which follows a fairly rigid process, is that, in fact, it was undertaken, rightfully, conscientiously by HMRC.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">They started going out and talking to interested bodies about these proposals very early, which was the correct thing to do, because they are complicated and significant and they affect a large part of the economy.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">As a result of that and the comments they were getting, HMRC and HMT realised that various parts of those proposals would need to be changed.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">For instance, on the salaried partners’ provisions, originally there was a two-tier test—a sort of filter, if you like.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The first filter was: is this partner, under ordinary law, an employee of the LLP?</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">We were not involved in the discussions on that, so this is hearsay, but a number of members of our organisation who were have contacted us, so it is not bad hearsay.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The message that came through to the Government very quickly on that was that that test does not get anywhere, because it is not going to filter out more than, say, 1% of the partners the Government was interested in, because the tests of employment are really not very appropriate to deciding whether someone is a partner or not.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">So you were left with the second tier of tests.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">That tier of tests, as framed in the consultative document, was widely seen as impractical, and it was in response to that that the Revenue went away and reformulated the current three conditions we have.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Those conditions may or may not be useful but they were being formulated, and there was a good deal of input from a good number of interested parties.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">It may be that the Revenue was talking mainly to people in the City and to City-based institutions, like the Chartered Institute of Taxation and so on, and was not talking more widely around the country, but it really was </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">the</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> case that, by the time we put in our response to the consultation, which closed on about 8 or 9 August, we were really replying to a consultation on a series of proposals that had been altered in quite a lot of important respects.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">You may regard that as an effective consultation, because the Revenue were hearing things, listing things and acting on them.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">In some ways, it is also a waste of time because a lot of points were being made at the expense of a good deal of paper and a good deal of effort on parts of respondents that had already been addressed and were no longer part of the proposal.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt;

font-size:12pt">: To add a comparative point, the UK Government’s consultation procedure is incredibly open and is much more thorough than what we experience in other jurisdictions.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">We see that there is willingness to engage and willingness to listen, even though</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">, in the end, we may not be happy with the results because there may be political decisions taken and policy will go left rather than right.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">In that respect, we would definitely commend the engagement.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">In particular, for the first time, we have seen the FCA, HMRC and HMT working closely together on something that is quite complex, and that is the interaction between the regulatory rules coming from Brussels, where the FCA may not have full scope of flexibility in terms of how they interpret the rules and how they can work with the industry, and the tax authorities, to produce something that, at least, is not extremely harmful; to produce something that, as Paul said, is an easement and makes the regime practicable for our members.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lord Joffe:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> That is a comforting response, but what is your view of the assessments made by the Government of the impact of the proposed tax changes on business in your sector?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt;

font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The fact is that we are facing enormous changes, and not just within our sector; the entire financial market is b</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';

font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">In that respect, there was a big complaint about the overall business climate that some of these profound changes are going to effect.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Hale</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';

font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Then, 30 seconds after, it produces this consultation document on partnerships that has a tremendous disruptive effect on the industry.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';

font-size:12pt"> I wonder if we could ask the same questions of Mr Parker, as to the consultative arrangements and agriculture.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Michael Parker</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: The consultation was very open. We, as an industry group, managed to get a meeting with HMRC.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">We were able to give some views, and make the point that just because a partnership is a mixed partnership does not mean that there is a tax advantage. For example, a mixed partnership does not have an annual investment allowance on plant and machinery, which could be an issue for some farming businesses.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">We were also able to give examples of where mixed partnerships that are commercially driven historically came into being and the land tenure points.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">I agree, really, that whether those points went any further than being listened to is another matter.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">It seems as though there had been a decision in terms of how the policy was going to be implemented and how the legislation would be formed, and it was just a question of evaluating whether there are unforeseen consequences, as there may be in industries such as ours.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q65 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;

font-size:12pt"> I wonder if I could ask one final question.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Do you think the Government does enough to monitor and evaluate whether the tax changes it has introduced meet their policy objectives, and if not, what more should they do?</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Hale</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: There are, perhaps, two different types of tax change here that need to be considered.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The first, which is really what we have been talking about today, is anti-avoidance measures.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Those are effectively monitored, because HMRC has identified an abuse and told the Government it needs to be dealt with.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Having introduced the legislation</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> they will continue to monitor tax returns, disclosures of tax schemes et cetera to try and determine whether it has been effective or not, so in that sense that monitoring is continuous.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Some form of public report to say, “Yes this has been successful; hey, look, we think we have saved </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">£</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">X billion from being lost” may or may not be necessary.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The other sort of tax change out there is a measure that would be designed to influence behaviour, or encourage investment, or something like that.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">There is a much stronger case for having a more formal system for reviewing that.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Presumably, the Treasury does internally wish to know whether a measure that has been promoted has been successful.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Presumably, where it has been promoted at the behest of an interested body, they will be monitoring it.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">So, if you have some sort of relief for building wind farms or producing films in the UK, interest groups will be getting input from their members as to whether it is working or not.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Now, there is always going to be a time lag in finding out how effective something like that is, because tax returns come in, say, a year after the profits have been earned against which the relief is being claimed, and then they are considered.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">You are always going to have a timescale of two or three years before the results are known.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">However, presumably, if a measure has been introduced for a policy reason like that, then there should be a mechanism of evaluating whether it has been successful.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">It would be interesting for the general public to know whether the relief has been put to good use or not.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';

font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Baroness Drake:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> I will try to make this very brief.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Mr Hale, of the three economic tests—variable profits, influence over management and capital contribution—which will pose the greatest challenge to your members?</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Hale</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: To go in reverse order, as it were, the capital test is very likely to be of absolutely no help.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Hedge fund management businesses, because they do not hold client money, and as I said at the beginning, because they are not trading their own assets, have a very low regulatory capital requirement.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">It may be something like 13 weeks’ expenses.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">If things go well in a hedge fund, the financial rewards are very great and the variable remuneration therefore could well be expected to be more than four times the amount of capital that the individual has put in.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The variable remuneration, in some businesses, would be an issue.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">It is not quite clear how that is defined and operated in practice. There is, as drafted, a definite link to the overall profits of the business.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">In a lot of businesses, you will have people who are remunerated, to some extent, by the results of their own income stream.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The accountancy bodies touched on that earlier.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">However, you could well have a situation in a fund management business where you have, perhaps, three funds and three separate teams that are largely responsible for each fund.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Their remuneration will be tailored to those particular funds’ performance, rather than to the performance of the business as a whole.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Now, you may be able to come up with an arrangement in your partnership agreement that says your remuneration will be assessed by looking at the profits of the business as a whole, and deciding what proportion of that profit you will get in terms of performance units.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Performance units will be geared to what you have done in your own part of the business.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Is that getting close enough to the parties being affected substantially by the whole profits of the business or not?</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">I do not know.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The draft guidance the Revenue has published is not particularly helpful on that point.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Then, finally, there is significant influence.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">It is clear that significant influence does not mean the abi</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">lity to control the business; it means the ability to make your voice heard and have your opinions taken into account.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The Revenue suggest in their guidance that if you have a management board of 10 they would regard, in principle, all of those 10 as having significant influence.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">If you have more than 10 on the board, some of those people would not have significant influence.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">That characteristic is going to be one that will help clarify the position of a lot of members in hedge fund management businesses, because—and again, I do not have the figures on this—my experience is that a lot of the businesses are 10 partners or less.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">However, there will be some businesses where you have a large number of partners and/or distinct income or profit streams within the business, where there will be more of an issue.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';
