With this in mind I sought to stay at this level but to differentiate between crime and antisocial behaviour, which is an area often raised by my local residents. By my focusing upon all crime types the Constabulary is encouraged to see all crimes as equally important and generally no crime should be competing for priority. Of course there are occasions when it is in the public interest for a matter to be prioritised.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="color:#111111; font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="color:#111111; font-family:Arial; font-size:11.5pt">Crime classification responsibility rests with frontline officers.
