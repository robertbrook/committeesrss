font-size:11pt">6  The Scottish Government asked the LRRG to identify how more people in rural and urban Scotland can have a stake in the ownership, governance, management and use of land, leading to a greater diversity of land ownership, and ownership types, in Scotland.  HIE shares the premise of the LRRG that more diversified land ownership, specifically community land ownership, can create greater opportunities for sustainable economic growth.  </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Moreover, when considering the Highlands and Islands region and the dual remit of our agency - enabling economic and community development - it can be shown that where communities own and manage their own land the powerful outcomes secured extend beyond solely economic advantage.  Where communities direct their own development, primarily enabled by income sources and opportunities derived from their land holding outcomes include increased community capacity, confidence and high levels of autonomy.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">7  Land is a fundamental yet finite resource.  We believe a diversified land ownership pattern, enabling communities as land owners, is highly compatible with a sustainable and more equitable modern Scottish economy.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">8  Whilst HIE is committed to enabling increased community and wider social/economic benefit from Scotland’s land resource through community ownership, we believe that land reform extends beyond the Land Reform (Scotland) Act (LRA) and community ownership.  As detailed in our evidence to the LRRG, although the Community Right to Buy and </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Crofting</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> Community Right to Buy legislation is welcome the total amount of land passed into community ownership through the LRA provisions is nominal.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:11pt">9  Furthermore, the LRA applies only to rural areas and can only be utilised by community bodies and </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">crofting</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> community bodies (geographically-based, open membership community companies).  At present, therefore, the LRA does not support individuals, public bodies, NGOs or community bodies </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">outwith</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> rural Scotland to acquire land.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">10  We concluded the LRA is having a limited impact on both the diversity of land ownership and even less impact on diversity of land ownership types.  We would therefore welcome the consideration of other measures, which together with the LRA, would help more people to benefit directly from the opportunities afforded by land ownership in Scotland.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">11  We would note that, critical to the enabling role which we have delivered supporting communities across Scotland to acquire their own assets are both our broad expertise in the complex community ownership sector and the responsive flexibility in our support over time. Recognising that the journey to acquire assets by communities is invariably a lengthy one, longevity of relationships between communities and HIE staff is also an intrinsic enabling-success factor.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Land ownership concentration underpinned by public, especially fiscal, policy</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">12  HIE supports communities, social enterprises and businesses to realise their development and growth aspirations.  This is enabled through the framework of a long term relationship with individual organisations, and allows us to provide access to a range of business and community development products and services, specialist advice and capital investment in the form of grants and loans.  Support to acquire land and assets is centred on our work to strengthen communities - community-led regeneration with the direct outcome of increasing the resilience of whole communities.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">13  Access to land for development and regeneration purposes can be a barrier to sustainable development.  This can take the form of lack of available land to acquire or lease (market failure) or the cost to acquire/lease land that is available; these two factors being closely related.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">14  With respect to the purchase of large tracts of rural land (forestry, estates, islands) it is our experience that the contemporary value of such land is disproportionate to the return on investment that such assets typically generate.  This could be shown as a direct legacy of the economic context and fiscal environment of land ownership over time in Scotland and a legacy which presents a barrier to diversified land ownership patterns in Scotland today.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">15  The effect of the historic context is it necessitates that purchasers of larger land assets must have access to significant financial resources. Community bodies are often not in this position, and as they cannot usually borrow against the asset (due to low return on investment levels noted above) they have been typically dependent on significant support from the public purse to achieve community ownership of assets.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">16  The 432:50 reports cites examples of certain tax reliefs and offsetting that land ownership can provide.  If a change in fiscal arrangements regarding landownership is to be considered, we would welcome measures that are transparent and encourage investment which deliver a range of economic, social and environmental benefits.  Tax incentives or relief that support wider rural development objectives, and increase the resilience of rural communities would be beneficial to our region and to Scotland, in our view. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">17  Overall, it is important that any new fiscal proposals encourage, and do not inhibit, investment in land.  Land-related tax arrangements that drive wider public benefit outcomes will increasingly enable greater parity of economic and social benefit for all, from Scotland’s valuable land resource.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">18  Regarding land management grants, it is perhaps not surprising that larger landholdings tend to accrue, in total, greater public subsidy in the form of forestry grants, land management options and nature conservation grants as these tend to be disbursed on a ‘per hectare’ basis.  Greater diversity in ownership could enable production/conservation support to be more equitably distributed amongst a greater number of owners.  We do however recognise that smaller landholdings and those on less productive land have found it more challenging to access such support schemes.  We would be encouraged if the forthcoming SRDP (Scottish Rural Development Programme) included measures to support smaller landholding enterprises and also those on poorer quality land.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:11pt">19  We would welcome consideration of fiscal and public policy measures that will create an environment for increasing the economic and community benefits from Scotland’s land resource – specifically diversified ownership, and an environment where community ownership is enabled.  We would also welcome land management/conservation support (subsidy) that favours smaller landholdings and encourages purposeful use of less productive land.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:11pt">25  Supporting communities to own and manage land often requires significant capital investment, and this is particularly so in urban areas where land and asset values are higher than in a rural context.  As discussed previously, commercial borrowing is rarely available to communities, or not to an extent that will enable the purchase to proceed on the basis of loan finance only.  Coupled to this is that most communities, at the time of purchase, have little if any trading history and very limited cash reserves.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:11pt">26  Adding important context to the note above, communities do not enter into asset acquisition naively - as might be implied by the absence of trading history or financial capability.  HIE support for communities, established sometimes around the contemporary availability of an asset but also as part of the long term relationship, enables the building of capacity within community "anchor" organisations; these being the organisations which go on to acquire assets and contribute to whole community resilience. Longevity of support from HIE is assured beyond the acquisition phase, with community organisation growth and development being supported - as we value highly the critical role community organisations play in ensuring a strong, diverse economy and confident society in the Highlands and Islands region.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;
