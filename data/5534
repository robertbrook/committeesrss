Andrew, I wonder whether you could tell us a little bit about your organisation and the experience you have had to date with trying to obtain state aid, which I understand has not gone quite as smoothly as you might have hoped.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Andrew Leaver</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Our group is attempting to purchase a parcel of land or forest that the Forestry Commission deemed surplus. We started that process five years ago. At that point in time there was no Scottish Land Fund, but we were encouraged to attempt to do something on the basis that legislation and policy may change.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">About two years ago—I lose track of time—we had been trying different activities. The Scottish Land Fund was </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">relaunched</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, and we had a meeting with a member of staff from Highlands and Islands Enterprise, which was very encouraging. I cannot hold the guy to it—it is not his fault—but he suggested that we could get a large sum of money, in the region of potentially £500,000, which was a big sum in the £700,000 purchase price, and that we should make an application. It was very good.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q139 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Which organisation gave you that impression?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Andrew Leaver</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: A guy from Highlands and Islands Enterprise. Unfortunately what then happened, and I do not know how, is that about two weeks later or shortly afterwards—this is about two years ago now—we were informed by Highlands and Islands Enterprise that there could be some issues or problems with the allocation of funds from the Scottish Land Fund for the purchase of forestry by community groups. This related to application of the European Union state aid regulations. When we went in for a meeting it was made clear to us that the state aid regulations were being applied such that the maximum grant could be 20% of the value of the forest, or €200,000, whatever that equivalent may be.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">At that time we were attempting to buy a £700,000 forest, and the grant that we might have been able to obtain was nowhere near enough to get us toward that £700,000 figure. In the last two years, we have had to spend more time identifying other potential ways of taking control of the forest. The biggest problem was the sudden—to us—apparent application of state aid regulations to the Scottish Land Fund.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q140 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir James </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Paice</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Thank you very much for that, Mr Leaver. Can we be clear to start with? The £700,000 is the full open market valuation.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Andrew Leaver</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes. It is a valuation undertaken by the district </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">valuer</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q141 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir James </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Paice</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> There was no question of a discount on the price; this was purely to enable you to fund the purchase at market price.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Andrew Leaver</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It was actually £690,000, to be fair. It was provided by the district valuation service in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Inverness</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> as the full market value.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q142 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir James </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Paice</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I thought that was the case. I just wanted to get that clear, because there has been some confusion. When Highlands and Islands Enterprise later produced this European rule of 20% or €200,000, apart from the inevitable heart attack, shock and all that side of it, what did you do? Did you seek further clarification on that, or did you go for any other interpretation of the rules?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Andrew Leaver</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We do not have the right to appeal. There is nowhere we can go for alternative interpretation. I did write to the person here next to me, Rachael McCormack, asking for further information or some explanation. I probably wrote a letter saying, “I can’t believe this. It is an unbelievable occurrence.” Being a community member, you do that. I got a very bald answer just saying, “These are the rules; live with them.” At least that was my interpretation of the letter. We have no other recourse.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What was more promising perhaps—I lose track of time but it was probably summer 2011, so maybe 18 months ago—was that there was talk of trying to get some kind of block exemption for forestry. Different Highlands and Islands Enterprise staff talked about ideas that they were </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">having and approaches they would make to try and improve things. There were some very good conversations, but that has led nowhere over this period. We have seen no progress in trying to overcome this interpretation of the state aid rules.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q143 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir James </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Paice</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Tell us about your plans for the forestry. Were you going to operate it in any commercial way? Would there be any form of trading involved? What were your plans?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Andrew Leaver</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There is a story too. When we launched our campaign—let’s call it—our attempt to buy the forest in 2009 we were supported by Highlands and Islands Enterprise. We were told that we needed to be a social enterprise; we needed to be an organisation that was run by the community, which was commercially viable and which would generate income that could be reinvested in the community. We put together a business plan that was about making money and reinvestment. Of course that made us commercial, and therefore you have to apply the state aid regulations. That was a problem for us.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In one of the conversations we had with HIE, it was actually suggested to us that if communities were aiming to buy the land for social and environmental reasons and not economic ones, maybe they would not have to apply the state aid rules—maybe. But that was a complete reversal of the advice we had received three years previously, which was to be a social enterprise and to make money. We were getting contradictory information. I have to say that that one conversation never went anywhere, so I don’t think much of it. To us as a community group, it was a sign of the confusion that was going on within Highlands and Islands Enterprise at that time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q144 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir James </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Paice</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Just for clarity, before moving on to the wider issue, I asked you the question about open market value, but if you had been able to persuade the Forestry Commission to sell it to you for less than market value, that too would have fallen foul of state aid, or didn’t this arise?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Andrew Leaver</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: That did not arise. My understanding of the Forestry Commission is another issue, but the phrase they used was “protecting the taxpayers’ interest” and “getting best value for the taxpayer”, which is about the open market value. I have a whole rake of things to say about how the open market value is come to, but we will save that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q145 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir James </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Paice</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I am about to open that up for you, because my next question is from your evidence. You say that if the public benefits that could come from community ownership were incorporated in the process, the market value might be lower. I think that is what you are suggesting. Basically that is an open question to answer as you wish.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Andrew Leaver</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There are two things. On the open market value for forestry, I have evidence, should I want to read it out, from the DV, who clearly states in our valuation, and in valuations for other forests which I have received, that the value placed on forestry does not relate to the economic returns that can be gained from harvesting the woodland. It is about the value that is placed on it because of the tax benefits to a private owner, and also sometimes—not with our particular forest but in other areas of the highlands—because of the personal satisfaction and kudos of owning a piece of land on the west coast of Scotland. This adds a much inflated market value. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Community groups do not have the same interest in owning a piece of land for vanity reasons, and certainly do not have the same tax benefits in terms of inheritance and capital gains tax. The inflated value that the market puts on it is a problem for us. It is created by the tax regime that surrounds forestry.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Going back to your point about a reduced price from the Forestry Commission, it is something we would be very interested in talking to them about, but their interpretation of protecting the taxpayers’ interest and in the public interest purely comes down to how much money they can take back into the coffers. They interpret the Treasury rules such that there has to be a financial benefit—a financial value. Although we are talking about providing social and environmental benefits, they do not come into any calculation in relation to the public interest by the Forestry Commission when they are looking at the value of the land. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q146 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I do not know if you are familiar with it, but that is a bit like the Crown Estate’s response to these sorts of issues. I see all the members of the panel nodding, but unfortunately that does not get recorded, therefore you have to say something.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Andrew Leaver</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I am aware of the Crown Estate’s response, but not in detail.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q147 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir James </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Paice</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> With your permission Chairman, I would like to take in some of the other witnesses. I would like to turn to Rachael. On this issue, sticking to forestry before we move to wider issues, what made HIE change its position? Was it new rules, new interpretation of rules or individual misunderstanding of rules? What happened?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rachael McCormack</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: When the Scottish Land Fund was launched in 2012, we identified a possible maximum intervention rate of 95%, together with colleagues in the Big Lottery and the Scottish Government. When we are talking with communities, whether it is around a Scottish Land Fund application that might be coming forward or an application in relation to any other fund—indeed an application to HIE for support—we would be at pains not to stifle their ambition. It would not be for HIE at an early stage of the conversation to be talking to a community group about whether or not they ought to aspire to a maximum intervention rate. We were also not sighted in those early parts of the conversation on some of the detail, which we would need to start to look at when we had a clear idea about the nature of the proposal coming forward. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">As all of the Committee will be aware, forestry is a primary activity under the legislation. As such, the state aid rules that apply are pretty clear and pretty well set out. Having said that, those rules apply to commercial forestry. If an application were to come forward from a community organisation with an emphasis, for instance, on amenity, on education or on biodiversity and nature conservation, there are other potential routes that we can consider. Rather than preclude the community from being innovative and looking at what it needs and wants to put forward to a funder, HIE works with community organisations across the region supporting applications to a range of different sources of funding. It is not for us to direct the community in terms of its areas of focus. Therefore we would not say “go for this intervention rate or that intervention rate,” other than to say that there is a maximum intervention rate available and it is ultimately predicated on exactly what constitutes not just the parcel of land or assets that you would like to bring forward but the nature of the activity that you intend to take forward on that asset.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q148 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir James </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Paice</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You said just now that there may be other ways forward.

It is that commercial issue that presents the challenge. When we are clear on that, we then interpret the legislation. It is there to be interpreted, and I have said on a number of occasions in arenas not dissimilar to this one that the regulation is there and we work jolly hard to navigate a path through that supports the level of ambition within our communities. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">A similar example in terms of a large-scale commercial forestry application that came forward to HIE, initially in anticipation of a 95% intervention rate from the Scottish Land Fund, was the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Colintraive</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Glendaruel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> community group looking at over 600 acres of land that they were looking to acquire with a view to a degree of commercial activity, but actually the primary focus for the community organisation was around social benefit. It was around potential woodland crofts and housing and places for local employment, perhaps looking at low-carbon, locally supplied wood fuel; but in order to be able to resource that, there was a commercial component that they needed to extract from the asset. In discussion with ourselves and my expert staff in our community assets team, they approached a private developer with a view to a deal that was brokered with the private developer who took rights to the timber, and the intervention rate from the public purse on a £1.55 million asset acquisition was very low indeed.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">From my point of view—perhaps this is a particular opinion—that demonstrates the innovation that can be brought about when we look outside the box and think about best use of public moneys, how we can bring innovation and new opportunities and actually challenge the basis on which we come forward to the public purse from an </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">additionality</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> point of view.

It is not just for, in your case, the forestry example that you represent, but for the wider issues as well. I appreciate that we have now been joined by Mr Dutton from DTAS and Mr Ritch from the Lottery—he introduced himself earlier. Perhaps others would want to answer this, but the first point has to be, from information we have already had, has there been any change in the actual regulations on state aid over the last decade or so? Is anybody aware of that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Neil Ritch</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: This is my second Land Fund, as it were. When operating Land Fund and Lottery schemes, and investing assets as well, we have sought to navigate that territory. While the fundamental regulation has not changed, what does change a little is the interpretation of that regulation. That is the business that we are in as grant-makers, and I would say that is the situation Rachael was describing. You need a certain amount of information about a project in order to try to reach a judgment. It is a really difficult balance to strike, between, “This is really exciting and you should do it” and “There will be some bumps in the road and there may be state aid or other regulatory challenges.” </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What we have sought to do in every case we have dealt with is support the community to work as effectively as they can to put together the best funding package they can within whatever regulatory framework affects it.

In relation to state aid, we look to structure project funding as effectively as we can to work within the rules as we understand them, based on the advice we have, to support those communities as best we can.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q156 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir James </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Paice</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Where has this reinterpretation come from that you imply has taken place?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Neil Ritch</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I do not think I would go as far as to say it is a reinterpretation.

We have sought to act as effectively as we can within the advice we have. To that extent, we have always been aware of the basic state aid tests, and we apply them to the cases that we need to fund. We then need to react to what the answers to those questions tell us. Sometimes the judgments you make in relation to those questions are different because case law emerges in relation to state aid. It is not always a precise area. It is not a piece of regulation that is well designed for the kind of business we are in, in terms of supporting communities to buy land, so it does become pretty challenging to try and walk a very straight line on it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir James </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Paice</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">: </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">Mr Dutton wants to come in.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q159 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Mr Dutton, since this is the first time you will have spoken, perhaps you could introduce yourself.

My role as a development officer for the north of Scotland is quite often answering queries such as these from members. The general point I would make in connection with that is that I would not say there has been a change. I have in a previous incarnation been involved in the public sector. In the last few years, a lot more agencies, public sector organisations and local authorities have become aware of the state aid rules, whereas before they perhaps were not, or they thought it was not really relevant to them. They become aware of it at the time, and there is not the knowledge within their organisations about what the state aid rules are, certainly at an operating level. They will tend to be pretty risk averse—whether it is a local authority, an agency or whoever—and there are very few points of reference or people they can go and speak to in order to get an opinion on that. The Scottish Government’s own state aid unit has traditionally also been quite conservative and risk averse in its interpretation. Even if agency or local authority staff went somewhere else to get opinions, they have all tended to be quite risk averse in their interpretation. Another point is that a lot of the staff do not have the time to do a detailed state aid analysis of each and every application that comes forward. That is partly against the backdrop of not knowing the ins and outs of it. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We have two contracts from the Scottish Government, one of which is to do with asset transfer—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q160 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Just to be clear, when you said that staff did not have the time and so on, I am not quite clear whose staff you are referring to.

It is run through contractors. They have deemed all assistance granted through that to be state aid, because that saves them having to spend time analysing whether each case constitutes state aid or not, and whether it needs to be taken into account by the rules or whether it falls </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">outwith</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> the rules.

Going to the promotional event for that, the point we picked up on was that everything was going to be treated as state aid. There were some groups within the presentation there who were talking about enterprises where there was no local market, far less any involvement of international trading, yet any assistance forthcoming was going to be deemed state aid and subject to the rules.

As cases are tested and found by the Commission, it is that case law which forms a platform going forward in terms of the contemporary interpretation. As with any significant legislation, there are reference points along the way, as a treaty is interpreted over time and as contemporary interpretation is made by the Commission.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What we are aware of is the programme of reform that the Commission has under way from 2012, and information circulated as recently as last spring that is looking at the ways in which the state aid legislation can be more readily interpreted, more readily supportive of a growth agenda and more readily strengthening local economic markets. We welcome the reform and the trajectory of that.

As a principle, we try to maximise the no aid argument because we are very conscious that, for example, de </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">minimis</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> levels are very precious to communities.

What we are increasingly involved in is the idea of transfer from the public sector and from local authorities, which hold quite a lot of assets, not all of which are being fully utilised for their primary purposes. In our role, we have not tended to get too involved in forestry or agriculture-type cases, but we do a lot of work with groups who are taking on assets from the public sector. When you are getting an asset for less than what is called best consideration, because of the wider benefits—which local authorities certainly can do—that is deemed to be assistance, because it is a discount on the value, and therefore that can be considered against the backdrop of state aid. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">On your first point, yes, the main funding if you want to acquire assets such as estates, forestry, etc., would be the sort of things we were discussing before, but there are other options for smaller assets.

If they are lucky, if they are in the highlands and islands maybe, and they have some resources for a development officer, that helps a lot. If they are lucky and get through phase one of a Lottery or Land Fund-type application and they get funding for development, then that helps a lot. But generally speaking, you are talking about people in their spare time, and they do need to seek professional advice on the legal and the property side, with surveyors, valuations and all these sorts of things. There is a lack of places they can go for little bits of funding to investigate the feasibility of something, to investigate its condition or its market value.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q180 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I understand the difficulties about ordinary community representatives learning the language that bureaucracies utilise.

As far as the broad principles of the state aids debate are concerned, we took time last year to produce our own guide to state aids, so that hopefully if any groups were looking to take on an asset, they could have their own opinion as to what they think it may or may not be and therefore be in a better negotiating position. We are not a legal authority on it by any means, but we can explain the basics of the European regulation and give groups a better basis to negotiate or discuss with a potential donor or transferor of the asset, or with a grant-awarding body or something like that. Giving organisations a bit of knowledge and confidence in their own knowledge of the topic does not necessarily mean that they can make progress in the negotiations.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q181 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Why can they not make progress?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rory Dutton</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I probably came in a bit heavy-handed right at the beginning, when I had just joined you.

I can think of an example where the community was told, “It is against state aid rules.” They were only talking about local competition in a village about their café. It was not anything to do with international trade whatsoever. It is even debatable whether there was any competition, or whether the market would be big enough easily to have two or three cafés anyway, but the local authority in question said, “No, that is against the state rules and you cannot have a community café.”</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q193 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Reid:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Was there not a de </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">minimis</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> of €200,000 where the state aid rules did not apply.

Their understanding as presented to me, and my understanding from Wikipedia, is that EU state aids require distortion of the international market and require something that will affect international trade. You could argue that by introducing a new player to the forestry market there would be a problem, but here we are talking about community forests, who are harvesting purely to reinvest income into their own activity. Even at </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Aigas</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> forest, which is 700 acres, we are lucky if we are producing £120,000 worth of timber. Most of that income is then spent on restocking and re-fencing. The amount of money and trade in the European timber market as affected by a community-owned forest is just a drop in the ocean. We just don’t even touch it. That is why we don’t understand why you would apply state aid rules if it is meant to affect trade between member states and to distort the market.

The big investment area that we operate as the Big Lottery Fund is Growing Community Assets, which is about transferring assets over to communities. We do have to take state aid into account there as well. Where we run into most problems, and we have to do quite a bit of negotiation in some cases, is where there is purely local competition. If there is a community café being set up, we need to make sure that any other competitors in that area are quite happy with that. Rather than state aid, these are the sort of problems we run up against more often.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Another UK programme we operated was Village SOS, which was all about trying to boost social enterprise in rural communities throughout the UK.

The state aid complaint process is a really useful step if you want to create that dispute. The question of interference with international markets is a problematic judgment. The guidance from Government states that it is quite a low bar and that you must take cognisance of the potential to impact international markets in making your judgment. You find yourself in that rather strange position of asking yourself, “Will a forest of the scale of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Aigas</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> really queer the market?” That is the bar at which you need to make the judgment.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Andrew Leaver</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I live in a rural community, and we can understand displacement and local competition. I understand that. If you have a thriving business and HIE were to give a grant to a second thriving business and the first one goes out of business and people lose employment, I can understand arguments against that and why HIE would have to consider that.

There is no way that concerns international and there is no way that should be state aid.” They are clearly prepared to take the risk that is seen by the awarding agency.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There is a fair point that the gentleman on the end made about the risk to others if the thing is closed down. That is worth bearing in mind. I would say that most communities who have a big issue with a state aid decision are pretty confident that it is not an issue, and they would be taking a risk.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Going back a wee bit to the responsibilities, I may be wrong but I seem to remember that there is an onus on the people giving financial assistance to let the community know it is being done through de </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">minimis</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, so that they know to add it to their rolling total.

It was either Andrew or Rory who said earlier that there are tax benefits to a private owner that do not apply to a community group. When working out whether state aid applies, is the awarding body allowed to take into account the fact that the community group is not getting the state aid of tax benefits and subtract that from the state aid that you do get? Is that a possible route?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Andrew Leaver</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I will make a comment although, to be fair, somebody else needs to answer the question. One thing that struck me on that tax benefit thing is that the reason that forestry prices are inflated, apart from the value of tax benefits to private owners in particular, but even to commercial owners, what we found that it is also a different interpretation—I’m looking for the words. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What we are also confused about is where there is transfer of ownership of a forest. The amount of timber you take out will not be altered by the transfer of ownership. It will grow at the rate it grows, and it will be harvested when it is due to be harvested. The value of the market at the time will pay that value. The transfer of ownership itself will not affect the amount of timber extracted or the value of that timber, which is where it hits the market—the extractive market. There is a double issue. One is, do they take into account the fact that we do not have the same tax benefits and therefore we are paying over what we would pay? Also, because the timber does not change in value just because the ownership is transferred, why again is that affecting the market?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q218 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> There are two issues there.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Andrew Leaver</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There are, I’m afraid.

That is certainly something that we will explore further. On the point about forestry, I had thought, maybe mistakenly, that much of the thrust behind community ownership was to utilise potential assets which were not presently being harvested, marketed or developed and so on. Therefore there was the creation of economic activity rather than just simply a transfer of ownership from one to the other. Presumably if it is a transfer of ownership from the public sector to a community group, then that, if it is viable, could be funded commercially and need not require funding from HIE or the lottery or anybody else.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Andrew Leaver</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Aigas</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is slightly different from some other forestry groups, but the principle is the same. The trees were planted 50 years ago and they are near maturity. Somebody will need to harvest them, whether it is the Forestry Commission or whoever. They have deemed the land surplus so the Forestry Commission are unlikely to be the harvesting body. If we do not buy it, they will sell it on the private market. The private owner, whether it is a commercial forestry or a private owner, will need to harvest those trees. You cannot leave them; they will fall down. Somebody will harvest those trees, whether it is us or somebody else.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The transfer of ownership itself will not affect the value of the timber that is taken out. All it is doing by giving us the grant to purchase it is providing the community with the opportunity to make some money out of that forest instead of a private owner. Somebody is going to make the same amount of money. It is going to hit the market at roughly the same time and give roughly the same value of timber, regardless of the owner. Again that goes back to why apply state aid to that particular transaction.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think I understand why.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q219 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Reid:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Could we have a comment from the Lottery?

Various different assistances are available to private owners that would form state aid, like feed-in tariffs, renewable obligation certificates, forestry grants and farming subsidies. Are all of these things ever looked at in the calculation of whether it is possible to move across to community ownership rather than a private ownership when you are considering the applications?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Neil Ritch</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: A range of those benefits are available to community owners too. If you take assistance to renewable energy projects, for example, we have had situations where communities have been funded, and they chose then to change their funding arrangements from a grant from us to feed-in tariffs, because that offered them a better long-term income stream. It depends on the project and the organisation and what they are trying to do.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q226 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mike </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Crockart</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> But you can understand where the question is coming from. We are looking at why state aid is a barrier, or seems to be a barrier, for communities to buy up land when, at the same time, the private landowner is already able to access funds that are effectively state aid.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rachael McCormack</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: May I contextualise? Since 1997, HIE has supported 167 community asset acquisitions, and over 311,000 acres of land is in the ownership of communities during that same period.  I want to put those numbers on the table as balancing statistics. The barrier is the extent to which the land or asset has the potential to affect international trade. When we are talking about commercial forestry in isolation, as opposed to any other sort of land acquisition, it is very specifically prescribed within the treaty. There are very clear guidelines in terms of what can and cannot be done.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Our starting point in any state aid discussion is to maximise a no aid position. There are a number of examples, and I am happy to give the Committee a specific example which might illustrate the rationale of an individual bespoke approach to the assessment. An activity supporting development of industrial units for local employment, which if we were to do it in Oban or in Inverness would demonstrably create displacement, would have an impact and would not be eligible for aid. We have supported a community in West Harris to the tune of £154,000, based on a no aid argument that looks at the history of land ownership, the availability of land and the activity within the market. We have taken advice from property specialists, and made a strong and robust no aid argument to support that community to drive forward its ambition. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q227 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I’m sorry; I don’t quite understand the wording.

I would like to ask Rory first of all because it generates from the evidence that you submitted, which really dealt with the community right to buy. It only allows communities in Scotland with a population of 10,000 to apply to register an interest in land—effectively rural areas. For example, in the constituency that I represent, the vast majority of it would not fall within the map; I have had a look at the map. Yet there are issues involved in urban areas where community right to buy might provide quite a good solution. Why was community right to buy limited to rural areas, and what impact do you think it would have if it was made universal?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rory Dutton</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Obviously, I cannot speak as to why it was limited to rural in the first place. Certainly, we do a lot with urban, as well as with rural. To have a universal community right to buy—whether it is rural or urban, public or private land—whatever the community size, would make a lot of sense. I am not talking about vast tracts of land, but there are a lot of key small bits of land, perhaps a building or whatever, which would make a huge difference to urban communities. My understanding is that if you look at the latest discussion paper coming out from the Scottish Government on the Community Empowerment Bill, there is a strong hint on the universality of the community right to buy. They are certainly looking at using that mechanism to have an appropriate community right to buy for urban as well as rural areas.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There are other issues of course.

In a more dispersed population, it is sometimes a harder thing to put together.

I thought it was mentioned in the latest discussion papers but I will have a look at it. It is certainly being talked about and we are very hopeful that it will be considered. On the rural versus urban, the issues in urban are different in as much as there is the whole issue of dereliction and not being used—of land banking. I can think of loads of examples where a key asset in a community has been lying idle and has deteriorated. It would be a phenomenal asset for the community, but somebody is banking it and waiting for the good times to come again; they might develop it and sell it on. I would say that in an urban context the whole issue of land banking for housing—waiting until things pick up and renovating a hotel into flats—is a bigger issue than it is in rural areas. It would make a big difference if it was extended to an urban situation.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">As somebody said earlier, community right to buy has not resulted in a lot of direct transactions using the legislation that is there in the background. We would hope that an improved community right to buy would be more useful, whether it is in the urban circumstance of a key asset with a lot of potential being derelict, or whether it is the absolute right to buy that people talk about to force a sale.

Community enterprises and groups are lumped in with the private sector as commercial enterprises, whereas a lot of communities see themselves as very local and small scale—public sector; it is just public ownership on a very small local scale. Yet in all their transactions vis-à-vis state aids and other things they are seen to be just like any other private operator. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">A couple of years ago, we suggested that there might be scope for having a new approved scheme.

We have been trying to be clear on this for a long time and trying to find ways of supporting communities to buy assets. Between us, we have invested about £75 million in over 300,000 acres of land coming into community ownership. That has largely been through willing sellers and negotiated sales at market value. To that extent, anything that helps us do that, we would thoroughly welcome, because that is the business we are in.

There is quite a complicated thing about whether it is different organisations or whether it can be trading subsidiaries.

That is well established among development trusts and land trusts. You have a charitable parent and then you have the trading activity done by a non-charitable trading share company. The charity regulator in Scotland, OSCR, is similarly concerned, as HMRC have been, on the tax issues of charities, etc. It is quite a well established thing to have this charitable parent and trading activities, but you do not want to set that up for a relatively small project. As I said, I am not aware of the ins and outs of it as far as it relates to state aids, but it is a well proven principle as far as charitable taxation goes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I would also say that the likes of the Lottery would be quite familiar with it.

Of the 436,000 acres, or whatever, that were in community land at that point, most of that was through 17 large estates at that time. In relation to the earlier point about urban land, just 3% of the assets—not acres but just assets—are in the 5% most deprived areas. On the merging of the agendas, I do not think the Scottish Government will necessarily always want to concentrate on that sheer physical area of assets, rather it is on the impact it is having in terms of regeneration, community empowerment and economic activity. I would hope that that target becomes a more added-value target.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q269 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Ah, the target becomes an aspiration and then it becomes an indicative figure.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rory Dutton</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: No, I meant if you had more community ventures and people employed.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q270 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It needs to be complemented by other targets, doesn’t it?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rory Dutton</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Because we are largely looking at the question of land reform, we have tended to look at it in the context of acreages and so on, rather than in terms of small urban </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">developments</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and the like.

The current Scottish Land Fund started in July 2012 and has a four-year life, supported with £9 million of investment from the Scottish Government. There are about 77 applications or referrals from the Big Lottery to HIE that we are dealing with at the moment. There are a number of approvals that have gone through. The acquisition of assets and land by communities is not an overnight occurrence. Communities take it very seriously, and the due diligence and feasibility work that communities put in up front is not inconsiderable. The arrival and the trading of the Land Fund certainly provided a number of communities with the opportunity to start to think about how they might pursue that as an opportunity. In terms of the earlier Land Fund, perhaps Neil might have more on that than me.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Neil Ritch</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I do. The original Land Fund opened for business in 2001. It had funded 117 acquisitions by 2006. When the original Land Fund closed, the Big Lottery Fund opened a different funding programme called Growing Community Assets, which funded most of what the Scottish Land Fund would have funded, but also funded urban assets and asset development. Growing Community Assets, between 2006 and 2010, made 127 awards worth £48 million. I am not quite sure how that 2005 figure has been derived.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The majority of all the original Scottish Land Fund was invested in rural </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, which is to say settlements of 10,000 people or fewer.

There are 11 Scottish Land Fund approvals that have gone through, only two of which have included an element of state aid. The approach to maximise the no aid argument that HIE takes has been able to be delivered in its entirety in nine out of the 11. To my knowledge, there have been no state aid refusals in the way that you describe—communities going away from the Scottish Land Fund per se absolutely not engaged with us any longer. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q278 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> In relation to the target group of 11 that you are measuring, I am not clear whether or not there were aspirations that were crushed before they got to that stage.

You might end up with nine out of 1,000 if it was a question of people who had expressed a desire.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rachael McCormack</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The partnership between HIE and the Big Lottery around the Scottish Land Fund is that the Big Lottery undertake an initial appraisal discussion with applicants to determine that they are fit, and then they make a referral on to HIE.

When the community bought </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Gigha</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, they bought it with a fairly outline plan of what they might do. To a very large extent they were not coming and saying, “We have this very clear commercial vision.” They were able to communicate that they saw potential in the island, but they clearly had some severe challenges, not least of which was that almost all the housing was judged unfit for habitation. They clearly had a whole bunch of difficulties to deal with and what they have since done has been pretty fantastic. The funding that went into simply transferring the ownership of that asset to the community was, in our view at that time, a reasonable thing to do and did not create a risk that was unacceptable to us.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Subsequently, over time, they have developed a range of projects.

If he had not got the commercial arm—the business plan—worked out and if it had been much less coherent and less sustainable, he would have had a much greater chance of getting the buying of the location through and then he could work out all the rest of it later on.

I said that they would need to change approaches. One of the approaches that needs to be looked at—and we have not had a chance to look at it today but it might fall under the remit of your Committee—is the identification of the benefit to the public purse of the sale of the public asset; whether that is a purely financial calculation or whether they should take into account the social and economic benefits. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">When we fill in application forms as a community group, whether to get permission to buy or to get the funds to buy, we have to make a point about the economic benefits we produce, the social benefits we produce and the environmental benefits we produce. All three of those are measured equally by the decision makers in our right to buy and in our funders. But when we go to get a valuation on the land, because we are buying from the public purse, they only look at the economic value of that land. They do not look at any of our social or environmental benefits.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What really frustrates me—this is a personal thing—is I get told that they are protecting the taxpayers’ interests, yet the community that wants to buy are taxpayers and it would be in our interest to have it transferred. That interpretation of the Treasury rules is something that needs to be looked at. If they could find a different way of interpreting it to include social and environmental benefits, it would bring down asking prices and increase the transfer opportunity of the land.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q283 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The Big Lottery Fund mentioned something along the same lines.

Do you have examples of that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Eric Samuel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: As we said earlier, and as we explain in the evidence, for purely practical reasons, as we have a finite sum of money, we tend to ask applicants who want to take over assets to try and get a reduced value. What you might get in some cases are local authorities saying that they cannot do that. On the other hand we know, because we have experience of it across the last 10 years or so, that they can get round that when they want to do that, and still comply with the legislation. That is the problem.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q285 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> For the record, you are saying that many of the public bodies, particularly local authorities, would be able to reduce the price if they wished to do so and still be within Treasury guidelines and the Scottish Government’s finance manual.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Eric Samuel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Our experience is that they do it. It is not for us to inquire how they have done that, but as long as they offer these communities a discount we are quite happy with that. It has happened. There are various ways they can do it. They can still charge full value but give the group a grant for the equivalent amount, so it is just a total paper exercise. There are ways they can do it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Neil Ritch</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It links to a concern—a number of communities have said this—that owning the asset is the start of the process for those communities. If you exhaust all of your resources in the purchase of the asset and you do not have capital to then invest in doing things with that asset, that is a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">difficulty</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> for us. We think we get more return for those communities by investing lottery grant money in developing the asset once you have ownership of it, than just the bare ownership itself.

There was a statutory instrument from 2010 passed by the Scottish Parliament about the disposal of land by local authorities, which means that local authorities no longer have to go to the Minister. If they can justify transferring an asset, land or building at a nominal sum because of the wider benefits, they can do that. They do not have to ask anybody; it is within their power. Agencies always get bogged down in these Treasury rules. That is where we really want to see the movement—in the Treasury rules—because there are a lot of other public agencies, other than local authorities, who have surplus assets.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q287 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Let me clarify this.

I was asked a question about whether the Scottish Government was indeed minded to make it universal. Would you note that it is on page 18 and in question 17. It follows paragraph 67. It does say that “the Scottish Government proposes to extend right to buy to communities in all parts of Scotland, where the Scottish Government is satisfied that it is in the public interest.” So they are asking the question and they are saying that they intend doing it; what do you think of it? That answers the question the gentleman asked earlier.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rachael McCormack</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Could I reiterate a point made by Neil? Whilst I appreciate that the Committee is focusing on land reform, the acquisition of land by communities is by no means the end of the journey. Neil referred to it as the start. It is the start perhaps after two or three years of fairly intensive exploration by a community. Community ownership bestows many benefits. Communities fundamentally step forward and take responsibility. They look for new opportunities and plan sustainably. It is innate within their community-owned asset that they are thinking not just about a short-term gain but an inter-generational transfer over time. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">They respond to community needs because community organisations are charged, and wish to be charged, with that remit. Very powerfully, communities have a stake in their own future so local people are making decisions about local priorities and local needs. They are able to respond with strong development plans. As Neil has said, they include things that they want to do for their community, for their society but also for the local economy. As you study, as you will, the land reform agenda, I think that is probably the most salient and most powerful agenda for ourselves as HIE.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q290 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> That was a paean of praise for community development, and we appreciate and understand that. That is why we are in favour of this and that is why we are having these hearings.
