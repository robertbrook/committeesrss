ESA missions have covered planetary exploration (from the Giotto mission to Halley’s Comet in 1986 to forthcoming spacecraft to Mars and Mercury); observation of the Sun (SOHO, jointly with NASA) and the wider Universe (good examples being the infrared Herschel telescope and Planck satellite). Its satellites have also played and continue to play a key role in Earth observation (including the ice monitoring satellite Cryosat and the SWARM satellite that will study the terrestrial magnetosphere) and have given us a real insight into the processes that shape our planet.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="4" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.25pt; padding-left:4.75pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">ESA appears to be largely effective as an organisation, in that with a total budget of €4.3bn, less than one third that of NASA, it has delivered world-class space missions for scientific and civil applications. In 2011, the ESA allocation for science was €465m, whilst €129.4m was set aside for robotic exploration, €844m for Earth observation and €410.9m for human spaceflight. The largely efficient use of these resources has allowed Europe to take the lead in a number of areas, for example in the ESA Euclid mission to explore dark energy, where NASA cancelled its proposed equivalent project but later elected to support the European spacecraft.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="5" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.25pt; padding-left:4.75pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Unlike bilateral arrangements between states, ESA has no dominant partner and member states are free to opt in (or not) to the majority of programmes.

A recent example is the selection of the L1 (large) class mission, where the JUICE probe to Jupiter was selected in competition with the gravitational wave observatory NGO and the X-ray observatory ATHENA. The three proposals related to very different areas of science and yet were tensioned against each other, inevitably leading to some controversy around the final decision.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="8" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.25pt; padding-left:4.75pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">One area that may not be as efficient is the requirement to use ESA facilities to do work such as the processing of data from ESA missions.

The implementation of the so-called ‘dual key’ approach, whereby the Space Agency supports the development of scientific missions and the research councils support the exploitation of mission data, is still a matter of concern for some members of the scientific community, particularly in geophysics.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="19" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 5pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">These researchers are critical of that relationship, where they are asked to find funding for exploitation from the normal research council grants programme. Taking the example of the SWARM mission, scientists are struggling to become involved with the early processing of data from the spacecraft, meaning that the UK misses out on this aspect of ‘georeturn’ (see the next section). The capital investment in mission development through the UK Space Agency is then not necessarily being realised in access to its scientific output. Rather than being a matter of process, this seems to reflect constrained resources in both the Space Agency and the research councils.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:5pt 0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Does the UK get good value for money from its membership of ESA?

There are some countries which do better than this, notably the Netherlands with a georeturn value of 1.10, but on the whole the UK georeturn is as expected. There is also significant variation between programmes, with the UK receiving a return as low as 0.34 from activities at the Guyana Space Centre and as high as 3.34 for launchers.

In dealing with such extremes (whether space weather or other natural hazards) it is vital to exploit the long-term view and insight that research can provide. That view transcends individual and organisational memory and can significantly improve resilience against natural hazards.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="26" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Severe space weather falls firmly in this frame as shown by the recommendations of the Royal Academy for a range of research activities, including better measurements of space weather conditions on the Sun, in interplanetary space and at the Earth, and better modelling of those conditions in order to improve our forecasting capabilities.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="27" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">This is where the role of ESA and the UK Space Agency are crucial.
