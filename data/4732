Employment is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to youth unemployment. In reality there are lots of related issues such as underemployment, the shape of the jobs market, the ladder without the middle rungs that we describe, or the hourglass shape, and we need to look beyond just unemployment to underemployment and progression.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Finally, it is so important—and I am so pleased that we are represented here today—to involve young people and students in the solutions to youth unemployment.

Tomorrow a group of us are going off to </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Birmingham</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> to do exactly the same. It was one of our Members who said, “What about youth?

We are an organisation that was launched by students four years ago and our focus is job creation through entrepreneurship and getting young people to set up businesses. We operate at 80 universities and 110 college campuses and it is all run by students and student networks.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q128 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> That sounds wonderful. Thank you. What do you think the impacts of youth unemployment on young people are and do you think that this issue affects particular types of young people more than others? Can we have quick snappy answers? I think most of us have some idea now after all these witness sessions, but could you answer that one please?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Chris Neal:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Young people face a number of challenges when they are unemployed. BYC did a consultation of between 800 and 1,000 young people recently, which we submitted direct to the European Commission as part of a process they did to engage with young people. As part of the consultation, we found five key things young people face when unemployed. They suffer mental health issues, depression, a feeling of worthlessness</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">—</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">“I have these skills to bring but I cannot give them to anybody because nobody will accept what I am looking for”. It also causes some issues at home; if you are living with your parents, it causes tension in households. Also under-support and things around debt, because you are unemployed, you are not earning an income, right through to drug and alcohol abuse and that feeling of worthlessness.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The second point is that numbers of young people over time, different groups, have experienced unemployment in different ways. Rachel was talking about underemployment and there are a lot of young people who are qualified but cannot get the jobs that they are qualified to do. They are pushing those ones that are not as qualified out of the job market because they are fulfilling jobs that they are not qualified for.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rachel Wenstone:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> We did some research with students—the most privileged group of potentially unemployed young people—and even within that group there is anxiety and a high level of stress about finding a job, finding a well paid job and a job that matches their skill level. It is important to say that education is the silver bullet to lots of these issues in that if you have no qualifications unemployment is around 33% in comparison to 8% for graduates, but there is a big disparity within that. If you look at, for example, different types of graduates, those from Russell Group institutions are more likely to be able to access higher</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">-</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">skilled jobs than others. There is a stark difference even between no qualifications and the lowest level of qualifications. So for a young person with level 2 qualifications, five GCSEs, there is an unemployment rate of about 12%. That is compared to no qualifications of about 33%. Going through some level of education is very important.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The hourglass economy, the missing middle bit, means that often graduates are forced into underemployment, into lower</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">-</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">skilled jobs, and that forces those without qualifications out of the bottom of the economy and into unemployment. It is worth saying it has serious consequences for the future </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> jobs market when we lose highly skilled people to retirement in the next 30 years. There will not be people to replace those jobs and that is quite serious.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">In terms of different types of unemployed people, half of young black men are unemployed in comparison to a fifth of young white men. I think that is something we should take really seriously. Disabled people are 30% more likely to be unemployed and young women are more likely to be in employment but often stagnate at the lowest level of pay on the lower skill level. I think these are very serious issues.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Hushpreet Dhaliwal:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> There are a couple of things here that are really different </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">from </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">unemployment in comparison to the way it has been in previous years or previous decades. One of the key things at the moment among graduates is that there are 115,000 graduates now who have been unemployed for in excess of two years. These people are not getting experience and training, and there is a bit of expectation management to do with the employers who are expecting people straight out of education or straight out of another job to join their workforce. They are not calling in people for interviews who are not employed or are underemployed for the best part of two years and that is a problem. There is expectation management to do there.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">I think the big issue</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> though</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> is mismanagement of aspiration. There is real lack of understanding among this generation and some serious confusion of the opportunities that exist for them in career planning and ending up in a job. Every year the FE sector generates more hairdressers than there are currently hairdressers. It absolutely does not make any sense. We are not giving the right advice when trying to negotiate with a young individual and deciding on their career path. A plumbing job today could get you £70,000 a year; £70,000 a year you could earn being a plumber.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> From plumbing?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Hushpreet Dhaliwal:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Absolutely, and yet we have a deficit of those skills in the marketplace because we are not managing that. So there is that area.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">When I look at the people who are most at risk it is probably those who are in training for jobs that do not exist or jobs that will not exist going forward. It is those who are on an educational track that is tied to attainment of education versus skills and training. The idea still that individuals with degree-based education get preference over those </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">who </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">come out of colleges and so on is a big problem. There is a cultural shift that the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> needs to undertake in understanding that training via other means is just as valuable for the kind of economy we are building.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The other thing that I would point out is, of course, regional. There is a deficit of opportunity depending on where you are raised, access to opportunity if you are born in certain parts of the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> versus others or have access to certain parts of education versus others.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Thank you.

I disagree with the idea that students and young people are training for the wrong jobs. The diversity in the amount and types of education that people are coming into the labour market with is far greater than the diversity within the labour market itself. Young people are presenting the labour market with a high level of skills in different areas and the labour market is not reacting. One area where it has reacted is the creative arts industry. </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Ten </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">years ago people reacted to so-called Mickey Mouse degrees and these are the degrees that are now going on to make this recession-busting industry. I think we have to be careful about fixing—</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Type casting.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rachel Wenstone:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Also fixing education for the labour market when the labour market is not moving around different types of education.

I have two very simple questions. Which initiatives are the most effective, in your judgment, and to what extent are young people aware of the most effective initiatives?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Chris Neal:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> We welcome any measures </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">that </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Governments in the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> or the European Union decide to implement to support young people. BYC has not undertaken great research into this area. My personal perspective of it is that the most effective systems are the ones that engage with young people. If you can engage with young people, they want to engage and they want to participate and they become very active in what they are doing. If you say, “This is what you are going to do, get on with it”, it is not going to happen. What you need to say is, “As a partnership agreement, what do we need to do? What is the end goal? What are we trying to achieve together?” I think there is great stuff; the youth contract is a way forward to do that. There is the development of the Erasmus programme moving into the next budgetary period. There are some great ideas and I think it is how you promote to young people as well.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">There is stuff around formal education</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> and the view that </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">the way forward is that all young people will engage with a formal education. That is not right. Some people go to colleges, some people are out of the education sector, and it is how you get to those groups outside of the education sector to promote the resources to. It is okay targeting the normal channels, but we need to start to think differently and outside of those normal channels to engage with young people who get lost in the system.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rachel Wenstone:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> We agree with the idea of the youth contract and the principle of it. What has really worried us is the take-up of the youth contract. I think there has to be greater engagement from universities and colleges with employers as opposed to expecting employers to be able to reach out to young people and young people to know where those opportunities are.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">With the work programme, however, I have real concerns with a programme that forces a young person to languish in unemployment and take </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">jobseeker’s allowance </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">before help is available to them. Where young people are asked to create the solutions to youth unemployment they probably would not say that forcing them to be unemployed for nine months first would be the solution. That is where it becomes very obvious that we need to engage with young people more.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The information, advice and guidance available to young people </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">are </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">absolutely atrocious. When the Government cut Aimhigher and Connexions</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> they cut a lifeline to many young people. We know, for example, that those people graduating from further education rely much more on their social networks and their local connections to find work. That means that they are relying on locally available work, on the social capital that comes with that and on the perceptions and expectations of them that exist. They are not looking beyond the opportunities available to them.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Of course, not having centrally funded, centrally administered information, advice and guidance to young people means that you are relying on schools and colleges to provide that. It is often underfunded and undertrained. It comes with people’s own perceptions of what is right and wrong. There are all sorts of things that force schools to make different decisions</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">. For </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">example</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> you have schools deciding to push people towards higher education because they get moved up in the league table because of that. You do not get moved up the league table if you go into an apprenticeship, even if it is a high level apprenticeship, so there are difficulties there.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">For the opportunities available through </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">, again it is an issue of information, advice and guidance. We send half the number of students that we take in on the Erasmus programme. There are all sorts of issues about what is expected of you when you go to </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">. Lots of people think that they need a second language, when you do not, and language provision in schools, particularly in poorer areas, is often awful, so again that comes with all sorts of social barriers. Ultimately </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">j</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">obcentres and careers advisers are not set up to give people the opportunities available to them in Europe, which is a great shame because there are an awful lot of young people losing out on opportunities available to them.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Do you have anything to add to that?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Hushpreet Dhaliwal:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Only to reinforce that I think a lot of support and guidance that is received by young people is based on the competencies of local infrastructure, like Jobcentre Plus and other delivery bodies, and that is a real problem. When we speak to our network, there are real disparities between individuals. Certain universities and colleges have a clear understanding of what programmes like Erasmus expect of them versus another. That is not even just on the student side; it is also on the SME side. We speak to SMEs who say, “We do not understand how to engage with things like work incentives”.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Chris Neal:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Can I add one further point? The education maintenance allowance was almost a backbone for young people to go, “Okay, I have reached 16. I am going to leave formal education. I might not want to then get a job. I want to go and study”. For some young people, great, it still exists. For wider than that it is terrible for young people to think, “I do not want to leave education but I feel I have to leave education because my family background, social background, cannot keep me in that place”. I think there is something about how that could address the issue of unemployment and giving young people the security while they continue to develop their skills for employment.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q130 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Yes, I am sure.

I think it is quite dangerous in how it sets up the employer and employee relationship. We have the evidence to prove it. We did a piece of research with GTI Media and Step and asked small employers about their experience with graduates</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> 82% of small employers were happy or very happy with the graduates they had taken on and half the respondents said that graduates were better than they were five years ago. So it is not true. It is not to say that there are not serious issues. There are not the jobs out there and ultimately there are not the jobs for the skilled graduates in the market, so it is not a skills deficit, it is a jobs quality deficit. I think that is important to emphasise.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">At the moment it feels like the responsibility only flows in one direction. It flows from the student, it is the student’s responsibility, it is the young person’s responsibility to be work ready. </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Twenty </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">years ago these people were not ultimately work ready but there was an expectation that they went in at mid-level jobs, they would be trained in the job, they would understand the cultures of the workplace and they would become work ready. To expect young people to present themselves on the first day of work, or even before that at an interview stage—and there </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">is </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">all sorts of cultural norming as well that go</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">es</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> on around that, around the expectation of how young people dress or speak, the background that they come from, the social capital that they bring with them. We need to be quite explicit about tackling some of those stereotypes and cultures if we are going to tackle these issues.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">There </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">is </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">a group of young people </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">who </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">lack training. They are the group of people that Chris was talking about, those people who have been unable to stay in training because of the lack of support financially through the education maintenance allowance and so on. It is not to say that everybody is work ready, but ultimately again they have been let down by the system. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Chris Neal</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: I think it is quite a bad situation when employers have a monopoly on young people. Young people cannot defend themselves when there are 100 young people applying for one job from an employer. It is hard for young people to go to a job interview. For example, my personal experience is that I finished uni and I was out of work for eight months. I went to jobs, got interviews and was told, “Sorry, you are underqualified. Sorry, you are overqualified”. It is that balance, that I do not have the experience or the knowledge or whatever that employer is looking for, which they can use as an excuse not to employ you. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">I think a lot of young people have the right skills but, </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">as </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">we said earlier about underemployment, they are working in jobs they are not trained for. They do not have the education to support them. Only in November the UK Youth Parliament sat in the House of Commons and they were talking about the curriculum for life. Young people want an education that prepares them for employment and work and real life. This is the second year that they have talked about it and discussed it and debated on it. There is a campaign running now in the Youth Parliament about </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">the fact </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">that young people want to get engaged in education and they want education that will develop their skills to go out into the economy in the future whatever it looks like, whether it is green jobs, infrastructure jobs, IT jobs. They will be ready and prepared to go into employment. </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">As </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Rachel said, there is a small group of young people who do not have the skills</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> but that is a very tiny minority.

You have an increase in unpaid internships where people are expected to work for a year or two years without pay and other examples of really exploitative, I would say, work regimes but it is not work because you are not being paid for it. I think you are right that it is important to look to small and medium businesses to fill that gap because so far we have seen big employers just take advantage of that gap. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q135 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Baroness Valentine:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> I should probably declare at this point that </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">when I am not here </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">I am Chief Executive of London First, which is a business-sponsored organisation.

I am trying to get under the skin of what you are saying. I certainly recognise employers saying that the people they employ do not turn up for work on time and do not seem to be applying themselves to the job in hand. There are lot of leisure and hospitality jobs in </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> but typically they do not go to Londoners.

If you are talking about the willingness to work on poverty pay, below London living wage for example, and take on a task that you are overqualified for when you have been promised, “Stay in education, get a degree, get a good qualification, you will go and get a good job”, that is something quite different. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Baroness Valentine:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> But at the moment there are not all those jobs that we would like to have for those sorts of people. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rachel Wenstone</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: No, but then I find it quite difficult to have the conversation that students and graduates and unemployed young people are not ready to work if the jobs just do not exist. We are asking young people to be more competitive, to take on experience, often unpaid, to do more and more and more, and compete and compete and compete to get the jobs available, but those jobs are not available in the first place. We are almost lying to young people twice. We are saying, “Stay in education and you will get a job, and while you are there you need to work harder and harder and harder, and we promise you will get something”. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Baroness</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold"> Valentine:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> There are obviously different types of jobs that we are talking about, so there are a lot of leisure and hospitality jobs that you might regard as poorly paid and therefore not appropriate for the graduates that are becoming available. If in practice we have that mismatch, I am not quite sure where we are going with that conversation. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rachel Wenstone</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: Then I think the labour market has to react better to the types of education and skills that people have. Your organisation is a key example of where that exists. The creative arts industry is the perfect example where people were quite snobby towards Mickey Mouse, new media, creative arts type degrees and yet computer technology, for example, and games technology is vast and it is growing on a day-to-day basis. We are world leading in computer games technology. Ultimately the labour market has to do more to react to the skills that graduates and young people are coming out with as opposed to expecting young people to just take the work that is available. Our jobs market will stagnate and go backwards 20 years as opposed to moving forward and creating new industries and innovative ways of creating employment. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Chris Neal</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">On s</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">omething that Rachel was saying</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">, </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">it is about the national minimum wage.

BIS did an excellent review of this, that SMEs are quite timid about the idea of coming on to campus and displaying themselves as a place where young people can launch their careers. On the other side of it, graduates think that SMEs are not the place that they should be launching their careers and instead they get jobs where they are underemployed and wait another year for the milk run to come round. What we need is for people to stay in Leeds and </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Huddersfield</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">, create value locally, either by starting a business or joining local small firms. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q136 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> I think we have had one answer to this already, but do you think support is available to young people at the moment that enables them to make a successful transition from school, and I think I will add to that university also, through to a good job and a career? Rachel said earlier it was atrocious, so she has given an answer already. If she has, could she tell us then what in fact should be happening to put the problem in its proper context? Following that through so that Hushpreet can come in with it too, do you think that being an entrepreneur is an achievable career option for young people? How could the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> or the EU work to help young people to fund and start up their own companies and go into business on their own? There are two questions there, please. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rachel Wenstone</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: I think to bring back centrally organised careers advice, to bring back Aimhigher and Connexions. It is fascinating when you talk to universities now, dealing with the deficit in careers advice in schools, the answer they will always give is, “What we need is some sort of regional or nationally funded careers adviser”, and we had that. I think honestly the only solution really is to bring back what we had, Aimhigher and Connexions, but there is a regional point as well. For example, the universities in </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> have worked very well together to keep graduates in the city and to provide them </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">with </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">opportunities, and for them to understand the opportunities that are available to them. There is the need for a national careers advice framework, information, advice and guidance, but what institutions, colleges and universities can do with local authorities to keep young people in the local area and create employment I think is huge. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">There is a point I have to make, and it links to the question before. Most graduates in our research said that they would like to work for the public sector because of the job progression, the pay and the security. Places like </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Newcastle</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">, for example, used to have two</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">thirds of its job opportunities via the public sector, which no longer exists. It is no wonder that people are looking to move out of those areas if the jobs simply do not exist. </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">University</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> is a good example of where they work together with colleges and the local authority to create those opportunities. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Hushpreet Dhaliwal</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: No, there is not a clear pathway and the problem is that schools, colleges and universities are incredibly disconnected. It is a very disconnected journey for a young individual. We are entering an era of lifelong learning where people are constantly going to have to skill up and top up. Every couple of years our skills sets are going to become outdated in parallel to the changes in technology and what is happening and the way that global talent will compete. We are just not set up to respond to that. The greatest disconnect is that journey for a young individual who is trying to map and route their career and does not quite understand where those opportunities lie. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">One of the best things that we could probably do about that is start speaking to the LEPs about creating local boards. When we start talking about things like student voice, every single LEP should have a student or youth board that helps guide their enterprise programmes and development of their enterprise programmes. Every single LEP needs to have a youth entrepreneurship strategy, absolutely. We also need to task local organisations to start acting as conduits and the hubs for local support. This is not about building heavy national infrastructure programmes. This is about well done dissemination locally, and that really varies per region, per county and being responsive to that. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Chris Neal</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: From our perspective, the simple answer is no. We consulted 500,000 young people—we are willing to share the report with the Committee—and after a curriculum for life that prepares young people, they told us careers advice and work experience </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">are </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">a very shoddy, ad hoc approach across the country, and young people are falling through the cracks because the right support and advice when they need it is not there. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rachel Wenstone</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: To add on that as well, it is worth saying that there is one remaining national careers adviser and that is Inspiring the Future, which promotes apprenticeships, and that is doing good work. It is important to promote and fund that further if we are going to be serious about balancing the opportunities that are available to young people. So there is one that still exists. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q137 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Thank you.

I think it lies with society, </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">g</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">overnment, business to adapt. Young people engage with social change. You saw the development of mobile phones, tablet computers, wireless internet; the world is changing and young people stay engaged with it. I think big institutions like </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">g</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">overnment do not actually develop and change.

Everybody around this table has a computer and we think we are computer literate. I remember at one of the conferences we went to one of the countries that has a presidency—I cannot remember which—said that if every person in youth unemployment in that country just developed better IT skills there would be jobs for them.

The pushback is their institutions who will not react quick</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">ly</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> enough to deal with some of the changes in technology. There are some great examples, such as at university where students are able to do chemical experiments online.

A good example of the way that we talk about IT proficiency is the question on a job application, “Are you IT proficient?” You used to be able to show that through a qualification. Now I think for most young people filling in that job application it would be more the question, “What do you mean by this? Can I use a word processor? Yes, of course I can, but what else?” So </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">there should be an </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">understanding of that. There is a point that links to what you said before about this </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">being </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">an issue of retraining and reskilling and the opportunity for lifelong learning that comes with that, but also recognition that there are young people out there who do not have access to educational equipment at a very young age</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">—young people</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> in rural areas </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">who </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">do not have access to the internet</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> for example. I suppose it cannot be taken as a given that young people have access to those things. I think that the structures that they work in are normally more hesitant to react to these things than the young people themselves are. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Hushpreet Dhaliwal</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: I agree with the point that Rachel has just made. There has been a balancing out of opportunity because there are young people carrying around 3G phones more than there ever has been. You have an interface that you can engage with to prevent people dropping out of the system and that is something that we need to begin to utilise better. The other interesting thing is that I was recently talking to a careers department and they were questioning what their role now is in the age of more self-education. In an age where any young person can access as much as they want about absolutely anything they want in relation to their careers and career planning, what does that then mean the role of the institution is? It is pretty concerning that there are those kinds of questions happening at the careers department end of it, because young people need guidance. There is a whole raft of programmes that are not suitable or </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">that are </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">misleading.

Schools, colleges, universities are the local hubs that have touch points with these young people. They have to be the people </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">who </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">say, “No matter what you encounter out there in the world of work, whatever extracurricular opportunity you are engaging in, we are going to be your hub.

Do you think migration of labour is a help or hindrance? </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rachel Wenstone</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: I think it is a huge opportunity lost for most of our young people. You have people from the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">c</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">ontinent who able to come here and train and skill and understand different work cultures and take those skills back to improve their labour forces and job markets, and our young people do not take up those opportunities. They do not take them up because they do not know about them, but they also do not take them up because of, as I said before, the social barriers that exist that stop people doing that, the confidence issues, the financial support, understanding that you have parents or guardians that will be there when you get lost in a foreign country to pick up the phone. There are real issues around the culture in the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> of thinking that we do things best. There is an awful lot to learn from the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">c</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">ontinent and it is something we should be proud to do and proud to support young people to do. But the first issue is that people just do not know about those opportunities. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Chris Neal</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: I fully agree. I had never heard of the Erasmus programme until I </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">had </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">finished university and had a job, so that is quite concerning. The idea, the concept is great. It is more </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">about </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">delivery. Is it something that young people can look at? Is it something that is detailed in text? Is it interactive? But also is there an opportunity to develop it further? Is there an opportunity to not just put jobs on there but develop it into a work experience portal, an internship, paid internships and, as I said before, create almost a hub for young people? If they are looking for something particular, they can use it to broaden their experiences overseas. Rachel is right. There are lot more young people who know about things like Erasmus overseas and coming to the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> than </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> groups. There is an opportunity for organisations like BYC, NUS and other partners to be used to promote the opportunities that are out there, because we have networks of thousands of young people and young adults. We do not sometimes get the message to them in the right way and I think the message delivery needs to massively improve. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Did you want to add something? </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Hushpreet Dhaliwal</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: Only that immigration largely, I think, is a good thing but we have to accept that, given the numbers of youth unemployment, we are starting off on a bit of a back foot. How do we get young people ready for what will be a more competitive market, a marketplace that they will learn from if they are given the opportunity to engage with it? </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q141 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Baroness Hooper:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> May I </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">ask </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">a supplementary? I happen to know that the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> quota of jobs in the European Commission is not filled by quite a large percentage because of the lack of language skills. I know you </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">said </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">earlier—I think it was Rachel—that that is not really an issue but I think it is, certainly for the better jobs and the more skilled jobs. Can you, as young people, do anything? I am certainly campaigning for more language teaching in schools and better levels of language teaching. Is there anything that you think you can do to fill that particular gap? </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rachel Wenstone</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: Often the provision of language skills </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">is </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">better in private and independent schools. If you are coming from a local state school, from an underprivileged area, the provision of language is not something that is seen as necessarily important or something that is prioritised. It has implications, of course, in the way that people engage with English. It is not just having to engage with foreign languages. I think if people understood the opportunities available to them outside the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> more and that was ingrained at an earlier age, they may prioritise learning foreign languages. It is the point I made before, that the expectation that you must speak a foreign language well in order to take up an opportunity in Europe is not always necessarily the case for all of the opportunities available, and having that honest conversation with people about what is expected in order to be able to take up these opportunities and how you can help yourself do that through your education. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q142 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Thank you. Does any Member of the Committee have a burning question to ask? No? I want to ask one. What do you feel about zero</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">-</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">hours contracts? Do they help or hinder young people? One of the witnesses suggested that flexibility is helpful. We have also heard evidence to the contrary. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Chris Neal</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: Our members have not told us their views on that. My personal opinion is it can be balanced either way. I have been on a zero</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">-</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">hours contract. It was great because I had the flexibility, but also there was the insecurity of not knowing what I </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">was </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">working from one week to the next. I think for some young people it is great but there need to be some tighter controls around how they are managed and developed. It is not just about zero hours. It is about all the other rights that go with employment and young people need rights when they are in employment. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rachel Wenstone</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: I agree.

They will find a way to get around that. I think zero</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">-</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">hour contracts create the basis for exploitation, and we have to be quite careful about that. Flexibility and listening to people’s needs and care and responsibilities, for example, is important in the workplace, but exploiting them and not giving them job security is not helpful. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Hushpreet Dhaliwal</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: Work experience in any form and some sort of positive engagement in work is a good thing, but it is a real problem when you operate on a zero</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">-</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">hours contract where you do not know from one day to the next when you are going to be called in.

When I was your age apprenticeships were terrific and great and people that I know who started off with apprenticeships ended up as heads of big corporations, but then something went off the boil. We had evidence last week about Barclays creating 400 apprenticeships, but the problem there was—and I heard this during the weekend from another area—that they had to make sure that </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">the people </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">could read and write and were capable of doing maths.

We touched quite a lot on formal education but not remembering what is learnt through non-formal education, also informal education. What soft skills do people learn at home?
