font-size:11pt">shed research findings, with which, of course, the Committee will be familiar, between 15% and 20% of educational outcomes can be attributed to schooling.  This is not an insignificant figure but it nevertheless provides an important context for any discus</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">sion of how any model of school provision can improve the prospects of children from deprived backgrounds.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">  </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">ii) </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">There is no great secret </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">as to why children from deprived backgrounds do relatively poorly at school and there is no need to take up the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Committee’s time by rehearsing the reasons</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, all of which have to do with the complex interaction of motivation and resources</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">.  The question is how schools can help such children and whether or not the academy model is relevant.  </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The theory behind the model</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> is that academy schools, not being bound by the National Curriculum,  are “free to innovate” but this idea, even if true, assumes that the needs of deprived children can be addressed by “innovation” (whatever that means)</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">In terms of curriculum content, a</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">cademy schools are, of course, no more free to “innovate” than any other type of school, for the simple reason that they are evaluated with reference to their pupils’ performance in “high stakes”, externally administered examinations</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">.  They are, of course,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> free to experiment with such things as the length of the school day and the length and number of school terms and they are free, up to a point, to set their own terms and conditions for the employment of teachers but few academy schools have shown any wis</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">h to make use of these freedoms and there is no reason to suppose that, if they did, it would help to narrow the attainment gap between deprived children and the rest.  These “freedoms” are simply not relevant to the problem.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">  It is, therefore, not surpris</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">ing that, claim</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">s</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> to the contrary by the DFE notwithstanding, academy schools overall have failed to bring about any narrowing of the attainment gap between deprived and other children.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">  </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Of course, it is possible to point to particular academy schools that </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">have achieved excellent results but to generalise from such examples is not helpful.  A case in point is Mossbourne </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Academy, which has achieved spectacularly better results than its predecessor, Hackney Downs School.  It is impossible</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, however,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> to show tha</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">t Mossbourne’s success is in any way due to its status as an academy, rather than to a combination of outstanding leadership, superior resources and a pupil intake</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> much less deprived than that of its predecessor.  </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Indeed, among the original group of “City </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Academies” set up by Labour, Mossbourne is almost uniquely successful.  </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">  </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">iii) However, the experience of other countries, most notably Finland, shows that there are measures which could be taken to make school a more positive and successful experience f</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">or the children under discussion.  Firstly, our</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> secondary</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> schools should be made genuinely comprehensive in character.  There is considerable evidence, of which the Committee will be aware, that </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">the climate of learning within a school is optimised when a m</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">inimum of 25% of the pupils are well motivated to succeed and already support the school’s educational aims.  Such children may be called a “critical mass” and their presence in a school has been shown to have a powerful effect upon the motivation of the m</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">ajority of other pupils.  To obtain such a “critical mass” in every school requires admissions policies to be based upon the need for every school to have a socially and academically balanced intake but to achieve this would require a level of leadership a</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">nd courage that seems no longer</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> to exist among our politicians, who, since 1988 have adhered to a consum</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">erist model of schooling, in which the provision of “choice and diversity” is given priority over the actual effectiveness of outcomes.  </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Secondly, our </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">teaching force is insufficiently expert to tackle the problems of learning and motivation experienced by most deprived children.  The one year PGCE, although better than nothing, is not a sufficient guarantor of the level of expertise needed.  We should lo</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">ok to adopt the Finnish model</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, in which not only are teachers very highly educated but are then subject to a rigorous selection process, followed by a minimum of three years post-graduate training, with regular occasions for further professional developmen</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">t.  Thirdly, we should introduce financial instruments which make a seriously significant contribution to reducing the material inequality from which deprived children suffer.  Universally provided free school meals (another Finnish idea) would be a start.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">  The Pupil Premium, although a good idea, is simply too small to make a significant difference.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">iv)</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> The success of Finnish education reminds us that an aspect of schooling which is regularly ignored in current educational discourse is that of the prestige</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> and status which adheres to a school and, therefore, to its pupils.  Britain is a deeply unequal society in which the activities of the rich carry high status and prestige, while those of the poor are largely despised.  </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Unfortunately, this also applies to</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> the schools which are attended by different sections of society.  The existence of a powerful independent sector, together with the emphasis placed upon “parental choice” within the state system by successive governments has created a hierarchy among our </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">schools.  Those schools at the top of the hierarchy are able to exercise considerable influence over admissions and, in effect, choose their pupils.  Those at the bottom are obliged to take the children that</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> the more advantaged schools do not want.  Very m</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">any deprived children already suffer from low morale and low self-esteem and their motivation to succeed at school is not helped by their acute awareness that they attend a school which reinforces their lowly status.  The converse is equally true for child</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">ren who attend a school with high status.  Unfortunately, the continuing development of the academy programme is likely to aggravate, rather than ameliorate this problem, as academies become responsible for their own admissions.  It is to be hoped that the</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Committee will take note that a common characteristic of the world’s most successful education systems is the relative absence of a hierarchy of schools. </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">v) All this having been said</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, rather than focus upon the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt;
