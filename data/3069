Welcome to the first session of our inquiry on women in STEM careers. We are not trying to reinvent the wheel in this inquiry. An awful lot has been written and many reports have been published over the years, but there is still a substantial problem, so we are trying to filter out the best of what has been said in the past and focus on some actions that perhaps might improve the situation, unless somebody comes up with a brilliant new idea that has not been thought of. I would be grateful if, just for the record, you would introduce yourselves.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jenny Marsden</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I am Jenny Marsden, and I am principal physicist at Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Patron</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">am</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Nicola Patron, head of synthetic biology at the Sainsbury Laboratory in Norwich.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Jones</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I am Bryn Jones.

I </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">went</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> to a state comprehensive, but it was a girls’ state comprehensive, which may also have influenced my feeling that I could achieve in science, because there were no boys in the school anyway. I went to sixth form where I studied physics. While there I chose to self-study a module in medical physics. I thought that was great; you could choose to use science in the medical arena, helping and caring for people but actually being a scientist. I thought that was fabulous, and from when I was 17 I have always wanted to do what I am doing now.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Patron</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I don’t think I knew what I </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">wanted</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> to do until I started as an undergraduate.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q3 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> But you did science at A-level.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Patron</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes, I did science at A-level, and mathematics, and at my university I had the opportunity to do an undergraduate project in a laboratory. While I was there the excitement of discovering new things that nobody else had understood before was irresistible, and that was when I decided that I wanted to have a career in research.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Jones</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I developed an interest in science when at school. I was very keen to study science at university. Although I found the university first degree interesting, I wanted a closer involvement in science and I chose to do a PhD.

Would you like to elaborate?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Jones</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The system in this country, and probably across the western world generally, is that we train considerable numbers of people to PhD standard through studentships for postgraduate research from research councils. The number of those is much greater than the number of research assistant posts. That is not itself such a bad thing, because many people choose to leave academic research—academia—after completing a PhD. There is also an imbalance in the number of research assistant posts compared with the number of fellowships, and then with the number of long-term, that is to say permanent, positions in academia. Most of the long-term permanent positions in academia are university </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">lecturerships</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, readerships and professorships. They are permanent academic posts. We train a very large number of people to PhD standard. There is a much smaller number of research assistant posts. That is not itself such an issue, but the number of permanent positions is very small, so there is a pyramid structure.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q9 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You would like that reversed.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Jones</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: No. I am a supporter of the pyramid structure, but I want something that is more vertical than the pyramid we have now. The problem is that the imbalance is too severe. In my old field of astronomy—my own research field—I estimate that there are about 15 times more people trained to PhD standard than there are long-term, that is to say permanent, university positions available. Perhaps only one in three people trained to PhD standard will choose to stay in academic research, but that still means there is something like a five-to-one </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">imbalance in the number of people who embark on a research career in universities and the number of people who can stay on in the long term.

That time cannot be gained back if it is at a crucial stage of someone’s career, or it is a crucial change in the environment you are working in—reorganisation times and things like that. There is also a bias towards </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">presenteeism</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in the workplace. I disagree with that, because you can do some work outside hours remotely—some, not all—and there is no reason why some people could not flex their day, do some hours in the office, some hours of research and then some outside, maybe when the children are in bed or caring responsibilities are over.

Say you could plan everything so well that you came to the end of your two-year contract and published your research and then you were funded for a particular period of time to have your family. Any sorts of barriers would then be removed, which would acknowledge the fact that there was a time when you did not do research and did not publish. Then you could compete for another contract. Is that the sort of thing you are saying would have to happen to enable women who want to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">to</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> have a family and continue in research?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Patron</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There is that option.

If they have a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">postdoc</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> on a two-year contract who takes maternity leave, what happens to their project? Their career is also being affected because someone in their laboratory is having a child. I certainly would not say that I have ever experienced a situation where people do not want to employ you because you are a woman of child-bearing age, but I am sure that people worry about it, because their own career would be affected. If they are on a tenure track and do not manage to publish what they need to, everyone’s career is affected.

Jenny, moving on to what you said, you are now working in the NHS, which is a different environment. You were talking about flexible working as a very good tool to enable both men and women to continue work and manage their caring responsibilities, whether for an elderly parent or children. I completely agree with you, but how much is that perceived to be a good thing in your experience? Do people readily welcome that, or do you have to fight for it within, say, the area of the NHS where you are employed?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jenny Marsden</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There is a difference between policy and enacting policy. There is a flexible working policy for most workplaces, but the enacting of the policy is a problem, especially in senior roles. This Committee is looking into women in STEM. The problem is that, as you become more senior, the idea of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">presenteeism</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—“You need to be there”—is even greater. I have been told in the past that someone would never consider a physicist being allowed to go part time, for example; I work full time. It has to meet the needs of the service, and it is the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">worker’s responsibility to prepare their case to show how it will not affect the service—to find a friend to do a job share or work out their annualised hours—or how it will benefit the workplace, not just the individual. In my experience, the higher you go the harder it is to prepare those cases; you get more specialised so there are fewer people to share the work load with. It is an unfortunate circle. The ridiculousness of the situation is that once you are in that senior post—if you can get in there—you have more autonomy over your work load, so you can choose. You can say, “I’m going to come in an hour late because I’ll just do that this evening.” Once a woman or man is in that role there is more space to work flexibly, but I do not know whether any woman or man looking at a job would ask, “Is this senior job open to part-time or flexible working?” because they may be criticised for asking it at that stage. It may show, wrongly, that they are not committed to that role.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q21 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sarah Newton:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You are quite right.

I referred in my written evidence to advertising senior roles as flexible, part-time higher grades. As long as the work is completed, there should not be any problem about when it is done, surely. If we can get women to interview, which is another question in itself, there is the option for having someone on the interview panel with experience of successful flexible working policies. You cannot help but put your own bias when you are interviewing someone for a post that is similar to yours; it is very difficult to remove yourself from that. Having someone who has successfully worked flexibly, or worked part time, for part of their career, would really help to encourage more people into senior roles in STEM where they may wish to consider working flexibly and part time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q23 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sarah Newton:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Role models.

The organisations could also report on the number of senior staff who take up flexible working. I know that in the NHS there is a lot of part-time working in lower grades. In NHS trusts generally, about 80% are women, or something ridiculous like that, but if you look at the published equality and diversity statistics for all the trusts by grade, you see the number of women go to something like nothing in the senior grades. There is no representation for engineers, scientists, policymakers and those making management decisions in STEM at that point.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q24 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Stephen Mosley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Dr Patron, in your evidence there is a lot of talk about the international nature of scientific research.

Hardly anybody will get a postdoctoral contract renewed in the same institute; it very rarely happens. If you are looking for a new job, mostly you are moving to a different university. That will inevitably be in a different city. If you want to be successful in science, you need to have a record of attracting funding independently, to yourself. The way this happens most usually is that younger scientists will apply for fellowships. For most of the fellowships in Europe the rules, at least in the life sciences—I cannot comment on those for physics because I do not know about them, but I believe they are similar for chemistry—require that to be eligible you have to move to a country different from the one where you were born, different from the one where you did your PhD and, in many cases, as I think I put in my written evidence, a country in which you have not done any previous work. In order to build a successful career you have to move countries—frequently.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q25 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Stephen Mosley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Why would they put in that specification?

For example, at the stage when medical careers are most competitive you are a little bit younger, so you can do all your competing; you can have a job and then decide. You have a good job and a stable career; you have already been successful, so you can decide to take maternity leave, have a family and come back, or not, because you are established. But in science you are establishing yourself between the ages of 25 and 35. Therefore, career breaks in that period are extremely disruptive for your career. That is the difference.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jenny Marsden</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I agree but I also disagree.

Ms Marsden, you referred to a huge lack of women in science. That is true across STEM generally, but in some areas not others. I accept what you said earlier about grading. It is not just a question of volume; it is a question of quality as well as quantity. Medical schools, for example, have been producing a majority of women graduates for the past few years, and that has certainly been true for veterinary medicine for even longer. What happens, given the fact that it starts off with broadly comparable numbers, so that, as careers develop and the management structure increases, women do not appear in anything like the same volume?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jenny Marsden</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We still have a bit of a lag from the fact that women are only just getting into these careers, so age is an issue at the moment. I am hoping that in 20 years’ time it will look a bit better. We are still recovering from the lag of women going into science subjects: medicine, veterinary medicine and all these things. There is still the cultural belief that women are somehow the main carers. I am at pains to suggest that this is not just children but, in the next few years, it will be parents and other people as well. The gender pay gap also influences that. For example, you spoke about maternity leave. Maternity leave and maternity pay are based on your rate of pay, normally. If a woman is paid less than a man, it makes sense in a partnership, for example, for the man to continue working and the woman to surrender her pay and have maternity pay as a proportion of that. The gender pay bias also affects the problem in the choices couples make when they decide to have a family.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q30 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jim Dowd:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Clearly, there is bias against women in science and STEM more generally.

A problem I experienced in astronomy was that research council practice often prevented me, as someone on fixed-term contracts, from taking initiatives. For example, I could not apply for the kind of grants Dr Patron was talking about; I was forbidden to do it. I could not apply for fellowships of my own choosing but had to have approval from a department. More recently, there have been quite tight restrictions on the number of fellowship applications that departments can put forward. There was a strong need for me to get approval or support from established academics. Sometimes they gave that. Some departments were excellent, but others did not give it. When you do not get it you do not know why. You do not know whether it is because you are not considered good enough, or that you are good enough but another candidate is preferred for the fellowship application, for example. I am conscious that there is a danger of unconscious bias in favour of loud men who are confident.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jenny Marsden</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I read that in your evidence, and I completely agree.

That raises issues about unconscious bias. For example, as a man I wanted to apply for what was then an advanced fellowship that had been repackaged under another name, but I did not have the support of departments to do that. Only one department I worked in supported fellowship applications. At that time they were unsuccessful. Perhaps it was a bit early in my career, but later there were departments where I could apply for fellowships but did not have the support of those departments.

I do not know how we can fix that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Patron</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: One of the ways to fix it is for there to be better role models. Children look at who they are going to be and say, “I can be like that person; I can identify with that person. That’s something I can do,” but, if I go to an international conference and look at the plenary speakers, none of them will be like me. It is very hard to see a route for my career to reach that point, when I have nothing in common with those people.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jenny Marsden</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: And the people who do succeed do it regardless; they do not have any boundaries to their perceptions.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q36 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Stephen Metcalfe:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You are painting quite a bleak picture of what it is like to be a scientist, full stop.

Having said that, I have had friends in laboratories who describe exactly that situation, particularly immunologists. I have three friends who are immunologists. That is how they describe their career to me. It is an extremely competitive field, and quite an exciting field.

You accept, therefore, that there is a cultural problem. Someone described it as a sink-or-swim culture. You have to get on, do it yourself and drive yourself forward. I think you used some of those words yourself. Is that culture being perpetuated by those who have gone through it, and because they feel they have earned their spurs they want to pass it on to the next generation, who have to achieve in the same way as they did, as opposed perhaps to moving towards a more teamwork-based culture?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Patron</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is, but the whole system of competing for funding brings out the competitive nature. All the science councils release a competitive funding round. That is what it is called.  It is a competition. We are a set of scientists competing for a small amount of money. It is competitive; it is silly to pretend that it is not. Then you have to publish. You are competing to complete your experiments before the other laboratory completes theirs and publishes first; otherwise, you are scooped and you cannot publish, and then you have wasted all that money and all of your career. It is competitive.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jenny Marsden</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The ownership of projects and of papers is quite a divisive thing.

Recently, the laboratory that I worked in received funding to tackle ash dieback, which you will have heard about because it was in the news quite extensively. They decided to do this on an open research platform. They have done a lot of genome sequencing and released it on the web. They said, “We need to tackle this disease. Any laboratory that would like to work on this and contribute, please do so and contact us. We are just acknowledging each other in what goes forward.” It has been tremendously successful, and it would be great if more projects worked like that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Jones</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There are perhaps two types of competition: positive competition, which drives up standards and is very strong in science, with different groups and different researchers competing against each other to be first to publish and get good results. There is also negative competition, where there is too much competition and those who do not succeed are defeated and almost destroyed by the system. When it comes to the career system, there is too much negative competition. There are too few prizes and too many failures; and there are also too many really good people who are destined to fail because the career system is overly competitive.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q38 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Stephen Metcalfe:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I understand the positive side of laboratory competing against laboratory in bidding for money. What concerns me is the culture, perhaps within laboratories themselves, about putting in hours and so on and that being perpetuated. Most PhD students require some form of mentoring and someone to work with. Are those mentors perpetuating that type of culture, or is there more they can do to try to improve the situation? Is there a bias towards a more masculine, male approach rather than a female, feminine approach?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jenny Marsden</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think there is.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Jones</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes, there can be. Different people respond differently and behave differently. Some people may be very supportive of others; some people may be aggressively competitive and expect others to be aggressively competitive, so it depends on the individual, but there are some problem areas and there is some macho culture. I was in one group that had a very strong macho culture. I did not fit into it; I am not that kind of person. It was not one based on fair competition; in that particular research group it was survival of the fittest under any circumstances. It does vary.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q39 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Stephen Metcalfe:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Taking all those comments together, what can we do that may start to shift the cultural balance away from that masculine approach to something that is perhaps more in tune with where the rest of industry might have moved to?

I do not know the answers, but those are some of the areas we might like to explore.

For example, there is the concordat on research careers. There is very little understanding of that among some academics, so human resources departments could raise awareness of that and of good practice. Just getting human resources departments to explain to academics that these principles apply could be very helpful.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jenny Marsden</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We need believable role models as well. I agree that we need role models, but I have not always found them particularly helpful. If you look at the world of business, key female role models all seem to be super-women with nannies, au pairs and cleaners. That is something I do not relate to when I am up at 5 in the morning with my child. I do not know how you would be able to do this. You need to promote the personal as well as the professional benefits of a career. We are now going to be working for a long time, so nine months out once or twice in the entire 45 years is a very small time. Maybe we can also look at bringing women back into science, where they feel that is appropriate. There is no reason why they should be lost forever if they have decided to have a long career break, apart from </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">the question of how to get into research if you have to change jobs every two years. That would support the argument for having five-year or longer research-type funding.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Jones</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Some research councils are moving towards not five years but a consolidated grant approach, which is three years with a decision about continuity.

It is because they have had a family member or friend who was a role model in science, man or woman. The more that women come out of science when they have children, the more it is perpetuating that. We need to keep those mothers, and fathers, in those science careers so they can demonstrate how great and interesting these areas are—how you are at the forefront, doing exciting things and helping people. The dieback stuff is really interesting. Lots of children are interested in natural history, and it is very important that we have local accessible role models.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q41 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">David </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tredinnick</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Building on the question about role models, you have already said that some of the people out there are super-humans with a whole string of support services—and presumably they are amazing and able to manage their time better than everybody else—but I put it to you: are both of you not role models?

I would love to aspire to be that, but to think that the only way you can succeed is to be the absolute best is going to put off a lot of people.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jenny Marsden</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: When children are young we excite them with science. We say it is going to be great; we’re going to do some really cool things in laboratories. We’re going to be able to play with test tubes—whizz-bang pops, lots of colours—and look at the stars, think about mechanics, and things like that. Once you sell science to these people and they do their undergraduate degrees and go on, the reality is that in the workplace it is still going to be difficult. It may not be what they expected. Perhaps it does not bring the rewards they thought it would, both financially and in doing the work and having the personal gratification of finding out things, especially when someone publishes it a month before you do. It is difficult. They are sold something that may not be entirely true, so that is probably why we are losing some as well.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q47 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">David </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tredinnick</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you think many women would not really welcome becoming a role model because such activities could be detrimental to their career, or could be an additional burden or not be properly recognised or rewarded?

One of them is in Aberdeen and the other in Portsmouth because there are limited numbers of places where they can do their work. But science is about excellence, isn’t it, and making sure that the best get to the top? This inquiry is about trying to find out whether some of the best are lost on the way, particularly women who could be doing really great things in more senior posts. One of the sadder things I heard Dr Jones say is that if people leave science that is in some way a failure. Surely, a lot of those people, having got those skills, go on to be very successful in other fields. Perhaps you could tell me a little about your experience of colleagues who have left science, what they have gone on to do and whether they are successful in that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Jones</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Perhaps I should answer that because I have left science. I reached the end of the career and dropped out. I have not been able to find another career yet; I am still searching. It is difficult to comment on what people do. I know more about what happens when people leave after PhDs. In astrophysics they tend to go into things like computing and teaching. I can identify certain things they can do at that level.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It is much more difficult to say where people go after they leave a research career—that is to say, they work as research assistants, fail to get permanent jobs and they are out. There are fewer career options for those of us like me in that position. I was talking about this to Dr Patron before the session began. We do not know the destinations of so many people who leave research.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Patron</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I have just come back to the UK after working in Canada and Australia for the last 10 years. On coming back, it was quite natural for me to try to reconnect with all the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">people who were my peers when I was working here. It has been quite easy to connect with people who are in research. People who have left research will not return my calls. They are completely destroyed. They are failed and destroyed; they will not speak to people who are still in research. It is heartbreaking to put so much into a career and to reach your late 30s, late 40s even, and be unemployed, and in some cases unemployable, because being a scientist does not train you to do a whole lot else.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jenny Marsden</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: That is very sad.

It trains you to do all sorts of things that maybe you are not aware of. The careers training in this country is quite poor. When you are 15 you do not realise how many different job possibilities there are and what sort of skills you need.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q49 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> As a Labour M</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">ember it is not normal for me to say this, but Margaret Thatcher did not do badly.

The trouble is that she did it comparatively early. She did not do a PhD. She had a few years in industrial chemistry and then left. It becomes very difficult for those like me who persist with an academic career and achieve some success but are then forced to leave because there are insufficient jobs for us in academia. What do we do? We face prejudice from employers.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jenny Marsden</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Are we </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">mis</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">-selling the academic route?

Very few group leaders and PhD supervisors encourage careers. There was a paper in the United States not so long ago which said that, even though only 30% of PhD graduates would have a career in academia, 80% think they are going to have a career in academia; and 95% had only been spoken to about careers in academia, so they are not preparing themselves for other careers.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jenny Marsden</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: So we are selling it wrongly.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Patron</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Absolutely.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q50 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Roger Williams:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You are telling me that people who leave academia, particularly women who leave academic careers, are being pushed out, rather than being pulled out by very attractive options outside what they thought would be their career.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jenny Marsden</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I raised this in my written submission. We ought to have better connections with companies and people looking for top-quality science graduates and science PhD students. There ought to be more joined-up thinking by companies, and they should sell it by saying they offer good flexible working practice and join up with PhDs better, because we are losing so much quality.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Jones</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Could I interject? I am looking for a new career. I am absolutely convinced that I could be brilliant at many things, but I am just not going to get the opportunity, because employers out there fear that people with PhDs will be more expensive to employ and will expect higher salaries. That is not the case. They expect that people with PhDs employed in a company at a lower, or perhaps normal, salary will do the job for a year and then disappear off to a better-paying company elsewhere. They think we expect a premium because of our PhDs and research experience, which is not necessarily the case.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There are also fears among employers that people with specific experience in research are not adaptable. That is the exact opposite of what is true. If you work at a high level in research in science you have to be adaptable, but employers do not understand that. Employers out there simply do not understand in any detail what high-performing scientists are capable of doing. That is a major problem in transferring, but we need vastly improved careers advice to help those of us who have left the academic system to find new jobs.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jenny Marsden</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There are many careers now.
