If you are looking at things like, for example, the rolling out of the student loans policy, pension age changes and so on, then to do that over a couple of generations will pick up quite a lot of those sorts of changes.

You have obviously to deal with the data that you have available to make those adjustments for, so I think we were raising the general point that if you have a lower productivity in this sector and you want output to rise at the rate that it does elsewhere, then that would require more.

In part, I think it is helpful to see how particular individual policy change—you may be uncertain about what the central projection is, but does a particular policy change move you in a more or less favourable direction from that central expectation in terms of a policy decision? If you are making a change in terms of pension policy or student financial support, is that likely to push you in a more or less favourable direction? I think it can also be useful in terms of setting medium-term fiscal plans into a broader context. You might take a different view of a medium-term fiscal consolidation programme if you thought that, in the longer term, you were likely to have to continue to go in the same direction for other reasons not related to filling a particular hole in the public finances or that things were going back in another direction. The Government, presumably, looks at the current fiscal consolidation in the context of there being broader, longer-term pressures in this sort of area.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q19 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Stewart Hosie:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> In that sense, then, this might be a useful tool for fine-tuning?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert Chote</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I would say less for fine-tuning than taking a broad-brush look at the major influences. Do you see the major upward pressures on public expenditure coming in health versus pensions, for example? Those sorts of issues. It also, I think, can help in thinking about how you want to design your fiscal rules. We have had a shock in which public sector debt has moved a long way away from the previous path. It might be quite helpful to look at different ways in which you might expect public sector net debt to evolve over relatively long periods to decide how you want to frame your rules for the medium term, as there might be some longer-term path that you wish to get closer to.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q20 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Stewart Hosie:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> With the caveat, as the Chairman has said, that if health spending, as an example, changes by a percentage point or so, it can have a significant change on the outcome in terms of debt.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert Chote</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Absolutely right. The sensitivity on health is an interesting example in comparison to most of the other sensitivities in here, where we are talking about economic phenomena that could turn out differently, productivity growth and so on. The sensitivity on health is, in a sense, a sensitivity around the fact that there are different ways of interpreting what you mean by the continuation of current policy. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The approach we take in our central projections is essentially to assume that expenditure on public services is held constant as a share of GDP for people of a particular age. We do not go into greater granularity than that, with the exception of looking at this issue of health, which a number of other reports such as this in other countries have done, but the point is that if you were to go into a situation where you accommodated greater spending on that area because you wanted to adjust for productivity, that in a sense is a policy choice, rather than the fact that productivity growth has turned out differently, which may or may not be arising from policy. The health one is a slightly unusual sensitivity test relative to the others in many ways.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q21 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Stewart Hosie:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> To what extent do you think Government, and other policy makers, pay attention to this report and others in terms of the development of what they intend to do when they are making public policy decisions?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert Chote</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think they do. As always, policy makers know that we will be producing this report and that we will be looking at the potential impact that these things have, so I am sure that when they are considering policy as regards pension age, for example, they would take that into account. If you look at the policy towards student financial support, again, this is a way of demonstrating that if you have an income-contingent loan system, then you are going to see this pushing up public sector net debt, all other things being equal, and then it will start to come down again as the repayments flow in. In those sorts of design issues, this is something that Governments do, and sensibly do, take account of.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q22 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Stewart Hosie:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You gave the Chancellor a draft copy of this report to allow him to decide whether he wanted to incorporate other policy changes into your numbers, and he declined to do so.

Essentially speaking, this is a familiar finding across most of these reports, and it is related to the relative age distribution of net inward migrants versus the population as a whole. Essentially speaking, inward migrants are more likely to be of working age than the population in general, so, as it were, they leave after some other country has picked up more of the expense of educating them, and in some cases—not all cases—they will then leave the country again before you get to the point at which they are most expensive in terms of pension and healthcare and long-term care provision.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q25 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr McFadden:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So, we get them at their most productive years?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert Chote</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: In terms of the fiscal position, that is what drives the fact that higher net inward migration over this time horizon does tend to produce a more beneficial picture, yes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q26 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr McFadden:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Are they more likely to work or to claim benefits?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert Chote</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We are making overall assumptions that, effectively, employment rates are not changed here, so the assumption is that the net inward migration population is pretty similar to the native population.

In terms of what they call their principal projection, it is a fairly mechanical extrapolation of the sorts of levels of net inward migration that you have seen in relatively recent years. In the case of this report, we have had a subsequent set of population projections out since then. The principal variant is about </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">200,000 a</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> year net inward migrants, based on what you have seen in relatively recent years.

The </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Huffington</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Post</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> suggested in July 2013 that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Britain</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> needs 7 million migrants over the next 50 years in order to keep down national debt levels because of, as you have rightly pointed out, the ageing population and the increased costs that that implies. In your forecasting, you have taken the lower values for migration. Have you done or could you do more sensitivity analysis to reflect the potential impact of different Government policies on those central figures? Obviously, forecasting out to 2062 is, “How long is a piece of string?” You must feel slightly in outer space when you are forecasting out that far, and anything can happen, and a lot depends on issues like migration policy and whether we suddenly create some new virus that means that the ageing population do not age quite so well. Anything can happen. I am not forecasting that, but it is impossible to project that far out. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:35.45pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In terms of migration, which does have a material impact potentially on the revenue side if we get young workers in, have you done or can you do more sensitivity analysis on the extent to which the inaccuracy—not to be rude, but inevitable—of your forecasts could mean that you are totally wrong by an order of an enormous amount if the migration numbers are larger than expected?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert Chote</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes. What we have done in addition to the ones that we have mentioned in discussion with Mr McFadden—and we do the projections for the principal variant, the high migration variant, the low migration variant, the zero variant and the effectively zero gross, so you have quite a range there. Unfortunately, none of those is the high tens of thousands, so there is a question, when we do the next one, as now we know from the ONS that they are in a position to produce that if we want to do that, that that is the one we could add. In terms of the options that are here now, you can see quite a degree of the scale of the variation that is implied by those sensitivities, and it does make quite a lot of difference, not surprisingly.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrea Leadsom:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert Chote</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Could I just come back?

I do not know whether that was their view or they were attributing that to us. The fact that we have chosen 140,000 does not imply that that is our preferred level of net inward migration. That is not something on which we would have a view at all. Clearly, if you made a choice on migration or you made an assumption on migration that made the fiscal position look better or worse, then you could adjust other policies to compensate for that, so there is no level of net inward migration you have to have for there to be fiscal sustainability. It is one influence on a whole variety of other choices Government has to make.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Nickell</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: If you look at page 147, you will see the picture that shows how debt moves at different levels of migration. As I said before, in some sense, if you want to get another number—central is 140,000, high is 260,000, zero is zero—you can just imagine how a curve in between might go, and I doubt you would be very far wrong.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q34 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrea Leadsom:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The point that I think you are confirming is that you would change dramatically the central forecast that you have put out here, depending on what sort of migration policy you have, and of course I am sure—it is not something that we talk about a whole lot—if suddenly our ageing population decided a life in the south of Spain looked very nice to them, equally, if you removed a lot of the state dependency of the ageing population, you would have the same impact. Would that be a fair assumption?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert Chote</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes, and it is worth reinforcing the point that these are different scenarios for net inward migration. Government policy is effectively confined to restrictions on particular categories of inward migration. One of the reasons why this is not a policy parameter but a policy objective and it is not under the direct control is that there is not a policy parameter that controls this number in aggregate. You are controlling some inward migration and, as you can say, there could be different trends, for example, in outward migration that would change those numbers whatever Government policy was doing, because Government policy does not currently extend to saying whether people can or cannot leave the country.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q35 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrea Leadsom:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Again for clarity, presumably you are also expecting that the net result of whatever your immigration policy would be is that, unless you then sustain it for ever and ever and ever, there comes a time when your immigrants become old and therefore add to the ageing population, unless you have an assumption about birth rates and a permanent new source of fresh young people to pay for their ageing. Can you explore that momentarily?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert Chote</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes. This is one of the reasons why in the report we are careful to say that we draw these conclusions over this particular time horizon, and clearly, over a longer time horizon, some of those issues start to arise. That said, those things are not ignored entirely because of the way in which the ONS is doing the population projections. They are taking into account the fact that some proportion stay and some proportion don’t in terms of the way in which the population projection moves, but, as we say, we are careful in saying that this is a story that holds over this particular time horizon, and if you were to go over a longer time horizon the picture could be different.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q36 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrea Leadsom:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I guess you make no assumptions about the proposition that particularly EU migrants come to this country to earn a few bob and then go home and settle at home, thereby conveniently removing the need for us to support them in old age, so you do not build that in at all to your projections, I guess.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert Chote</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: No, except that those sorts of factors will be taken into account in the way in which the ONS is doing the overall projections.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q37 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrea Leadsom:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So that would be featured in here? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Nickell</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes.

If net migration is the difference between immigration and emigration, then net migration of older people would simply reflect the fact that not many people migrate to another country in old age, or possibly that more people retire in the south of Spain than retire in the south of windy wherever in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England. Are the ONS figures looking at age groups or the performance of migrants over time? In other words, if I am 26 and I am an Eastern European who comes to the UK to work, how do I feature in the ONS figures when I am 46 and I go home—back to wherever I came from originally—to settle there? How is that reflected?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Nickell</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: They just look at the static picture. They obviously have to make assumptions when they are projecting forward. The sort of assumptions they make are that in some sense the behaviour that we observe now from immigrants who have come in the past is that they are more likely to leave when they get older than natives are, and they say, “This is how the behaviour has been over the past, and we will assume that similar sorts of behaviour will happen in the future.” We have had EU migration into this country for many, many years, so we do have some history of what happens to them as they get older and what proportion of them leave. Then they will make assumptions, saying that this will continue into the future. It is not very sophisticated in the sense that they say, “Oh, look, some people come from </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Poland</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and they are different from people who come from some other country”. It is relatively mechanistic, just as their assumptions about migration are basically based on the last few years, which is why every time they do new projections the migration assumptions change, because what has happened in the last few years has changed.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q39 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrea Leadsom:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> But even though there is, as we know, a marked tendency for migrants to come here to work, then go home to retire, that is taken into account in showing the ageing population. That phenomenon is reflected, and the impact of the ageing population on the cost of running our economy is taken into account, the fact that a lot of them will go back to where they came from. It is not assumed that they will retire here. Can you just confirm that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Nickell</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: No, it is not assumed—I mean, it is assumed that their returning habits continue to be what they are like now.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q40 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Ruffley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Mr Chote, the reporting of these immigration statements, your sensitivity analysis shows that overall migration has a positive impact on the sustainability of the public finances. Can you just take us through how </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">140,000 a</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> year net migration contributes to the public finances? There is an argument, is there not, that we are not taking into account the use of public services, of nursery school places, GP surgeries, hospital places and so on and so on? Can you just explain this general proposition that net immigration into this country is a good thing and where the evidence for this comes from?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert Chote</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It boils back down to this issue about the fact they are more likely to be of working age than other people. We are assuming that the net inward migrants have roughly the same productivity as the native population. One consequence of having net inward migration is that GDP is higher as a consequence of the economic activity that these people are doing, helped by the fact that many of them will be of working age. As we mentioned earlier, we assumed that public expenditure in most areas of public services is constant as a share of GDP per person, adjusted for their age. We are assuming that there will be a higher real spending on things like schools and hospitals and houses and state support for housing as a result of net inward migration because GDP goes up, and we assume that the public expenditure in those sorts of areas goes up in line with GDP, so there is more real public spending going on as a consequence of net inward migrants who contribute to GDP, so it is not as though you are not taking into account the impact that that has on public services. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There is obviously a whole different question about whether that spending is taking place in the right places in the country and whether there are strains there; it is not within our remit to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">look at that. As I say, because they are more likely to be of working age, they are more likely to be paying taxes and less likely to be having relatively large sums of money spent on them for education, for long-term care, for healthcare and for pension expenditure, which is taken into account by looking at this at a representative age level. Those are the main effects that are generating the contribution. You are getting more tax revenue and relatively little spending. There is more real spending going on in contributing to public services because GDP is higher.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q41 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Ruffley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> There have been two recent University College London analyses on the amount of tax paid compared with the benefits received by immigrants. Do you broadly agree with those pieces of work? They have been very prominent in the newspapers. They are prayed in aid regularly as demonstrating that net migration, immigration, is a good thing. Do you basically agree? Perhaps I could ask Professor Nickell that question because I know he has expertise in this area.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Nickell</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think the way they work that sort of thing out is very similar to the way we work things out, in the sense that we always think of things as age-specific, so if migrants have a different age structure to the population, which is more in the working age and less at the outer reaches, then that will automatically mean that they are more likely to pay more in tax than they get in benefits. So the answer to your question, fundamentally, is yes, I think that we would agree with what these other studies say.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q42 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Ruffley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Just two final, very quick questions.

The other one is to basically take, as I say, the area where this is most quantitatively significant as your assumption about the uprating of tax receipts and allowances on the revenue side and of benefits—social security payments—on the other side, where the conventional—something counts as a policy change if you are doing this by a different number from inflation. It is not necessarily saying that that is the policy, but that is the accounting treatment of when something will appear in the Red Book as being a policy measure or not. It is not a very sensible way of defining unchanged policy over a very long term because it simply implies, because of real income growth, that you have the average tax rate rising and rising and rising and the relative generosity of benefits moving in the opposite direction. It is a more neutral assumption and one that, indeed, the Treasury was making in its version of this report long before we were, accepting that that was not realistic long term.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q67 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Teresa Pearce:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Following on from what has just been discussed about the public sector net debt deficit, from the National Accounts and the Whole of Government Accounts, you look at what has happened in the past to try to work out what is going to happen in the future.

Steve will have more views on that. Given these are the ONS’s official population projections, I think that they are the best we have to go on, and it is not worth us trying to second-guess that and come up with different ones. It is a relatively complicated process to come up with the projections in the degree of disaggregation which they do and which you require for the sorts of modelling analysis that underpins reports like these. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q77 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mark Garnier:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It is incredibly important. What I want to concentrate on is the population growth. We have heard a lot about the immigration numbers, but if we are looking forward 50 years, you have to be pretty convinced that the methodology, on which you are using the basic numbers, is something that you agree with. I am just curious if you guys have spent any time looking at it to make sure that—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Nickell</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Their kind of methodology is they look at recent history. They look at the recent history of fertility rates and migration, and then their projections assume that that recent history will carry on. What that means, of course, is that 50-year population projections will move enormously from one year to the next or from one decade to the next as fertility rates change. For example, if you look back at population projections during the time of the post-war baby boom, the population projection was for an enormous rise in the population because fertility rates at that time were very high, and then they came down. In other words, in their methodology they made no serious attempt to forecast how fertility rates might change over the future, and you can understand why they did that, because in some sense they would argue, I suspect, “Well, we just look at the facts and we say, ‘Here is what has happened recently. What would happen if that carried on? Those are our projections’”.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q78 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mark Garnier:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> That is basically it. “If what is happening today carries on another 50 years, this is the end result.”</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Nickell</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q79 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mark Garnier:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Whatever the trajectory is now is continued, rather than a change of trajectory. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Nickell</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Exactly.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert Chote</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: But as you have seen from the report, they are producing lots of variants around that central view to capture the alternatives of what happens if the fertility rate is higher or lower or the mortality rates and so on—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q80 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mark Garnier:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes.

We don’t look at those sorts of feedbacks. Again, Steve is more the expert on this than I am. There are some bits of future population projections that you can be more confident about than others. You can be fairly confident about the consequences of the baby boom generation moving through the age structure. Movements in fertility rates and mortality rates are slightly more uncertain, I would presume, partly because they will be affected by things like migration, so there will be some bits of it that you can be more confident of than others, but we have not tried to do what you have described as well. In a sense, that will be a comparison of different policy alternatives, but basically saying, “A higher level of health spending per head would have the following consequences for the age at which people die.” I think that would be going somewhat beyond our expertise.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q81 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mark Garnier:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> May I talk about pensions?

If you move the expected productivity growth up or down, it does not make an enormous difference to the projections on spending and receipts. The primary reason for that is because you have wages linked to productivity. We are assuming that tax allowances and thresholds are linked to earnings over the longer term and the generosity of benefit payments is linked to earnings over time. Those things are reflecting what is going in on productivity growth. Clearly, if productivity growth is half a percentage point higher or lower, it matters an awful lot because we are going to be a lot richer or poorer; it does not matter because of the nature of the assumptions that we make about how the parameters of the tax system and the benefits system respond to the public finance projections. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Graham Parker</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We also relate other public service expenditure to GDP as well.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q85 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">John Thurso:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> May I tease out what I think you just said?

The naive assumption that I am making as a completely untrained economist is that if you were to run without a deficit or with a surplus for a period of time, you would accumulate wealth in the country. I am having difficulty understanding why, in 50 years’ time, if that policy was to be followed, we are going to end up with such a massive debt and deficit. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert Chote</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It comes back to this point of whether the assumption you make about constant policy is to increase spending over time.

The sorts of decisions that Governments have made over time as to by how much you should, for example, uprate the basic state pension—by prices or earnings or by the triple lock—have implications that can mount up over some quite considerable period of time.
