The very fact of reducing the Constitution to a set of written rules or principles is likely to lead to judges treating the text as legally enforceable. The obvious parallel is the current French Constitution </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">of October</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> 1958. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The French had an unwritten constitution during its longest lasting political regime, the Third Republic (1870-1940), and resisted the creation of a judicial body to enforce the rules of the Constitution until 1958. The French tradition, like the British, was to have politicians decide on constitutional issues. While the Fifth Republic Constitution</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> was being adopted, the author, Michel Debré, was asked whether the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Preamble to the 1946 Constitution would be legally enforceable. His reply in August 1958 was “Certainly not!” The Constitutional Council, however, decided that they were legally enforceable in a landmark decision of July 1971.</span><a name="_ftnref1"></a><a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> All the constitutional drafters managed to achieve was that the issue of whether a statute passed by Parliament was constitutional or not would be decided only by the Constitutional Council (deliberately not called a “court”) and not by the ordinary judges.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> The drafters restricted the power to refer cases to the Council to a limited number of office-holders, because they were concerned that “Every time that a statute has given rise to an impassioned debate, the opposition will not fail to refer it to the Constitutional Council, and in the end effective government will be in the hands of the pensioners who will sit in the Council.”</span><a name="_ftnref2"></a><a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> The reference power was extended to 60 members of Parliament in 1974 and it is</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> now</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> true that political opposition groups refer contested issues (police powers, same sex marriages, education reforms) to the Council on a very regular basis.

The key issue is whether the judges will be sufficiently respectful of the role of the Parliament in making policy decisions. </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The German experience has some similarities, but a key difference.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> Judicial review came out of the experience of dictatorship in which Parliament voted to support a government which seriously infringed fundamental rights. So the idea of constitutional review was designed around the mistrust of politicians. To a great extent, the constitutions of Spain and Italy also reflect this concern. So judicial control over the boundaries of the political process was part of the original</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> constitutional</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> design. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The Court’s</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> jurisdiction, set out in the law on the Constitutional Court (BVerfGG), includes not only the protection of fundamental rights, but the constitutionality of political parties (art. 21, para.2 GG), electoral issues relating to membership of Parliament (a jurisdiction which the French Constitutional Council also has), complaints against the President of the Republic, as well as conflicts between federal organs of state or concerning the relationship between the federation and the regions.  So, yes cases are brought</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">which are highly political.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Realistically, there is no way that the original intention of the constitutional codifiers about the role of the judiciary can be enshrined. The French experience is that this changed within the first 15 years, simply because the judges took a different view. The degree of intervention in Germany has also varied over time.

The certification of whether any bill has passed the appropriate stages is made by the Speaker. The creation of a codified constitution would lead to such issues becoming legally justiciable. In Germany, for example, the Constitutional Court faced a case in 2002 in which the votes for Brandenburg in the Bundesrat on a piece of legislation were contested. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">A regional government coalition diverged on how to vote on national immigration legislation.

First, what is the relationship between national constitutional statements of rights and the EU Charter and the European Convention?

This is called “abstract constitutional review” because the Court is seised of the whole text and considers it without any examples of how it might apply, but simply in the light of the observations of the referring parties and the Government.) This kind of review was adopted by the EU (with a similar strict time limit) for challenges by Member States, and was the only route the French provided in the 1958 Constitution. The German Constitution also provided for post-enactment review arising in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">specific cases in courts. The constitutional question arising in such cases is then referred to the Constitutional Court to be resolved before the ordinary court proceeds to decide the case on the facts. This procedure is the most common route in Germany and in the EU, and it was </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">copied by the French in 2008. British devolution legislation provides for both kinds of review. That was wise at the time and seems to cover the appropriate eventualities. First, parties in abstract review proceedings cannot always anticipate how the law will work in practice. Secondly, circumstances change and what might have seemed a right solution in the 1950s is no longer the case. The German have seen this on the issue of banning political parties. It made sense in the fragile conditions of the early 1950s to ban communist and neo-Nazi parties, but it has been seen as less appropriate in a more mature and confident democracy.
