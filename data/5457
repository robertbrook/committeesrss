The Mayor of London has described your report as “gloopy and tangled,” “perplexing and odd” and its recommendations as “to some extent severed from the evidence.” That does not sound much like consensus, does it?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Howard Davies</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: Well, he would say that, wouldn’t he? I completely dismiss what the Mayor has said about our report. It is completely at variance with what anyone else has said—transport correspondents, the airports themselves, other economists, etc. Unfortunately, as far as the Mayor is concerned, we do not seem to have produced the answer he wants us to produce. We will proceed with our analysis in the way we have been asked to do.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The Mayor has a particular view about hub capacity and a particular view about Heathrow. That is where he starts and that’s where he ends, and anything at variance with that is dismissed. Personally, I do not think it is at all helpful that he uses this rather colourful language, but I guess that is a matter of style. I do not think it particularly illuminates the debate to do so, but we will not react; we will simply press on, because there are some important issues to resolve about the future of demand for aviation in this country, and about the environmental and cost consequences of different solutions. Among those is an estuary option, on which we are doing further work. I will attempt to rise above this vulgar abuse and press on with the job.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q3 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Do you think these remarks are about trying to bring political pressure on you?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Howard Davies</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: I do not know. As I said, I think the Mayor began with a particular view about aviation demand and the solution to it, and therefore dismissed a lot of other options ab initio. He said you can’t do Heathrow and you can’t do Gatwick, and therefore any review that reopens those questions does not match what he sees as the answer. I am sure it is a genuinely held view on his part, but it is not a starting point for an independent review. You cannot begin by ruling out a lot of options without argument. Whether it is political pressure, I do not know; it is above my pay grade.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q4 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Karl McCartney:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Although, as chairman of the commission, you are independent, the Mayor of London perhaps has a democratic right to make his views known on behalf of constituents, whether or not they voted for him. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">London</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> is quite a big place, so he has quite a few voters.

We have always had very civil and often amusing meetings, and I will endeavour to carry on doing that. We certainly will maintain our connections with the Mayor’s office. I was slightly surprised</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">by this outburst over the weekend, given the tone of the meetings we have had up to now, including before the interim report, because we appeared to be dealing with each other in a very straightforward way, and I hope we can get back to that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q6 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Graham Stringer:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> In trying to get consensus, when the Secretary of State made his last statement to the House of Commons on your interim report, he accepted that it would be a good idea if all three parties accepted your final report recommendations as they went forward. Have you had discussions with the leaders of the three main parties along those lines? It seems to me important, whatever your final report says, that after 50 years of discussing it, it is not another report that gathers dust on a shelf.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Howard Davies</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: Yes. A slight grace note on my answer “yes” is that I had discussions with the party leaders when I began the work, part way through it and just before the interim report. I think it is a normal matter of courtesy to talk through what you are about to say. It is not for me to try to push them into saying that they will or will not agree with what I eventually come out with; I do not think that would be reasonable before we actually come out with it, but we attempted to maintain a parallel relationship with the leaders of the three parties—indeed, I think we succeeded. I hope Ed </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Miliband</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> and Nick Clegg would agree with that; we talked to them in advance of our publications and explained the rationale. We have been prepared to talk—to Mary </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Creagh</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, for example, quite often, and before her, Maria Eagle. We are attempting to build the basis for an eventual consensus.

I read the full report. Your analysis of the consequences of having an airport at the Isle of Grain is even more devastating than this Committee’s Report. We commissioned independent work on it and we ruled it out. You say that in order for it to go ahead you have to close three airports: one of the largest airports in the world, a major commercial airport and a </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">package</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> airport at Southend. Your median figure, when you put optimum bias into it, is a cost to the public sector of about £100</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">billion, and there is great uncertainty </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">about whether it would be allowed to go ahead anyway because of the environmental consequences. That really does seem to be a slam dunk. Why are you going ahead with more work on this?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Howard Davies</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: The arguments advanced for a new hub airport in the estuary are in some respects of a different character from the ones advanced for a third runway at Heathrow, or a second at Gatwick. In a sense, they are arguments of a shift in the economic geography of London and the south-east. The case is made that London’s population will grow by 1 million between now and 2030, and people will have to have somewhere to live and work; that the Thames Gateway area is going to be an area of expansion; that Heathrow itself could be a major area of housing expansion in the west if it were closed; and that a new airport would allow for a massive increase in aviation because it would allow 24</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">hour operation. There is a whole variety of arguments which are difficult to weigh up definitively against the arguments for expansion at the margins of other airports.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The environmental arguments are quite difficult to assess as well. On the one hand, some people say you would never get agreement to build an airport on locations where there are significant bird habitats; you would never get permission to do it. On the other hand, people say that you would as long as you provided compensatory habitats and no other options were realistically available, and that might be the case if you could demonstrate that the noise implications elsewhere would be completely unacceptable in the public interest.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Looking at all these arguments in the round, we had to ask ourselves: “Are we satisfied that our degree of certainty is enough either to rule this option in or rule it out?” In the end, after going round the houses—I accept it was the area on which the commission spent the most time in the weeks before our interim report—we decided that we did not have enough information to make a firm decision. Therefore, we decided to carry out studies on four areas, which themselves demonstrate the areas of uncertainty. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The first is on surface access, where the feasibility and cost of driving rail routes into the centre of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">London</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> from the estuary is something we think is crucial to the decision, and about which we are not certain enough at the moment. The second is what those environmental directives mean. It is quite difficult to look round </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> and find any comparable issues. You can find one or two cases in relation to ports, but there are only limited places where you can put a port and, therefore, to say there is no alternative location is an easier thing to do, whereas in principle you can put an airport on any flat ground. We are looking at what that really means—what the directives would and would not allow you to do.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">We are looking also at the economic geography argument as to whether it is the case that the airport would act as a pole of attraction, and whether the routes through to the airport—road and rail—would create a stimulus for that area of London. Finally, we are looking at what would induce the airlines to move there. The airlines are saying they do not want to go there because it will be too expensive, but how does that play out? What would the expense need to be and, to </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">feed back</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> from that, what would be the public subsidy for the airport?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">For a decision of such significance, which would be the biggest planning choice that London would make in a generation or more, we feel it is reasonable to do that additional work before we make a firm decision.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q8 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Graham Stringer:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Perhaps I could ask the question in a different way. Do you really think you can form consensus on the basis of closing three airports, to which presumably the owners of those airports would object, and spending £100</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">billion-worth of public money, or a bit more or less, when the expansion of Heathrow or Gatwick—I do not know the finances of Stansted—would probably be commercially viable without any, or very much, public subsidy for extra ground transport? Is that really a possible basis for consensus?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Howard Davies</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: I am not sure I quite recognise the idea that three airports would have to close.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q9 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Graham Stringer:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> It is in the report; you talk about Southend, City and Heathrow.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Howard Davies</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: We think that Heathrow would have to close for commercial reasons, because we do not think that an estuary airport could be built without the assurance for promoters that it would become the hub airport. The only way they could get that assurance is if Heathrow were to be closed. Almost certainly, the only way the Government could give them that assurance would be if they bought it. Although we will do more work on the financing of the estuary, we think that almost certainly the first step would be that the Government would need to acquire Heathrow, and run it up to the point at which a new estuary airport opened. I am not totally clear what it would cost. The sorts of numbers quoted are £13 billion to £15</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">billion. Therefore, the owner of Heathrow would not object, because the owner would have to be the Government before you could actually get the thing opened. Possibly, Southend and London City would. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">London</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">City</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> is a significant point.

However, we also looked at lower and higher ranges of those forecasts. We carried out a high level of uncertainty analysis around that. Even if you look at the top end of our forecasts, or at the previous set of forecasts made by the Department for Transport in 2011, they were roughly equivalent to what Stansted are saying might be achieved now. The broad conclusion that the commission reached would still hold—that Stansted would fill substantially more slowly than Heathrow or Gatwick, which are both operating at almost total capacity at the moment, whereas Stansted is operating at about 50%. With these forecasts, as with any forecasts, there is a certain degree of uncertainty, but I do not think that uncertainty fundamentally changes the conclusions that the commission reached.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q11 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Karen Lumley:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> How quickly did you rule out </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Birmingham</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> airport having a second runway?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Howard Davies</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: We went to </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Birmingham</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> and spent a day there and talked to the airport.

One of the points that came through in the research, quite strongly to me, was that the propensity of people in London and the south-east to fly is substantially higher. The propensity to fly of people living in the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">West Midlands</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> is significantly lower than in the south-east. Therefore, you would be pushing people to take longer journeys to get to their airport if you were expanding Birmingham than if you were expanding an airport in London or the south-east. It seemed to us that it was likely to be a struggle to have another runway and expect it to attract a lot of business from London and the south-east. It would then force people to take longer surface journeys, which itself has bad environmental consequences.

If you ask whether we could have delivered a report before the general election, I am sure we could have delivered a report, but we were asked to do it after. Therefore, our work programme has been designed in such a way that that is what we will achieve. We have taken the opportunity given by that relatively long timetable for our report to do as much work as we can to allow a new Government to hit the ground running when they make a decision. In other words, in our phase 2 we will be doing substantial environmental and surface access assessments, which we will do a lot of the work that a Government would need to do if they made a decision about a particular option. Of course, the Government will need to do some of that work again, but we will leave a memorial to our work in the form of a lot more detailed planning for the option we eventually recommend than would otherwise have been the case.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">My question in a sense is: how long is a piece of string?

They made it absolutely clear to me that regional connectivity—national connectivity, if I am talking about Scotland—is absolutely crucial. It is the case that the number of links from UK regional airports to Heathrow has fallen. You have to be slightly careful because some of the ones that go to Schiphol would not sensibly go to Heathrow anyway. However keen you are on Birmingham, the chances are that you think there will not be many Birmingham-Heathrow flights, so we have to be slightly careful about that comparison.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Undoubtedly it is true that for some people in the regions, connections via </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Dubai</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> in some cases, or Schiphol in others, have become more attractive. Here we have to be slightly realistic. For people wanting to go to, say, a second-tier city in Pakistan from Birmingham, taking a Dubai flight and switching to Air Dubai, which is their low-cost carrier, into Pakistan is probably a perfectly reasonable thing to do. The chances are that even if you had four runways at Heathrow, you would not get flights to second-tier cities in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Pakistan</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. For some of that, you just have to say that is the way the world is going, and that it is an increase in convenience to people visiting friends and relatives and we should not really worry about it.

If you look at the data, which we include in the report, some of the arguments people have advanced about our crisis of connectivity at the moment seem to us to be somewhat overstated, in that if you compare Heathrow with Schiphol, Paris and Frankfurt, which is a reasonable comparison, the figures that suggest Frankfurt has a lot more connections actually relate largely to second-tier Russian cities. The </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">’s trade and investment flows are not particularly with those places.

On the whole, if I were looking at direct routes for people from the south-west just wanting to go to London, I would be slightly surprised if an airline would really want to go to Heathrow anyway and pay that price.

When we think about planning future capacity and talk to people in Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam or New York, the difference is that in this country for the most part public authorities do not own airports, so it is not open to us to say that this airport will be used in this way for that type of traffic. We do not have the levers to pull. In New York, the airport system is owned by the states of New York and New Jersey, and to some extent they have the ability to plan where capacity goes and how it is used, and similarly in other parts of Europe. I think we are the only place which is attempting to manage capacity in a fast-moving global environment without owning the airports. Admittedly, MAG owns Stansted now, and Luton council technically owns the freehold to that airport, though it is run under franchise, but Heathrow and Gatwick are entirely private. We are operating in an environment where you do not have very many tools. The traffic distribution rules cannot be used for that purpose. I hear what you say about the attractiveness of that model, but I am not sure I know how we could decree it, and the market is not supplying it at the moment.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q29 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Sanders:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> I heard a remarkable thing. Apparently, there are two runways at Schiphol that are as far apart as Heathrow is from Northolt, which rather suggests the possibility that Northolt ought to be considered in any look at airport capacity in the south-east of England. What was your view of Northolt? Did you take it into consideration?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Howard Davies</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: We looked at it quite hard. There are complications about Northolt. They are set out in the report, and probably Phil can find the relevant bit. The complications are in a number of different areas. One is that it has heavy military use, and the military need it at the present time. We consulted the Ministry of Defence about their needs for Northolt, and they do need it. There are also problems about the fact that its airspace is essentially coterminous with Heathrow, and therefore additional take-offs and landings at Northolt conflict at the moment with the ones at Heathrow. Even if you had additional flights out of Northolt, you would not necessarily generate a lot more capacity looking at the two airports together.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">There is also a problem about the runway configuration in relation to the road system, which makes it impossible to lengthen it and can put significant constraints on how much you can use it. Transportation from Northolt to Heathrow is quite long and rather unpredictable. We could not see a viable model to put a fast link between Northolt and Heathrow, given the plausible volumes that you could get out of Northolt. We looked at this quite intensively, but our conclusion was that it was not an option that offered any but the most marginal improvement in regional connectivity.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q30 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Jason McCartney:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Continuing on the same theme, for me as a Yorkshire MP, you can replace the south-west with the north.

It produced a bit of movement of flights away from Heathrow, but only those where Heathrow already had the connectivity, so it did not do anything positive for connectivity. It also on average ended up with a more inefficient set of connections and smaller planes, and it was environmentally bad. You had the use of smaller aircraft and lower capacity on those routes, so there were more emissions per passenger mile flown than you would get with the existing configuration. Unfortunately, this did not look like a good option. Some of the details are in the main report. That was a disappointment to us. It did not look as if it worked. One of the problems is that the propensity to fly of people in London and the south-east is significantly higher.

I mentioned the fact that if you want to go to second-tier cities in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Russia</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Frankfurt</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> is probably where you want to go.

We do not think it is enough just to say, “There is a flight to Schiphol, and you can go where you want,” because you cannot. There are places you would want to go to from Heathrow that are not as conveniently served from Schiphol. In particular, the network of routes to </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Philadelphia</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Seattle</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, San Diego and so on that you can get at Heathrow is not matched at Schiphol. The modelling would assume that if there is demand for the routes Heathrow serves, people will try to get to Heathrow to access them, and it would not assume that they would all go to Schiphol, where in some cases they would have to go back to Heathrow on a Schiphol flight to get to </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">San Diego</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">.

For example, if you have business in Vilnius, as I happened to have recently, Ryanair is the way you go; British Airways does not fly to Vilnius, and perhaps is not likely to at the moment.

I am glad we can spend a moment on these short-term things because I think they are quite important. We looked at surface access for existing airports because although inevitably the focus is going to be on the next new runway recommendation—that is the sexy bit—none the less we have a gap of 10 to 15 years before that comes on stream. Therefore, we have to ensure that we can make the best use of the capacity we have at existing airports. The transport links to Gatwick and Stansted in particular leave something to be desired, as we all know.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">We decided to make a submission to the Chancellor before the autumn statement, so the submission was made before the interim report, because we knew the bus was passing and we wanted to get on it. We argued essentially that in circumstances where you had constrained capacity at the most popular airports and where you had a hiatus, inevitably, because of past decisions or lack of them, before new capacity could come on stream, it made sense to attach a higher weight to investments that could improve access to existing airports with spare capacity than you might otherwise do in your normal transport appraisals.

The Treasury agreed with it and said, “Yes, we accept that there are a number of things that could be done,” and essentially they have been pushed up the queue of transport projects. They involve some four-tracking of the line to Stansted, which will improve speeds and reliability for the Stansted Express, and investing in a new station at Gatwick, with longer trains and more luggage-compatible trains. Clearly, a brand new high-speed link to Gatwick is a different order of expenditure; we are talking many billions there. These ideas are in the tens to hundreds of millions, but the Government have said they support that, and they are in the national infrastructure plan which was published in November.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The noise authority is a different type of issue. Our conclusion about noise is that there is a significant failure of trust, if you like, between the various participants assessing noise implications of air transport, whether airports, environmental groups or the CAA.

The airport noise authority would be the expert on measuring noise, setting appropriate parameters for noise, because there is massive dispute about that, as you probably know, and being a statutory </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">consultee</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> on developments that would affect noise.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">We looked at whether this was going to cut across the Civil Aviation Authority.

We therefore hope that when the Government respond to this report, which we understand they are going to do in a couple of months’ time, they pick that up.

Our forecasts are that the numbers of people affected at given noise levels will fall over the next decade or so.

I would not say this is an inevitable awfulness. Clearly, there will be some people who will still be affected by a high and disruptive level of noise, but the numbers are projected to fall. We think that is a fairly safe projection looking at the purchase profiles for new fleets by airlines. It would be nice if 380s and 787s could come into the fleet more quickly, but there is a speed at which they can be produced.

We hope that the Government will pick that up as well, because we think that if we are to get the best out of what will inevitably be constrained airport capacity in a congested corner of a congested island—we are never going to have a massive amount of surplus capacity—we must make sure we manage well what we have got. The future airspace strategy is a crucial part of that as well. We will be staying on top of the Government’s responses to that, and I think we can do that and push forward the phase 2 work.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q45 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Have NATS responded to you in relation to your airspace</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">proposals?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Howard Davies</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: I do not know whether they have formally responded to us, although we had a lot of discussions with them.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Philip Graham</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: We work very closely with them.

You seem to be suggesting in the proposals you have put forward that there would be two hubs: a Heathrow hub and a Gatwick hub. Is that correct? It is a little ambiguous. You talk about point-to-point and then you talk about hub capacity, and you seem to be implying that there could be a Gatwick hub as well as a separate Heathrow hub, and maybe some airlines would move from Heathrow to Gatwick. What is the basis of that thinking, and what real grounds do you have for believing that airlines would move from Heathrow to Gatwick under these proposals?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Howard Davies</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: This is the area that is going to be at the centre of the discussion in the next year, because I think there is a lot of confusion about hubs. Really, a hub is an airline, or conceivably an airline alliance, because it is the airlines that operate the connectivity and manage that process. Therefore, we have suggested it is not at all clear that the choice is between hub and no hub. In the future, there may be a blurring of the lines between what we have traditionally thought of as a hub airport and traditionally origination and destination. For example, Milan airport is operating something called </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">ViaMilano</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> where the airport will manage the connection between airlines, and create a connectivity which the airlines themselves do not wish to do. Maybe that could happen at Gatwick.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The essence of the argument is, what is going to be the future balance between network airlines and point-to-point low-cost carriers? If you look over the last decade, more than all of the growth in aviation demand has been in the low-cost sector in this country, among airlines who do not offer connectivity—who do not see themselves as hubs that are offering a wide range of services but are all operating point-to-point and, if you want to transfer to another airline, that is your business when you get there. Therefore the question is, how is that going to develop in the future? Are we going to see a revival of market share of the network airlines or are we going to see the continuing growth of the low-cost at their expense? In the low-cost sector, are we going to see low-cost move into long haul? Norwegian, for example, are talking actively about that; indeed, they say they are buying some aircraft to do that. Ryanair have talked about it. If that were to happen, it would rather alter the balance between what we have traditionally thought of as hub capacity and point-to-point capacity, because you would have some long haul going from London to, say, New York. If that happens, will it all go from Heathrow? Quite probably not, because if they are offering a low-cost package, they will be looking to go from a lower-cost airport.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">We think that the question of how the balance between what we traditionally thought of as hub capacity and origination and destination business shifts in the future is very important to the type of capacity that you want to have. In a perfect world, you would want to have—if I asked Michael O’Leary what he’d say—well, I won’t say precisely what he says because this is a family audience. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> It’s all right; he has been to this Committee before.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Howard Davies</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: He says, “Build another runway everywhere and then see what the market does.” In fact, we do not think that is likely to be fundable, and we think it would be difficult to support that politically as well, but he has a point, in that we just do not know how the market is going to evolve. You can produce a very plausible argument that the future lies with low-cost airlines offering long-haul routes as well; that that will pull some traffic out of Heathrow to other airports like Gatwick; and that will then leave open some capacity at Heathrow to develop the kinds of things that Heathrow can do very well, which is the new route to Wuhan, but perhaps there would not be 23 flights every day to New York because some of those would be point-to-point from somewhere else.

Of course, if you ask them now, they will say no, but if you said, “Well, what if there wasn’t increased capacity at Heathrow, what </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">would you</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> then do?” maybe you would get a different answer.

Surely, that indicates huge excess demand at the present time, not in 10 years’ time, for slots at Heathrow. The second argument is really </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Davies against Davies. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">You </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">said before</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> that routes are built up by pulling in other routes so that you get connections at the airport. However good aeroplanes get at flying further, being quieter and more efficient, you will always need hub capacity to build up new routes to new economies, will you not? Therefore, you will need a hub.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Howard Davies</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: I think that is very likely, but the question is how big that hub can and should be. Do you get to a point where the hub can be too big, and is not efficient as a transfer mechanism because it is too large? There are people who think about airports who argue that case and say there is an optimal size for a hub, which may not be 1 million passengers a year, because you may then create something that is so large that it does not operate as an efficient transfer mechanism. The question is not whether there will be a need for hub capacity in the sense you describe—I am sure there will be; the question is how much of it, and whether the market will develop in such a way that some of what currently goes on at Heathrow would be better somewhere else. It might be low-cost flights to New York, which would suck some demand out of that, but leaving capacity to develop the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Wuhans</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">I hope you understand that I am not advocating this; I’m just saying this is the argument that the people who advocate a distributed hub option will argue. They say that you should be creating a system that is flexible enough to cope with a different set of future demands, and also to cope with the fact that London has separate catchment areas around it, and a more flexible airline system would better match the nature of London’s particular market, and might be better at coping with the domestic market. Maybe it copes a bit less with transfer passengers, but what should our priority be? That is the way the argument runs.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q58 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Graham Stringer:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> But on the first point about demand for a hub now?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Howard Davies</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: Undoubtedly, that is the case now.

I have said, I hope honestly, that at the moment they would say that is not what they want to do.

On the Isle of Grain, we have said that we are going to do four studies. I can usually remember three of them; Phil will remember the fourth. One of them is on surface access, mainly to London, but also how it would connect up with the rest of the transport network, and whether that is feasible and at what kind of cost. Secondly, on the environmental directives, what is actually possible at that location? How would the alternative sites point and the compensatory habitat points be considered? Thirdly, on the economic geography thing—I say that as shorthand—would this actually promote further economic development in that part of the south-east? Would this have a positive benefit, including the closure of Heathrow, and how would that work? The fourth one is airline behaviour. What would it take to get airlines to want to relocate to a new hub airport? What sort of price would they pay to go there, and what does that tell you about what the price of the airport has to be, and, if there is a gap between the two, what does that tell you about what the public expenditure implications would be? Those are the four pieces of work we will be doing.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The aim is completing those strands of work by June, which we would then publish for comments. Then we would aim to make a decision as to whether we would treat it as a shortlisted option on a par with the others, by early September probably. If we did, we would have to do the same process for that estuary option as we are doing for the other three. For the other three, we published a draft appraisal framework on Thursday. We need to publish that in draft to get comments, because we give six weeks for people to comment on whether the criteria we are looking at are appropriate. If they, or something like them, are found to be appropriate in six weeks’ time, we will publish them finally.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The promoters of the three schemes are then required to put to us a business case and strategic analysis. For Gatwick, it would have to cover all these points. They would have to articulate why they thought this matched what was going to happen to the airlines, so the promoters themselves will have to do some of this work. We will get those assessments in the summer and consult publicly on them in the autumn. Around the turn of the year, or in the first month or two of next year, we will put cold towels round our heads, take our phones off the hook, put on one of those e-mail messages saying, “You will not have an e-mail until June,” and go away and think about what our recommendations are going to be.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q62 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> How long would it take to construct the options you have now—the two Heathrow options and the Gatwick one—and what would be the cost with the infrastructure?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Howard Davies</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: Do you remember the timetable we set them?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Philip Graham</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: Our assessment was that the Heathrow north-west runway option could, with a fair wind, be potentially constructed by around 2026, assuming there was a rapid decision after the final report was published.

In</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> relation to the Isle of Grain, the timing of that is likely to flow to some degree out of the additional studies we are carrying out, because a crucial element of that will be the feasibility and timing of delivering the surface access.

A think-tank called Policy Exchange did the work on it. Heathrow themselves looked at it, and we did also. The essence of that proposal would have been to shift the centre of gravity of the airport much further to the west. The difficult part of it was building over reservoirs. The advice we received from Thames Water was that this was extremely difficult. People will never tell you that anything is absolutely impossible, but while it is true, as </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">this Committee knows well, that no runway has been built in the south-east of England since 1945, apparently neither has any new reservoir been constructed in about the same period. Therefore, we thought that finding alternative locations for all of that reservoir capacity—the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Wraysbury</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> reservoir and another one whose name I forget—was just too difficult and too expensive, and took too long. Apparently, the process of constructing reservoirs—you can imagine the infrastructure that goes with a reservoir—was such that we did not feel that was a feasible option. It was very attractive in lots of ways, and we reached that conclusion with some regret, but that was where we came out.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36.85pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Thank you very much.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Howard Davies</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: You’re welcome.
