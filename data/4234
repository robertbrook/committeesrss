EuPC now totals 51 European plastics converting national and European industry associations; it represents close to 50,000 companies, producing over 45 million tonnes of plastic products every year. The European plastics industry makes a significant contribution to welfare in Europe by enabling innovation, creating quality of life for citizens and facilitating resource efficiency and climate protection. More than 1.6 million people are working in EU converting companies (mainly SMEs) to create a turnover in excess of €300 billion per year.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">EuPC, as the EU level trade body for users (converters) of plastics (polymer) materials, welcomes this Common’s select committee initiative on plastic bags and the dialogue that should come between the entire value chain for plastic products and society. As users of plastic materials we believe our written submission has added value. We have a neutral position on the materials used to produce plastic products as long as these provide the right quality to serve the customers’ needs. Converters only want their materials to be as sustainable as possible. Furthermore, converters acknowledge the environmental concerns surrounding certain waste streams (e.g. marine litter and Member State specific waste stream issues) and we are ready to work together with the entire value chain to further develop responses to these environmental concerns. </span></p><ol type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 32.29pt; padding-left:3.71pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">EuPC commissioned tests on the effects of degradable and oxo-fragmentable plastic carrier bags on recycling streams </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">In early 2013, EuPC commissioned the independent entity TCKT (the Transfer Center for Polymer Technology) to conduct independent industrial tests on the effects of degradable and oxo-fragmentable plastic carrier bags on the quality of plastics recycling. Therefore, four different mixtures of degradable plastic bags (3 biodegradable and one oxo-fragmentable) and one virgin LDPE recycling material were tests over the course of six months and from this material more than 3,700 measurements were made. The tests saw 9.45 tonnes of plastic bags being processed. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">1.1 </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Methodology and testing of the materials</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The testing methodology was based on the EPBP (European PET Bottle Platform), procedure which </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">aims at analysing the impact of certain material at various </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">testing levels </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">(</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> 2, 5, 10 and 50% </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">)</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">of test specimens (i.e. the materials being tested), in the recyclates mixture. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The tests began with the collection of all kinds of pre-consumer plastic carrier bags available on the EU market (pre-consumer means the test results would be a best case scenario for the tested materials and post consumer waste would have even lower mechanical properties).

These different mixtures (labelled DEG1, DEG2, DEG3, DEG4*) of materials were then recycled.
