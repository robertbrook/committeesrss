This is a time-consuming and expensive job- notices must be put up, responses collected from organisations and individuals, responses are considered in great detail, reports are written, public meetings are held, committees meet and appeals are dealt with. Once BOAT status has been determined, national parks and councils may then consider whether Traffic Restriction Orders are required to protect the tracks, the adjoining countryside or the non-motorised users.  This involves more notices, meetings, collection and consideration of evidence and finally if a TRO is recommended, wealthy off-roader organisations usually immediately appeal to the High Court.  This incurs huge costs for the councils and national parks at a time when their budgets have been cut.  Automatically redefining all unsealed green lanes as 'restricted </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Byeways</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">' would at a stroke put an end to all of this.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Damage to green lanes:  </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Unsealed green lanes are ancient tracks never designed to take heavy motorised traffic.  Their current use by motorised off-roaders damages the lanes, causing deep ruts</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">,  which</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> make the lanes difficult for walkers and horse riders to use.

It simply isn't safe for non-motorised users such as walkers and horse riders to share narrow tracks with motorised vehicles.  Motorbikes in particular often come in convoy and at speed, expecting </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">everyone to leap out of their way and horse riders, sitting on a flight animal, are at particular risk.  4 x 4 vehicles often completely fill a narrow track and riders and walkers have nowhere to get out of the way. Sadly, most non-motorised users, </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">myself</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> included, will not now use green lanes where we have to face such dangerous situations. Councils and national parks do have the ability to apply Traffic Restriction Orders but the process is extremely time-consuming and expensive and each proposed TRO is immediately appealed to the High Court by wealthy off-roader organisations. </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Out of the many lanes which are considered by the Peak Park Authority to be a priority for action only a few have been dealt with to date and all are currently mired in lengthy and expensive legal challenges.</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">  This picture is replicated across the country on a lane by lane basis. The Peak Park is meant to be a place where people can relax, enjoy the countryside and get some exercise. However, walkers and riders will simply not use tracks which they do not consider to be safe and it is so unfair for us not to be able to exercise our right to use these beautiful lanes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">6. </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Other users deterred from using green lanes: </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">As our roads get ever busier, our quiet green lanes become an ever more important resource for walkers, cyclists and particularly horse riders. However, the danger of meeting convoys of fast motorbikes with their noisy exhausts on a narrow lane means that many of us are deterred from using green lanes. The government is keen to encourage people to increase physical activity to benefit their health but the current situation with green lanes is having the opposite effect and deterring people from using green lanes.  I personally no longer use the local green lanes that for the past 25 years I have accessed weekly to ride my horse and walk my dog. This is happening all over the country and is a great </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">national  tragedy</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">7. </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Nuisance: </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Anyone who has met a convoy of noisy fast-moving motorbikes on a green lane will attest to the nuisance - the noise, the smell of the exhaust fumes and often the need to leap into the nettles at the side of the track to get out of the way of convoys who unfortunately do not always see the need to slow down for pedestrians and horse riders. Residents living near green lanes endure the constant noise (particularly loud motorbike exhausts) and farmers using green lanes to access their livestock often find access difficult at busy times </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">ie</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">. </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">weekends</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">.
