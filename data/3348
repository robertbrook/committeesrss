Our members recognise that large scale transformational change is necessary to redesign services to better meet the needs of patients and get better value from NHS resources. But transformational change takes time to bring about and requires clinical leadership, strong, stable, management and effective well-informed commissioners. It also needs to have support from the public and politicians – it is essential for there to be local engagement, public discussions and an understanding about why change is necessary so that planned changes can be implemented. </span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; margin:12pt 0pt 9pt 13.25pt; padding-left:8.05pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Measuring NHS productivity, or efficiency, is complicated and we do not have the data to allow us to be unequivocal about the effect of the efficiency challenge.

It is inevitable that in making changes, different models of services will be created and in general these would be expected to improve quality while reducing costs. In some cases, where the clinical evidence supports it, some services will no longer be provided, or will be provided differently to make them clinically, operationally and financially sustainable.</span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; margin:12pt 0pt 9pt 13.25pt; padding-left:8.05pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Given the length of time required to undertake the transformation of services required, it is not surprising that the NHS is finding it difficult to achieve the ‘Nicholson Challenge’.

The services provided by the NHS are broadly consistent across the country, suggesting the allocations formula is not materially incorrect for most organisations. However, the picture is clouded with some outlying organisations receiving additional funding to deal with specific financial pressures or to help them balance the books. This in part may be due to the formula not recognising certain costs with sufficient accuracy, for instance, the cost of healthcare in rural areas or with particular populations.</span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; margin:12pt 0pt 9pt 13.25pt; padding-left:8.05pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Members reported concerns about the 2012/13 allocations, particularly how the specialised services funding was dealt with, which caused difficulties at the beginning of the financial year and may continue to do so until year-end. </span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; margin:12pt 0pt 9pt 13.25pt; padding-left:8.05pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">As the financial position gets tighter, we expect the effectiveness of the allocation system to be tested. We support NHS England’s review of the allocation process and welcome the announcement that two year allocations will be made for 2014/15 and 2015/16, which will hopefully facilitate two-year contracts between commissioners and providers. There are different ways of allocating funds and hence perceptions of areas that are over or under-funded. For instance, the current debate around whether the allocation formula takes sufficient account of unmet need and the use of age and deprivation factors, and provides sufficient funding for the costs of the services provided and required. Some of our members feel that there is already a robust formula for allocating resources but that it is not yet applied consistently, with areas receiving additional funding through opaque methods such as the provision of financial support and the £250 million winter pressures funding for accident and emergency departments. </span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; margin:12pt 0pt 9pt 13.25pt; padding-left:8.05pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">An effective mechanism ought to take into account population health and needs including social care needs; some members felt the current system is not sufficiently responsive to variations in health outcomes.

This reduces the prices paid by commissioners to providers. At the same time, providers must also deal with initiatives aimed at moving care to more appropriate settings, often outside of hospital. HFMA supports changes to care pathways that are beneficial to patients, but the risk of financial instability where this occurs at an unplanned pace or where transitional arrangements are not evaluated must be recognised. Our members suggest that the position is now becoming unsustainable and unachievable without the transformational change referred to in the response to question 1. Our members also pointed to other exacerbating factors such as the difficulty of accurately estimating and funding the NHS for health care cost inflation and the impact of policy initiatives such as the marginal rate for emergency activity. </span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; margin:12pt 0pt 9pt 18.75pt; padding-left:2.55pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">We believe that providers will find it increasingly difficult to improve quality without transformational change. Providers need to be clinically, operationally and financially sustainable and in our opinion this points to consolidating services on fewer sites, working in collaboration and the integration of services. There is a trend towards greater clinical specialisation and an increasing recognition that some services are better delivered from centres of excellence, enabling a concentration of clinical expertise, with the right patient flows to maintain and improve skills and the use of the latest equipment. Patient safety and quality of services must be the key drivers for change. Focusing on these issues can also lead to a more cost effective way of delivering services. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 9pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q4 Reports of particular financial pressures in the system, such as funding general practice, and for accident and emergency services</span></p><ol start="14" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; margin:12pt 0pt 9pt 18.75pt; padding-left:2.55pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">We asked our members about the financial pressures and concerns in their local areas. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:12pt 0pt 9pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Cost pressures</span></p><ol start="15" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; margin:12pt 0pt 9pt 18.75pt; padding-left:2.55pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Our members mentioned the following cost pressures that are affecting their local areas (not all of the issues apply to every local health economy):</span></li></ol><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:12pt 0pt 9pt 31.82pt; padding-left:3.63pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Shortages of specific staff groups are resulting in increased costs due to the need to use agency staff and locums to cover permanent staff vacancies.

Members felt that budget reductions had impacted on social services’ response times and a lack of availability at weekends and bank holidays was resulting in more delayed discharges. Some members told us that community teams have been disbanded due to funding pressures and one local authority approached a CCG to request funding for a key service it could no longer support. Some members felt that, although they understood the financial pressure local authorities face, they saw some ‘cost shifting’ to the NHS.</span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; margin:12pt 0pt 9pt 18.75pt; padding-left:2.55pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Our members agree with the principle of joint funding. However, they had concerns about transferring money from the NHS to put into the integration transformation fund, as it will add to the financial pressure on the NHS in the short-term as social care services have not yet been developed to cope with demand. Our members are also concerned that funds will not be spent on developing new arrangements, but on making good local authority funding shortfalls and supporting existing services. In the short-term, our members see the transfers as reductions to CCG budgets, which may increase the efficiency savings required by NHS organisations, including those in the secondary care sector. </span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; margin:12pt 0pt 9pt 18.75pt; padding-left:2.55pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Some members felt that it was incorrect to say that the NHS budget is protected when in reality NHS funds are being passed to local authorities that have been subject to cuts.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 9pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q7 Progress on making efficiencies through the integration of health and social care services. </span></p><ol start="24" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18.75pt; padding-left:2.55pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Our members recognise the need for change, based on the findings of the Berwick</span><a name="_ftnref9"></a><a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> and Francis</span><a name="_ftnref10"></a><a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> reports of 2013.

In some areas this involves working across several separate local authorities, CCGs and NHS providers, before even considering the third sector. Working in partnership with other bodies can often be challenging and though there may not be statutory barriers, good working relationships between senior officers is often the key to successful integrated working. Integrating services is not made easier by increasing the number of statutory decision making bodies in an area.</span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; margin:12pt 0pt 9pt 18.75pt; padding-left:2.55pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">In our opinion the real efficiencies, and hence ability to deliver the ‘Nicholson Challenge’ and subsequent efficiency requirements, will come from significant changes to care pathway management and the greater use of centres of excellence which will improve outcomes and allow patients to stay well for longer. This should be complemented by payment mechanisms that encourage innovation. Moving to this approach will require some innovative commissioning decisions and the ability to implement planned changes quickly. This is not always possible where competition rules create barriers or public and political considerations are allowed to hold back change unduly.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:12pt 0pt 9pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="line-height:19.2pt; margin:0pt 0pt 9pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">November 2013</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div><hr style="width:33%; height:1px; text-align:left" /><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn1"></a><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic">The NHS belongs to the people: A call to action</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">, NHS England, 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn2"></a><a href="#_ftnref2">[2]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic">2012/13 update on indicators of financial sustainability in the NHS</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">, National Audit Office, 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn3"></a><a href="#_ftnref3">[3]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic">Summer Report for the period 1 April to 31 July 2013</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">, NHS Trust Development Authority, 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn4"></a><a href="#_ftnref4">[4]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic">Annual Plan Review 2013/14</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">, Monitor, 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn5"></a><a href="#_ftnref5">[5]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">The arrangements have changed and as from 1 April 2013 FTs </span><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">are issued with licences rather than terms of authorisation.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn6"></a><a href="#_ftnref6">[6]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic">Report of the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust Public Inquiry</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">, 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn7"></a><a href="#_ftnref7">[7]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic">Emergency admissions to hospital: managing the demand</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">, National Audit Office, 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn8"></a><a href="#_ftnref8">[8]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic">Budget Survey 2013 Summary</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">, ADASS, 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn9"></a><a href="#_ftnref9">[9]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic">A Promise to Learn – A Commitment to Act: Improving the Safety of Patients in England,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt"> National Advisory Group on the Safety of Patients in England, 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn10"></a><a href="#_ftnref10">[10]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic">Report of the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust Public Inquiry</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">, 2013</span></p></body></html>
