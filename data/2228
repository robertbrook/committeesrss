Coverage of women's sports needs role models: people who capture the imagination. I have also thought for a while it would be great to link women's sports as events with their male equivalents. At Wimbledon, a day at centre court can mean a game or two of each, or doubles. I would love to see a women's football game played pre-match or post-match of a Premier League game. The crowds would not be massive but some of the crowd who come early/stay late can see the women's game and begin to develop a stronger bond with it.</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:5pt 0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">"In terms of participation in sport, the DCMS should do more to prevent schools selling of their playing fields."</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">The sports PR</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">"I worked as a press officer for a Championship football club; this is one area in football clubs where there tend to be more women.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">"Part of my role was to meet the football manager after the game, outside the changing room, so I could escort him to meet the press.
