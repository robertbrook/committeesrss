Our European regional development fund and European social fund programmes are worth over £1 billion over seven years, and that is half EU funding, half match funding. Outside London, local enterprise partnerships have been charged with developing a pipeline of projects but civil servants remain responsible for programme management, whereas my team at the GLA manage both ERDF and ESF in London as an intermediate body on behalf of Government.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Our local enterprise partnership arrangements also differ a little.

The current 2007 to 2013 programmes are upskilling 50,000 people, getting another 50,000 Londoners into work, including over 14,000 14 to 19 year-olds. We expect these new programmes to achieve something similar in respect of the 128,000 or so 16 to 24 year-olds not in education, employment or training.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The final and most important point that I want to emphasise is that we work in partnership with </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> boroughs and business to ensure that employment funds for </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">—from Government, EU or anywhere else—are put to the best possible use. Our LEP has a skills and employment group, which is chaired by two </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> businesspeople, Grant Hearn of Travelodge, and Jack Morris of the Business Design Centre. It builds on the work of the previous London Skills &amp; Employment Board, and the partners represented on that group will be the means by which we check that YEI funds are utilised effectively. I also want to highlight the Young People’s Education and Skills Board for </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">. That is the lead strategic body for 14 to 19 year-old education and training provision in relation to the needs of learners and employers. It is run by </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> councils who run these pan-London services on behalf of the 33 boroughs.

I think that will come out during the questioning. I want to make a statement around the political ambition and the political leadership we are taking in </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Birmingham</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> around youth unemployment and, effectively, how we want to see a greater alignment of the EU resources to the local investments that we are keen to develop. Our strapline is "From fragmented to integrated", and that is effectively where we want to take this. Through the political leadership, we have developed a youth unemployment commission that is aimed at bringing together all local stakeholders and partners towards developing a much more integrated approach to tackling the deep-rooted problems that we have around youth unemployment in the area. We fundamentally believe that EU resources could and should be better deployed in our local area.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Our ambition is to try to develop local co-investment strategies around how EU resources should be more appropriately and effectively aligned to local provision, not just aligned to national commissioning strategies through skills funding agencies and the Department for Work and Pensions, but utilising national, local resources within one integrated framework akin to the strategy to make an integrated programme, rather than what we believe is currently a fragmented one that is not meeting local need. Our will to come and provide evidence to this Committee is about outlining how we believe we need to make better, more effective use of the EU structural funds moving forward than we have done in recent years.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> I see.

What distinction do you draw, if any, between the so-called NEETs, young people looking for work, and other types of young people who may fit into a category? I have briefly referred to that. We intend the question to help us compare the definitions and understandings used at EU, Government and local authority levels. There seems to be a lot of confusion on this. Who would like to lead on that?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Shilpi Akbar</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: Shall I start?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Yes, please.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Shilpi Akbar</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: There is a fundamental issue in terms of wanting to categorise young people because I think therein lie some of the challenges. What we have, certainly within our city, within our local enterprise partnership area, are young people from 15 right up to 24 who, for those who can see a route or way through from formal school age through GCSEs into perhaps A levels and then into a degree, see a very clear pathway and that is a very structured pathway. Others, though, may not see a future based on an academic route that keeps them in formal education. Many people who we see falling out of the system often can be identified very early on, perhaps while they are at school in formal education. Those individuals could be identified as being at risk of being NEET.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The problem that we have is that agencies want to classify and categorise young people. It is based on some of that categorisation and, therefore, eligibility that we start to programme resources, depending on how old they are, how long they have been out of work perhaps and whether they have been out of work for six months or 12 months. But what we need to do is see young people exactly as they are: young people who are trying to find a way in life, trying to better themselves and achieve something. Essentially, as a local authority, we want to be able to support those pathways to a life of independence, prosperity with very little dependency on public sector services. What this European funding is designed to do is to give young people the hope that there are safety nets and guarantees for them, which is going to help them along that journey.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Yes, we categorise them at different stages: when they leave school between 16 right up until 18 and they are classified as NEET by the Education Funding Agency, and then they are classified as not being in employment by DWP, by the Skills Funding Agency. What we tend to do is put them in little compartments and pigeonholes and we treat them in different ways at different times in their life.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Who do you mean by “we”?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Shilpi Akbar</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: I would say public sector agencies.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> I see, thank you.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Shilpi Akbar</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: However, from a local authority perspective, we have a leadership role, which is not about the resources that we hold. It is about how those resources impact and how those services impact on our citizens in particular neighbourhoods and in particular communities and on particular families.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Alex Conway</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: I will answer this question in a slightly different way. NEET is an all-encompassing term, which I think is pretty consistent everywhere and includes everybody. For our purposes, that means an unemployed Oxbridge graduate and, as an example, a homeless drug-addict parent with mental health issues who dropped out of school at 15. Both those categories are NEET. I do not think we need to use EU YEI money to worry about the former who will sort themselves out, but we need to focus on moving the latter towards the employment ladder.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Can I just ask for clarification there? Somebody who drops out of school and is looking after somebody else, they cannot be NEETs because they are not going to get any benefits until the age of 18. How do you categorise those? They are not NEETs. At least in my definition, NEETs are people who are at least 18.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Alex Conway</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: No, my understanding would be that, from the Commission or Government’s perspective, those people may not be claiming benefits but they are still NEET.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lord Haskel:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> But they are not entitled to benefits.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Yes, that is right.

Thank you for the paper, which is lengthy but stimulating and gave rise to a number of questions from many of us that we will want to pursue later. There is a general consensus that youth unemployment across Europe is a particularly serious aspect of the current economic crisis across most of </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">. However, some would argue that there is a mismatch and that the unemployment arises because of the mismatch between the skills or absence of skills that individuals have compared with the jobs that require particular skills. On the other hand, others will argue that, at the end of the day, the real problem is that there are not enough jobs there to employ people regardless of whether or not they have the skills. What would you say about that in the light of your experience? Could you please summarise for us your view of exactly what the nature is of the current problems in your area? I know we have had your paper already, but we would be grateful if you could boil this down into a fairly concise response for </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Birmingham</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">. We would be very interested indeed to hear what the position is in </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">. Who is affected by this and in what ways are they affected?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Shilpi Akbar</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: I will start by giving you some examples from </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Birmingham</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">. In terms of the causes of the spike and the serious issue about youth unemployment, which we looked at through the Birmingham Commission on Youth Unemployment this time last year, what we found was there were several reasons why there seemed to be a rise in the number of young people out of work. That was borne out by evidence taken from a cross-sector partnership.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">What witnesses to that commission were telling us was that clearly there was the impact of the recession. There was no doubt that young people bore the brunt of the lack of jobs, or the number of people that were being made redundant, losing their jobs and finding themselves participating in a very competitive marketplace, where they were pitching themselves for opportunities against people who had been made redundant, who probably had far better skills and were able to transfer those skills into the job opportunities that were available. That was one thing.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">There was clearly a lack of jobs, and even businesses were very nervous about bringing jobs forward to the marketplace because they were uncertain about their own productivity, the number of orders, and their order books. Even if there were opportunities, the nature of that employment offer perhaps was not full-time. It may have been part-time, so the opportunities were much less.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">I also think there is something in the skills mismatch. In </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Birmingham</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> we were seeing a very much improved set of results coming out of our schools. We were better than our local authority neighbours. Far more young people are achieving their GCSEs and achieving what we feel is the average for young people, so we were exceeding those. Yet employers were still not recruiting young people who were presenting themselves for work.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">That mismatch between academic achievement versus employability skills and the softer skills that employers were looking for was expressed time and time again by businesses in the commission. Not only that, but we saw that where Government or national incentives were in place—being made available by the National Apprenticeship Service, by DWP—there was a lot going on. Certainly at a national level, agencies were desperately trying to put support in place to help young people.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">What that generated was a very confused marketplace for businesses to navigate through the plethora of support and the financial packages. If you wanted to take an apprentice, the eligibility rules were about you as a company, but if you wanted to recruit specifically somebody that was long-term unemployed, then it was about the individual and their eligibility. Businesses were saying, “We do not want to bother. We will go off and we will recruit somebody else”. There was an acknowledgement that we were all trying to do our bit locally, but it was not cohesive, it was fragmented and disparate. Therefore, with the packages that were put in place for young people, there was demonstrable market failure on behalf of what everybody was trying to do in terms of supporting young people.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The other thing to say is that recently the Local Government Association produced a report that talked about lots and lots of training and qualifications being delivered by the further education sector, by training providers, but there was a mismatch between what was being delivered within the training family, the community of training providers, and what employers were asking for. The title of that report was something like, “Are we training too many hairdressers when we need engineers and people with automotive skills and the ability to make things, and we need more people with digital and IT technology?” There is something very much in that about what we are churning out, in terms of qualifications of young people and what businesses want. I will stop there.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Could I ask for the title of that report again and when it was published?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Shilpi Akbar</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: It was published last year.

I wonder where you thought the relevant intervention was between charitable activity in getting people into work to address their social needs or an economic opportunity of trying to bring people that are just unemployable up to scratch so that they become employable. Where are you in that spectrum?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Alex Conway</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: That is a very interesting question. When people are devising EU funding-based contracts that all offer rewards for getting people into work, you have to start taking pretty close account of those kinds of issues.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">As a broad-brush statement I would say that an opportunity that you have with EU funds, which you do not necessarily have with domestic funding, is to try different things, including perhaps rather expensive things. If you need to treat drug addiction it is a very expensive business which is not typically sitting in a Jobcentre budget. Perhaps using YEI money you can say, “Here is something we really want to try with a limited cohort of people, to get somebody who is not going to enter the job market overnight but with a lot of time might get a little bit nearer”. The problem we always tend to have—and charities will say this time and again—is you are moving somebody up the job ladder but not necessarily into work, but the reward mechanisms are always about getting people into work and that means people will just cherry pick the “easier to do” people. How do you draw a line? Again, there is no easy answer to that. I think the answer is you have some fairly complex packages about trying to incentivise people to deal with the hardest to reach and not making it too easy for people just to deal with the dead weight of people who will find work anyway.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Baroness Valentine:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Do you hope that once they are in work those people will add value? Do you have any measure that says having put these people in work they should repay their salary in terms of added value? Where does that come into the thinking?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Alex Conway</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: I think the fundamental thinking from this Government, and pretty much every Government, is getting anyone into any kind of paid work is absolutely crucial for avoiding the ultimate cost to society of a life on benefits. Essentially, there is almost no question that almost any kind of work is better than someone who is not doing anything.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Baroness Valentine:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> My point is that coming out of recession you obviously want your businesses to be as competitive as possible, and if there is a philosophy around where you are mentoring or training people, it can be a cost in the early years.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Alex Conway</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: Yes.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Baroness Valentine:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> As you are trying to come out of recession, is that the right time to be putting that drag on to business, as you could describe it in one sense? I am not trying to argue against it; I just wonder if you have a view on whether, when they first go in, they should be delivering at or exceeding the amount they are paid.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Alex Conway</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: Yes. One of the many things that the Government has been trying out is payments particularly to small businesses to encourage people to take on apprenticeships. I think the jury is still out on whether these kinds of payments work, but it seems to me that it is certainly something that is worth trying. This leads on to a question we might come to later about how willing employers are to engage with these kinds of things. Some will be; some will not be. If a cash incentive helps, then it is probably a price worth paying in my view.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Thank you.

Of course, I recognise we are talking about a very wide spectrum of people, but there are certain common denominators. Do you find that among employers there is a concern about youth unemployment or very little concern? We can go on enjoying the same sort of routine as before? What do you find? Do they offer any avenue of help? Are they concerned about the issue or more concerned about how they operate themselves?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Shilpi Akbar</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: When we have looked at this particular issue we have done it alongside employers and employers expressing to us what it is that they felt were the issues. What we are finding in </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Birmingham</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">—and I think this is true in other cities—is that there is a growing concern about our young people, the fact that essentially young people are the future workforce. Therefore, if they are not displaying or providing the right skills that businesses require for those businesses to grow, to be productive and to remain competitive, not only locally, regionally or nationally but also globally, then they have to think about how they are going to continue to be successful businesses. That means looking at their current workforce, and some of those businesses are recognising that their profile is now an ageing one. We have businesses in </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Birmingham</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> and more widely across the enterprise partnership area that are concerned that they are not bringing enough toolmakers into their businesses. If they want to produce a skilled toolmaker to replace the person that has been in their workforce for 30 or 40 years, they should have started training that person a very long time ago.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Surely that is exactly the place where apprentices should be?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Shilpi Akbar</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: Absolutely, and apprenticeships are not necessarily a one-year apprenticeship or a two-year apprenticeship.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> No, of course not; five and 10 years, yes.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Shilpi Akbar</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: They should be five years, 10 years. A doctor or somebody going through medical school is an apprentice for seven years. We need to think more about young people not necessarily coming in with the right skills from day one but coming in as trainees.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lord Clinton-Davis:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Is the view you express that of many employers, or not enough of them?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Shilpi Akbar</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: Employers are beginning to recognise that they are going to have to co-invest. That means they are going to have to give up their time and support those young people just as much as public sector agencies, and it is a right and responsibility of young people themselves. There are lots of parts to play here and different parts to bring together.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lord Clinton-Davis:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> How is that manifested?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Shilpi Akbar</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: Some businesses quite welcome other agencies and training professionals going into their businesses and helping to train young people. Very small companies have very little time to train young people but are willing to send them off to college for one or two days a week to help in that. Some of them welcome the Government incentives that exist to offset some of the costs for training and view it as an investment into their company. Without a doubt, there are businesses who feel that what is important to them is running their business and what they want is an oven-ready person to come in. There is a duty also to create those people, perhaps using larger employers who can provide the environment to train some young people with a view not to keep them but perhaps to pass them on to their supply chain companies. That is something that we are seeing more and more of, about how we share the burden of training.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> That is very interesting.

Do the funds that are available from the European Union allow for that to happen? Are there programmes of funding that will allow a seven-year fellowship or apprenticeship—whatever it is called—to be established to take an individual from the outset and train them to a very highly skilled place?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lloyd Broad</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: Historically, no. Although they work in seven-year cycles, European funding programmes have invariably supported short-term projects that last two or three years. Therefore, it is always short-termism. I think the approach that is now being taken for the next seven-year cycle, 2014 to 2020, is encouraging local enterprise partnerships and their local authorities to develop longer-term solutions and—as I tried to outline in my opening discussion—to develop much more integrated longer-term strategic plans. This will allow us to develop much more coherent and longer-term working relationships with business and local organisations that can help us work with the supply and the demand.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The answer to your question in terms of what we would want to do with EU funds and how we can use them in the programme moving forward with greater local accountability, is that we want to use the different EU funds and the local investments to support business in a much more integrated business gateway that links skills, skill support and working with the supply of labour, with the demand for labour and to tailor-make the oven-ready provision to them.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lord Kakkar:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Going forward, does what is proposed facilitate that, or are there roadblocks?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lloyd Broad</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: Yes, it can do. In the local enterprise partnership areas we are responsible for developing our seven-year strategies, and we have just done the first draft. They are finalised in January. We have outlined our seven-year strategic plans, which aim to do just that. The holistic business gateway proposal that brings different funds together to support business, not just with skills but other types of business support provision in a more holistic way, is our ambition. That is the point that I made at the beginning about integration rather than fragmentation, and what Shilpi said about compartmentalising various people in various ways and different types of activity happening in different places and never in one all-encompassing single way. That is the approach we want to take with the EU funds.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lord Clinton-Davis:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Can you influence the MEPs in your area in the direction you prefer?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lloyd Broad</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: I do not think it is the MEPs that are the problem for us.

Therefore, they prefer to take a more centralist approach to the overall management of EU programmes, notwithstanding in this next period they are putting the strategic focus in the hands of local areas. What we are looking for is greater local accountability over how we deploy those funds locally alongside other local investments in one seven-year strategic plan.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Alex Conway</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: Just to enforce Lloyd’s point, your point that there are other member states that do manage programmes over seven-year periods and have seven-year budgets, the reason we do not have it in the UK is basically to do with spending review timetables, which stem nationally and then feed down locally as well. If Government is doling out money in three-year chunks and </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Birmingham</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> only knows how much money it has for three years, projects are unlikely to last more than three years.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q37 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> You made one interesting comment.

It is those sorts of powers that we all cry out for. However, there is so much EU regulation around EU resources, if it is not managed and accounted for and reported in the very auditable way in which the European Commission expects, there is a risk that if it is not managed properly it gets paid back. English programmes and </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> programmes have fallen foul of subtleties within those regulations and, therefore, funding gets suspended or programmes get suspended as a result.

It is all of those things and a few other things. As a local authority there are a number of levers that we have where we can influence the labour market or the jobs market, or even capture jobs for particular groups that we feel are a priority; in this case, young people. The budget is diminishing—it feels like by the week at the moment—and we used to have a budget of £3 billion. We were the largest local authority in </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">. Our spending power is huge. If we are buying and procuring services, whether they are goods, services, construction, whatever, what we can write into those contracts is, “We would like you to do something for us if you are going to deliver a building for us”, for instance. Within that, we can stipulate that, “We want to work with you because surely, as a result of winning this contract, you might have a few more people you need to recruit. We would like some of those to be apprentices and we would like some of those to be apprentices from </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Birmingham</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">, perhaps even from a particular neighbourhood where there are lots of young people who are unemployed”. That is where we can talk to them. It is not about policing what they do but supporting them to find the right people.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">What we do with our local partners is to prepare them for those particular jobs. We can read the labour market and we have some knowledge of where the sectors are growing. As we know, there are a lot of jobs in the health and social care sector. We have an ageing population. We need to take care of our elderly, and we need to bring in more well trained and very well qualified young people to provide a good high-quality of care. We are purchasing those services as a local authority, so we have a duty to make sure we have a response to that demand. The local enterprise partnerships are very much placing themselves in that position. We know where our growth sectors are, but what we need to be doing is taking that information and putting it into schools, giving it to careers advisers so that they can advise young people about the right qualifications they should be taking and  the right routes that they should be following, such as “Do you need maths and English and science for this or do you need something else?” We need to be informing our young people right through school so that they can be helped and supported to make the right choices, so that we have enough people to make our cars, support our elderly residents in care and so on.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> I think that is great.

What we are finding is that we often have between 10 and 15 people chasing a retail job in a supermarket and perhaps two people chasing a job at a higher skill level. There is that mismatch. We need to have a look at that and look more at how we are fostering high-level skills, not only through an academic route but through an apprenticeship route. That needs to be on the job, in companies, and look at high-level apprenticeship schemes and not just people going through school, college and university.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Of course you could miss out.

There are two things here. One of them is what happens to individuals when they leave school. Many schools now encourage their pupils to stay on until sixth form and there is a growing marketplace to retain children in school. Some schoolchildren leave school because it was not suitable for them, but there is an onus now and there is a public duty on schools to publish the destinations of every single individual school leaver. The feedback we are getting from schools is that they keep the good ones and the other ones go off somewhere else. Hopefully, they are going off into colleges, undertaking some vocational education and training. Some of them will go to other voluntary sector training providers, for instance, or even private sector training providers.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">What we have found—and I think this is the answer that you are looking for—is that most employers are saying whenever they come out they are still not ready for work. The feedback we are getting is that when individuals, and particularly young people, present themselves for interview they do not have the required skills.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">One of the things that we are doing in Birmingham local authority is introducing the Birmingham baccalaureate, which is almost a certification or a qualification based on employability skills that have been pulled together by the Confederation of British Industry, the CBI, with seven indicators of what makes a good employee. Those good soft skills include problem solving, communication skills, team working and building those skills into the curriculum. When they are doing their geography or their maths, what does that mean in terms of problem-solving capabilities? How are you going to demonstrate those to an outside organisation? That needs to happen all the way through school, not just in your two-week work experience, which often they get.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q40 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lord Freeman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Thank you for your written evidence from Birmingham City Council. Reading it, I got the impression of complexity in organisational structure and duplication. After all, we have had a recession now for six years and we are still talking about introducing new initiatives. If you would not mind being candid with the Committee, within the West Midlands conurbation I counted at least six different organisations—including the employers involved, the voluntary sector obviously, Birmingham City Council, but also the LEPs and Greater Birmingham—if you were in charge, and if you had the authority, how would you simplify the structure to make sure that we are helping young people with the minimum of bureaucracy and the minimum of complexity?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Shilpi Akbar</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: The major thing for me is to keep it simple and uncomplicated, so that young people when they leave school or find themselves wanting a job or wanting training know where to go to get it. So that there is clear signposting, there is a single gateway and they know what they are going to get when they knock on that door and express themselves as needing some support. The great majority of young people will not need that support, but there are a great number, too, that will need some support at some point during their young life. It is a matter of understanding that they can pick up some information or look for that information remotely and that the answer will be simple. Behind that, there might be a plethora of answers, resources, funding, specialisms, experts, all ready to deploy that, but the front of it, and the window to this, must be simple and uncomplicated.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lord Freeman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> We do not have it?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Shilpi Akbar</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: No, and the reason for that is because young people, and some adults, have to find the funding, and the funding sits in different places in different departments and you access it in different ways. What needs to happen is the funding should follow the person according to the needs that they need to overcome or there might be a skills barrier they need to overcome. That complexity is far too great at the moment. There is a plethora of disparate, fragmented, piecemeal provision and the landscape is unclear.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lloyd Broad</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: Perhaps I could add something to that, my Lord Chairman. I think this is the opportunity that now faces us with a new seven-year programme of EU investment funds being placed in the hands of local enterprise partnerships to develop their strategies. It is that local alignment that we are talking about in developing what we want to be one strategic economic plan for our territory, which is focused on people, place and business, that does demystify a very, very complex landscape but provides one single gateway to all, where what we see right now is what we describe as like a hub and spoke with a multitude of gateways for various types of support.

However, the current model that Governments are proposing is that you then filter that money through the national agencies that will do what you want them to do for you. Fundamentally, our problem over the past seven years was that the model of national agencies—like the Skills Funding Agency and the Department for Work and Pensions through Jobcentre Plus—operate regional contracting where they hand the money to prime contractors. Prime contractors can be from anywhere, so people from Liverpool parachute into Birmingham, try to deliver local training and employment, skills services and provision for our local people, but the problem we have is it never penetrates down deep enough to tackle the deep-rooted problems that we have.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Surely you have contacts at a level where you would be able to convince them that that is what they should be doing.

I think it is worth about £19 million in youth employment initiative funding in our local enterprise partnership area alone. What we want to do is co-invest that with other local provision. We want to build on successful programmes. There are successful programmes in our patch that are successfully targeting young people and doing good things with them. What we want to do is align the EU funding to that and build on the work of our youth commission, which has developed the Birmingham Jobs Fund. We developed the apprenticeship offer, which was the target of developing 1,000 apprenticeships in 100 days. We exceeded that. The YEI money has to be spent within the first two years, so we want to build it on what we know works in our area with the people that we know that can deliver in our area and effectively get what we call “shovel ready” programmes on the ground in January 2014.

What are you doing or going to do in that regard? Perhaps you can help us. We wish to do that as a Committee and it is very difficult for us to pick out and ask groups of young people to come along and tell us what it is all about.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Alex Conway</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: I asked around a little bit ahead because it was an interesting question. When it comes to skills-based or training-based schemes that you have ready-made, you have young people in school and you can ask them. Many contracts issued by the likes of the Skills Funding Agency will require that there is consultation as part of the package that is developed. The harder question to answer is what about these hard-to-reach youth that I was talking about earlier.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lord Cotter:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Yes.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Alex Conway</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: If you knew where they were, it would be easy.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> It would not be hard to reach.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Alex Conway</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: Even there, of course, in </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> we have a scheme that involves working with young offenders in Feltham Prison. Unfortunately, youth are in prison and you do know where to find them and you can do real targeted one-to-one work, which I think has been quite successful. Otherwise, I think it is a tricky one. Again, it comes back to having a multiplicity of approaches because we have found that when it comes to dealing with the hardest-to-reach groups, then charities that perhaps specialise in drug addiction or an ultra-local approach from a particular estate is how you might find your hardest-to-reach people. There is no easy answer. The </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> boroughs reminded me that you often have young mayors or youth councils.

What is your impression about how good the exchange of best practice is? How much is it used? The final bit of all that: are there gaps in the exchange of best practice information that ought to be filled in in some way?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lloyd Broad</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: I will answer that. Birmingham City Council was given intermediate body status to manage for the Department for Work and Pensions the transnational part of the ESF programme for the current programming period. We managed that as a national programme for the English regions in the last seven years. What we have found is that, in answer to your question, yes, there is good practice to be gleaned. What we need to do is develop a much more coherent and effective infrastructure that allows that sharing of knowledge, expertise and practice on an even footing.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Where we have had problems in the last seven years is that, again, it is a very fragmented landscape. Every single member state tackles ESF in a subtly different way. Therefore, their governance and their organisational arrangements and, indeed, their priorities will often differ. What we have been trying to do for this new programming period—and I have been doing this on behalf of DWP with other member states across Europe—is develop what we are calling a thematic common framework, a theme for example being youth unemployment, and allow member states to bring forward their approaches to tackling each of these different thematic areas, whether it is active ageing, youth unemployment and so on, and bring together ESF programmes from different member states so you are working on a very similar landscape and a very similar playing field. What we have found in the last seven years is there are an awful lot of things that you can learn from other places, whether it is Scandinavia and how they deal with active ageing, or whether it is Germany and how they deal with their apprenticeship programmes, or whether it is Italy and how they deal with some of their social policies. There is a lot of learning you can take from different places. What we need to do is develop a framework that allows that mutuality to thrive and where people can more effectively learn from each other. We are supporting this EU-level framework to allow LEPs within regions or former regions, territories, as well as member states to share their approaches of how they are using EU programmes to do just that. We are quite excited about how the new framework can facilitate and enable that mutual learning.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Where could this Committee find a list of best practice:  "Youth unemployment best practice—the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Netherlands</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> is terrific", and so on all the way down?

Even </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Birmingham</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">, with EU funding, has run a transnational project called Cities for Active Inclusion, which has involved eight or nine different cities around </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">.

It is a relative strength of EU-funded schemes that a lot of work is put both into transnational schemes and, indeed, their evaluation.

You are quite right. The local authority has lots of children in care. We have lots of children in care who present a huge complexity of issues. We have a statutory duty for young NEET people and unknowns, and often we have the duty but not the resource to act on our own and we have to work in partnerships.
