</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Thank you very much for that.  As I say, we are not used to such a large panel.  We have a lot of questions; we will try to be brief—and that is to my colleagues.  We will try to be brief in our questioning, and I ask you to be detailed but brief and to the point in your answers, so that we can get through everyone.  Please do not feel that every one of you has to answer every question—some will be more relevant to some than to others.  That is the only way we are going to get through this session in the time allocated.  If I can start with a question to you, Gavin, it is around the whole issue of the benefits cap.  I understand you did a survey of Haringey.  What did it reveal about the benefits cap’s impact on households?  What types of households were particularly impacted and in what ways?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gavin Smart</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Thank you.  We did some work looking at the experience of the benefit cap between April and August.  We found that in Haringey 747 households had been capped at that point.  Nearly half of them were in the private rented sector; 40% of them were in temporary accommodation; the rest were local authority and housing association.  We discovered that, although those households had been capped, they were still benefiting from discretionary housing payments and from council tax support, so the effect of the cap was being muted, but there were questions about the long-term implications of the cap once those support mechanisms disappeared.  We also found that people understood the work incentive that the cap is supposed to deliver, and by that I mean tenants and their advisers, but the movement into work was much more difficult.  Of those 747, only about 11% managed either to move into employment or to increase their hours to more than 16 hours.  It shows you the distance from the labour market that people are.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:35.6pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q77 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> When you said that a number of them still depended on other sources of income, such as through the local authority through the discretionary housing payment, does that mean that the savings to the taxpayer were not as great as they might have first appeared? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gavin Smart</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think it does.  On the face of it, the benefit cap was saving Haringey about £60,000 a week in terms of benefit expenditure.  That is only about 1.2% of their total benefits bill.  However, if you then look at the fact that people are receiving discretionary housing payments and the amount of time and money being invested either by the council or by their landlords in terms of support and advice services, it is clear that there was an element </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">of cost coming in through the backdoor and/or cost shunting to other organisations.  The savings are not as great as one might imagine.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gavin Smart</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: No, not to that degree.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt"> Can you extrapolate from what you found in Haringey to the rest of the country or the rest of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, or is a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> borough quite different from what is happening elsewhere in the country?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gavin Smart</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: You could certainly expect that the pattern that you see in Haringey would not be dissimilar from the pattern you see in other </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> boroughs.  About half of those people affected by the benefit cap are in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">; 20 of the most affected areas are </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> boroughs.  There are a lot of similarities in terms of the labour markets and in terms of the characteristics of tenant households.  I think that the Haringey report does tell you something about what might happen, certainly in the rest of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and perhaps in the rest of the country.  In the rest of the country, though, the cap is more likely to bite as a result of large families, whereas in Haringey about three-quarters of the people affected had either three or four children, so were not the extremely large families that some people would be talking about.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt;

font-size:12pt"> You did say that 40% were in temporary accommodation, and I know </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Aberdeen</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> might be slightly different, but in my own area almost all who are affected by the benefits cap are in temporary accommodation.  It reflects the high costs of temporary accommodation rather than just necessarily the cost of accommodation in more general terms.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gavin Smart</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think that is right.  You are right there is a similarity there with the Haringey experience.  Haringey gives us some early signs about the kinds of households that might be capped in different geographies, but also the challenges of responding to the cap, and the degree to which people are currently dependent on discretionary housing payments.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt"> What are people’s choices?  If they are already in temporary accommodation, in Haringey and affected by the cap, what can they do about it?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Gavin Smart</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Ideally you need to be able to move somewhere with a lower rent, but it is difficult to achieve that at speed with quite a constrained housing supply, and particularly social housing stock.  Then it is about the degree to which people are able to find access to work, ideally for more than 16 hours a week.  The Haringey results showed that people understood that, but only about 11% of people managed to make that change in the time that we were carrying out the work.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

they are trying to find work, but the work that they are likely to find is probably likely to be low-paid, which might not take them out of benefit.  In fact, probably it invariably will not.  We have case studies where people have two and three jobs and are working full time, but they are still on housing benefit because the level of wage that they are getting is still not enough to meet their housing costs.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

For some of our tenants, the support networks have been generated over 40 or 50 years.  People were born, brought up there and have always lived there.  All their childcare arrangements and everything are dependent on local family and friends.  That is what enables them to work: someone picks the children up from school so they can get home at five o’clock.  Someone takes the children to school.  We are doing it.  We talked about it ourselves.  We are all doing it.  We are all looking at parents and grandparents.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

or they are currently occupying specialist accommodation built as two-bed accommodation but specifically aimed at that client group.  Does it make sense to move people out of that?  There are lot of arbitrary impacts having drawn the line in the way that it is drawn.  The other observation I would make is that the weakness of the size criteria as a set of rules is that it effectively targets space and not cost, which is why it does not necessarily deliver savings.  If the motivation were savings, you would perhaps have started somewhere else.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Teresa Pearce:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Just on the discretionary housing payment, my constituency is in two separate London boroughs, and I could not get any handle from one of them on how they worked out who would get it and who would not.  It was completely arbitrary.  On challenge to them about how much they had spent, they had actually under-spent their discretionary housing payments, so now they are actually going back and revisiting people they have refused and giving them the money.  I just wondered: do you know of any of the boroughs you work in whether they have actually under-spent on the discretionary housing payment and whether or not on challenge you could get them to do that at all?  I did it in a borough that I do not normally have much success in.  The problem for me, and I would be interested to know from you, Danny, is whether, when people get awarded discretionary housing payment, do they understand that that is a reprieve and not a solution?  I have had people turned down and then allowed, and they now think the process has gone away.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt"> Clearly, there will be quite a big change when we move to universal credit beyond the pilot stage we are at now.  It has been done to try to simplify the system, but also to try to ensure that the individual who is receiving the benefit is beginning to take more control and responsibility for the money they are receiving.  When they move back into a world of work, that would be the way that the system would work, so I believe that is the intention behind it.  Clearly, for those who otherwise would historically have received the rent direct, as in the housing associations, etc., it changes the position for you.  What problems do you foresee and what steps have you already taken to deal with this?  You have talked about education and it seems to me that is actually a relevant issue here.  So, thoughts about the problems and, given that you know it is coming, thoughts about what steps you have taken and the size of the problem would be really valuable.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Duncan Forbes</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Perhaps I can pick up that first because we are in one of the areas that has a DWP demonstration project on direct payments, one of six areas in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, and we provide about nine-tenths of the housing within that demonstration project.  We have been involved in that for a year and a half, so we have a lot of information on how it works.  The key things are that on the basis that that is going to happen as part of universal credit, it is absolutely essential that we support people not to fail and we exempt people who will definitely fail, or we think will definitely fail.  Those are the two key challenges: what are those categories?  How do you define them to make sure that people are not put into a situation where they fail?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">To be honest, the motive is to get people into work and that is fine, but actually the more we hit people and fail them, the less likely they are to be strong enough, to have the self-esteem and confidence to get into work.  It has an opposite effect if we are not careful.  It is really important that together we build a process that will work.  To be fair, the DWP has listened to the experience we have had.  31% or so of our tenants predicted they would struggle, basically, on a long-term basis, not just on a short-term transitional basis.  30-odd per cent have moved out of the system, back on payments to us because they have got into such arrears that they were going to lose their tenancy if they were not brought back into payment of the rent to us.  We have quite a big cohort we need to do a lot of support work with.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt"> Can you clarify how you define the difficult people?  You have these two camps: the ones where they would cope and the ones, effectively where they would not cope and you are putting them in a position to fail.  Can you describe them?  You have to some extent quantified them and then, I guess, given what you have said, which is that you have then stepped in or the arrangement has been changed to the old system, so you get paid direct.  What further steps have then been taken to try to help them back into the new scheme?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Duncan Forbes</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I can.  There is a massive amount of extra support going in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">in</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> order to support this group of people, both the ones we are trying to move back in, but also the ones who are still in.  Broadly speaking, we had nearly 1,000 tenants in the project in the beginning, and about 300 have moved back into payments to us, leaving about 600 in the scheme at the moment who are getting intensive support, in some cases, to stay in.  Others are absolutely fine with it; they are managing it without any trouble at all.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The challenge is that none of the projects or researchers involved with the projects have been able to come up with a risk model that says a certain category of person is not going to succeed.  That is the real challenge, because we have to predict that in order to support the right people.  It is more of an art rather than a science.  The minute you set a set of regulations that says, “A person with these characteristics is exempt and a person with those isn’t,” it is a blunt instrument.  What we are finding is a whole series of different people are not succeeding for different reasons.  We really have to have that personal one-to-one support to understand what is going on in that person’s life and household in order to understand whether they are likely to succeed or not.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-weight:bold">Duncan Forbes</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Obviously, the biggest reason is that there is insufficient household finance, and of course the size criteria affect that as well, to cope with the payments out that are needed.  By the time you have taken off heating and eating, children’s clothing and so on and so forth, there are absolutely minimal amounts left.  I am sure Danny has some examples of where he has done some money advice with families and he can talk about the tiny amounts left at the end of the week, if any.  There is that issue and there are obviously issues around disability.  There are big literacy issues in some cases.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt"> I appreciate that we all live in more challenging times, whether we are on the benefit system or whether we are in the private sector.  Given that we are all having to manage with less, how are you actually helping these individuals budget?  In a sense you can buy a child’s clothes in Store A and Store C for completely different price ranges.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Duncan Forbes</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Our support workers are in there day in, day out.  That is what the team does.  They have one-to-one conversations on all sorts of aspects of how people can save money and they can budget differently.  You can buy at different stores, but if you do not have IT, you cannot buy online so you do not get those discounts, and it often costs £6 on a bus to get to a cheaper store.  By the time you have got there you have actually spent more money than if you had bought it down the road.  That is the difficulty.  Again, there is a lot more complexity to managing on a minute budget. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We have discovered that some of the best financial experts I have ever met in my life are some of our tenants, managing on the amounts they have in their budget.  We should not underestimate how skilled people are at managing their money, but they are managing on a weekly basis not a monthly basis.  Weekly you can cope, because if you miss a meal or you run out of money, you miss one meal in a week.  If you do that in a month, you miss out on a day and a half’s meals.  That is actually quite a lot, so it does make a difference and that is what is happening in some cases: people are not eating or often the parents are not eating in order to feed their children.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-weight:bold">Hardie</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: One of the major problems we have is everyone thinks the risk people would be those with alcohol or substance misuse.  Yes, they would be.  One of the big problems is the household who would normally cope and be very responsible, and a washing machine or a tumble dryer breaks down.  Although I go to them and say, “I can get you a grant.  I can get you an interest-free loan,” they are saying to me, “Danny, I need to use that washing machine tonight.  I’ve got to get my partner’s clothes ready for work.  I need to get school clothing ready.  I can’t wait a week.”  If I’m not able to really push them, “No, let’s go to the launderette; let’s sort that out,” they will go and get a pay-day loan or, with direct payment, they will think, “I’ll use the rent money and I’ll catch up.”  Every time I see someone with debts, it has been, “Well, I just dipped into a bit of this and I thought I’d catch up, and it’s all overwhelmed me over time.”  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt"> Can I come back to you, Duncan?  What steps can we actually take, once you have taken the decision to go back again, to then educate, and how long will it take to get people back onto being able to get paid directly through the universal credit?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Duncan Forbes</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think everybody is different.  That will be the real skill: to design a system where the timetable is about the individual—with a policy objective, fine—but actually taking people there as quickly as they can, but at a speed they can manage, where they are going to succeed.  If we want everyone to succeed in that arrangement and survive, we have to have the household sustainability, which we all do.  Some people will take a long time because they need a lot of work on skills, a lot of work on money management and a lot of work on help with household budgeting, and other issues; some need no help at all.  It is a total, continuous gradient and that is the challenge because we are trying to design a national system.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Can I just make one other quick point?  It is around the criticality of the sharing of information between the Department for Work and Pensions and us.  At the moment we are in a very strong partnership in our demonstration project and the housing benefit is part of that too, so we get a huge amount of information from housing benefit about what is happening within households on their income.  That enables us to intervene quickly if people need support.  At the moment, as we move to universal credit there are some conversations going on and there is not an expectation from the DWP that they will really be sharing any information with us.  I can see the logic of that from the point of view of the policy objective to make people independent, but is there a consequence of that that those people who are struggling with that independence do not get the support they need quickly enough?  By the time we get in, they will be four weeks in arrears, and that is a slippery slope.  We will not hear about it until we do not get our rent a few days after they get the money from the benefits system.  Our systems will only flag up the need five weeks ahead.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt"> Anne-Marie, do you mind terribly if I chip in here?  This is something that I have been talking about in this Committee since the general election. Direct payments were introduced previously by Labour.  I had real concerns there.  The Coalition has sort of expanded it and I still have real concerns.  The Select Committee drilled down on that quite a lot.  </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We could not get the shift out of that that I would have liked, but what we did get, which I want to sense</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">-</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt"> if they identified particular families or people likely to have challenges receiving the direct payments</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Duncan Forbes</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: No, that is still the DWP’s commitment.  They have learnt the lessons from the demonstration project along with us and seen that there are groups of people who are not coping with it brilliantly and who will need either long-term or short-term support in some cases.  There are others who are perfectly fine and will be transferred to it without a blip.  As I say, the challenge is predicting which groups those are and making sure we fund, because at the moment we are having our support costs paid by the Department for Work and Pensions.  We cannot not provide that support.  Only a small fraction of our working-age tenants are in that project.  We will have to deal with a whole cohort of our working-age tenants moving to universal credit.  There is a big cost and it is not just a short-term cost.  There is a short-term transitional cost for many more people, but actually 20% to 30% of people need long-term support to stay in that system.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Carol Matthews</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is exactly as Mr Lloyd says.  We have been talking sector-wide to the DWP about the way in which the universal credit system could succeed.  Our concern is that the results coming from the demonstration pilot that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Duncan</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has unpacked are that the scale of tenants having to go back into the direct payments system will actually overwhelm the alternative payment arrangements.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">One of the suggestions from the Social Market Foundation is that, if we set up something like a benefit portal that looks like a banking system but does not have the charges that tenants face, it would allow tenants to make conscious, rational choices about how they administer their benefit payments on a monthly basis: paying their rent, paying their council tax, paying their water rates, and paying their energy costs.  In our research, we have found that 27% of our tenants who have bank accounts face charges in the last quarter.  As a result, they are they are choosing to live on a hand-to-mouth cash existence.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Back to your point about what we are doing to support customers, we have had significant success in helping residents to open bank accounts, credit union accounts, access affordable credit and learn how to save, budgeting, household skills.  However, we still currently have 15% of our tenant base that does not have a bank account, and we are working with them.  We have to ensure that, if we want people to be independent and to take responsibility—and I do not think anybody on this side of the table would disagree with that—then the systems and the tools have to be set in such a way that people can use them to succeed.  Our real concern is that the scale of people, just on the basis of the under-occupation penalty, will overwhelm the alternative payment arrangements very quickly.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The other thing I would remind the Committee of is that the number of sources of this advice is getting smaller.  Legal Services Commission funding for things like Citizens Advice has significantly reduced; Supporting People payments are reduced; I know of a Citizens Advice Bureau that has just had to take the decision that it will make redundant 10 of its 15</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">advisers and it will continue to employ the other five only on a loss-making basis.  They will fund it from reserves for as far as they can.  The burden falls on a smaller and smaller group of organisations, typically landlords, who are doing a lot, but you have already heard the opportunity cost of that is it means there are other things the landlords do not do as a result of pushing money in to supporting tenants.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

we are doing job placements; we are changing the entry points into Riverside, so not only are we helping people into other employment, we are employing more people from our communities, whether it is in environmental teams or some of our entry-level jobs.  It is about 50%.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

for example, we have had someone who grew up in the care system, was sexually abused in care and became a parent himself.  He is now being abused by his son and is as far away from the labour market as it is possible to be and is probably never likely to be employed.  There are a good many, although not with those circumstances, who exhibit some of those characteristics.  Women fleeting domestic violence are another large group.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;
