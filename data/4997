Initially there were plausible explanations as to why this might be the case, but the disparity has continued to grow over the subsequent years to the point where multiple scenarios acting in concert now have to be invoked to maintain any possible correlation between observed vCJD cases (both primary and secondary) and vCJD prevalence as consistently observed in increasingly large retrospective LRT studies [3,4]. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">(3)</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The Department of Health have produced two reports both prior and subsequent to the Gill et al., 2013 publication [5,6]  which clearly identify this anomaly and discuss them at length. They provide the most comprehensive analyses to date of models describing the potential secondary transmission of vCJD via blood and blood components and show that many of these generate grossly implausible numbers for both present and future vCJD cases and have done so for some time. The calibration of potential models provided within is invaluable since it greatly narrows down the characteristics of the plausible and allows the implausible to be quickly weeded out. A credible transmission model needs to produce scenarios that are consistent not only with the number of blood-borne vCJD cases seen so far, but also with the number of primary cases seen and with the vastly higher level of putative carriers in the population.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-variant:small-caps">(4)</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-variant:small-caps"> A model meeting the above requirements – an hypothesis </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Current models assume that some, many or all vCJD infected individuals in the UK population (approx.1 in 2000, assuming 100% detection) as indicated by retrospective lymphoreticular prion immunohistochemistry will go on to develop the disease and in the interim present an infection risk to all those exposed to their blood and tissues.

There would, therefore, have been infected and potentially infectious individuals unwittingly donating putatively vCJD infected blood into an essentially unprotected UK blood supply. Subsequent to this a series of protective measures have been introduced, including withdrawal of all blood components, plasma products or tissues obtained from any individual who later develops clinical vCJD to prevent their use (1997) and leucodepletion (1999) [8]. Why so few cases?  </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">(6)</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">All three “implicated” transfusions were from MM-homozygotes and took place between 1996 and 1999, prior to the implementation of leucodepletion. Given that approximately six million units of blood would have been transfused over this period and perhaps 1 in 2000 would have come from vCJD infected codon 129 MM homozygotes, why have we not seen 3000 secondary vCJD cases via blood transfusion arising from this period rather than 3 cases only? Significantly all three cases had incubation periods of 5-8 years following transfusion and no vCJD cases via blood transfusion have been recorded in the subsequent 15 years. One scenario is that leucodepletion and other blood supply protection measures have been 100% effective, but this does not explain the paucity of vCJD cases arising between 1996 and 1999 unless there was no vCJD infectivity in the blood of the overwhelming majority of donations. The hypothesis proposed above explains both the three early iatrogenic cases – blood donations from donors actively incubating vCJD into recipients who were unfortunate enough to be susceptible both to the disease </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; text-decoration:underline">and</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> unsuccessful in clearing a low infectious dose exposure (as per the primary vCJD cases) and the greatly higher numbers either successfully clearing a low infectious dose exposure and remaining uninfected or, at an intermediate level  (&gt;/= 1:2000), being infected but successfully sequestering the infectious agent from the blood transfusion exposure into the lymphoreticular system and entering a long-term stable carrier state.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">(7)</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Apart from the susceptibility to developing actual clinical disease associated with the codon 129 MM phenotype present in 40% of the population, this model involves an essentially stochastic infectious process and is therefore compatible with both the lack of any clear familial or geographic associations in the primary vCJD cases observed in the UK. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">(8)</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Why should such a protective mechanism have been present to prevent a potentially massive vCJD epidemic?  Two alternative linked possibilities are immediately apparent: (a) serendipitously the vCJD agent is lymphotrophic unlike most prion agents. (b) during mammalian and human evolution such exposures will undoubtedly have occurred multiple times given the propensity of prion agents to cross species, genus, family and even order barriers. Recent recorded human history has seen the apparent appearance of “outbreaks” of new prion diseases in both man (Kuru,, iCJD, vCJD) and animals (Scrapie, TME, CWD, BSE, SEER and FSE), so it is unlikely that this is an isolated phenomenon. TSEs causing disease or death during the reproductive lifetime of the species concerned would have had reduced genetic fitness and evolution would have selected those variants better adapted to avoid premature death. This is, however, almost incidental to the more pressing questions </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">of how best to prevent further vCJD deaths and how to do this as cost-effectively as possible given that such cases are predicted to be exceedingly low according to the above hypothesis, which much better explains the evidence accrued to date on vCJD transmission and actual </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> cases.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">(9)</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Does this mean that UK blood, tissue and organ protection measures are redundant and can now be discontinued? Back in 2005 I wrote a paper for Health Protection Matters applauding the precautionary approach adopted by the UK regulatory authorities [9]. I believe that these measures should now be revisited for their effectiveness, not only in terms of overall morbidity and mortality but also for their cost effectiveness compared to other health protection measures. There is not an insignificant danger that while some measures are still prudent, inexpensive or have other benefits and should be retained (e.g. leucodepletion) other measures are both extremely costly but also very likely counter-productive (e.g. US sourced plasma where its method of procurement by payment rather than voluntary donation may mean that it has more potential to be contaminated by blood from intravenous drug users and have an increased infectious or illegal substance load. I am not an expert in this area and each SaBTO measure should be reviewed by those that are in light of my hypothesis and its implications. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">(10)</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">I do not believe the UK regulatory authorities have missed any measures in use in other countries worldwide that should have been employed in the UK.

In my view, some UK committees have been overly bureaucratic in their attempts to be comprehensive and this may have slowed down decision making at times, but it has not resulted in incorrect or ill-advised decisions being made.  </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-variant:small-caps">Recommendation</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">I recommend that my very recently formulated lymphoreticular sequestration hypothesis considered and developed in response to the Parliamentary Science and Technology Committee’s call for written submissions relating to vCJD transmission is scrutinised as a matter of some urgency by experts in the field.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">January 2014</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 8pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-variant:small-caps">References</span></p><ol type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.25pt; padding-left:4.75pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Hilton DA, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Ghani</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> AC, Conyers L, Edwards P, McCardle L, Ritchie D, Penney M, Hegazy D, Ironside JW.
