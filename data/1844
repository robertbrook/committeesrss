There are many examples  of local authorities who are leveraging part of their spend via procurement hubs, thus securing long term service and cost benefits for local tax payers and their local economies. It is noticeable however that such examples do not permeate throughout the system, accounting for only 15% of procurement spend. A  mind-set of independence and local sovereignty prevails, preventing many councils from obtaining value for money through collaborative arrangements and preventing many collaborative arrangements and organisations from achieving the full potential of benefits for their users due to being unable to use the full power of local government procurement spend to manage suppliers and markets, taking out cost from supply chains. Therefore, those authorities that fail to maximise their use of collaborative opportunities cost all authorities a lot of money.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">To what extent is local government procurement organised to deliver value for money and social, economic and environmental objectives, including stimulating the local economy? To what extent are local authorities achieving the involvement of local residents in delivering value for money? To what extent are local authorities able to develop long-term relationships with contractors?</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><h1 style="margin:0pt; page-break-after:avoid; page-break-inside:avoid; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">CIPS Response</span></h1><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Often local government procures from national and increasingly global supply markets for goods and services but the will to support such complexity is highly fragmented and all too often operates independently from its neighbouring authorities and other public sector bodies such as health and higher education. The result is that nationally collaborative procurement represents only 15% of total spend with price, risk and service benchmarks across common areas of spend becomes a complete blind spot. So despite the globalisation, local government all too often has a ‘corner shop’ mentality in its approach to procurement. Typically the focus also remains on savings and despite the Social Value Act of 2012, there is little evidence at a national level that social, economic and environment considerations are duly regarded in the selection and award of contracts. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">To counteract this fragmentation, local authorities should be investing heavily in the resources necessary to drive value for money procurement and appropriate levels of contract and supplier performance management with trained professionals. Seemingly they cannot afford to do so. As a result procurement often lacks the critical mass, authority or independence to influence strategic areas of spend despite the fact that a neighbouring authority or collaborative procurement hub may have the resources and interest to act on their behalf. The impact on an authority’s ability to manage contracts and supplier performance in an increasingly complex outsourcing and PFI environment is of major concern.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="2" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Do authorities take sufficient advantage of collaborative and joint procurement opportunities, including those available from central government?

We have seen many examples of commercially unfavourable PFI contracts that would have benefited from a centre of excellence approach, where suitably experienced and qualified procurement personnel could be contracted in to provide independent commercial advice to the local team. Thereby reducing the risk of the many pitfalls that can easily be spotted by trained procurement professionals.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">As mentioned above, it is estimated that only 15% of local government spend is channelled through collaborative and joint procurement initiatives. Significant progress has been made by organisations such as YPO, ESPO and NEPO in terms of leveraging regional spend opportunities across multiple government entities including increased collaboration with central government via frame work agreements negotiated by the Government Procurement Service. If all local authorities made use of such organisations, there would be large efficiency improvements and better value for all. Those local authorities that are failing to make maximum use of such arrangements are damaging the finances of all.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="3" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">How can local authorities access the skills, expertise and capabilities to implement effective procurement strategies, including value for money and social and economic objectives? More specifically, does local government have sufficient understanding of its procurement expenditure and the markets for goods and services to deliver quality procurement strategies—locally and regionally. If not, how can deficiencies be addressed?</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><h1 style="margin:0pt; page-break-after:avoid; page-break-inside:avoid; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">CIPS Response</span></h1><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Too often basic information such as value of spend by category and supplier are unknown at a local, let alone national level. Added to the high degree of fragmentation, disparate systems, varied and often complex procedures for suppliers it is unlikely that local authorities command sufficient understanding of markets and the appropriate strategies to deploy within them to achieve value for money outcomes. There is some degree of under investment in experienced and qualified procurement resources but in some cases it may be impractical to build critical mass of procurement within each authority owing to limited scale of spend. Accessing these skills via a combination of collaborative procurement hubs, central government frameworks and perhaps more informal networks, such as centres of excellence, would provide a rapid and scalable solution for many authorities. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The work the LGA is doing within the construction area is a good example of how local authorities can access collaboration and best practice without the need to invest locally to build capability.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="4" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">To what extent is risk in local government procurement and contracting understood and managed and contracting strategies adopted, which are tailored to product and supplier market places?

The Southern Cross case demonstrated the tendency for local authorities to contract with </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">national operators without the appropriate amount of due diligence investigating the overall financial stability and operational performance of the parent company. Little knowledge of exposure to risk is understood at either a national or local level. The fragmented approach to procurement was an important factor in the failure of local government to manage the care home market, be aware of the potential difficulties with Southern Cross and to develop a strategy to mitigate them effectively resulting in unnecessary stress for vulnerable people.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Unfortunately procurement teams can lack the authority and sometimes the capability to offer independent advice to the service delivery teams in areas such as risk exposure and contracting methodology. Whilst developing this capability in house may be cost prohibitive owing to the frequency of major/high risk projects there are opportunities to leverage skills and capabilities in other local authorities, procurement hubs or centres of excellence. But, the will and understanding of the ‘go it alone’ mentality must first be recognised and challenged by senior management.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="5" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">How is regularity and propriety of procurement secured and are the arrangements for detecting and addressing impropriety and fraud effective? </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><h1 style="margin:0pt; page-break-after:avoid; page-break-inside:avoid; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">CIPS Response</span></h1><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">There is too much emphasis placed on detection, after the event, rather than prevention of fraud. There is a general lack of awareness of how fraudulent practice, both internal and external occurs, and how organisations can introduce controls to reduce risk. A major programme of education is required to address this important area of preventable loss. Fragmentation of procurement (different departments buying?) can exacerbate risks. The construction cartel, for which the Office of Fair Trading fined contractors to local government over £100m in 2008, illustrates this. It is likely that the true cost to local government was several times greater than this. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="6" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Is local authority procurement fully transparent, audited effectively and does it provide appropriate mechanisms for redress?

It is questionable whether many authorities would have suitable data for such reporting. However, this criticism would suggest that overall, and despite some excellent initiatives, local authority procurement is failing to provide overall value for money. Hence there can be no assurance that it is being obtained. Additionally, procurement teams can lack the authority, independence and sometimes the capability to offer independent advice so the commercial rigour of some projects may go unchallenged. Again the use of procurement hubs or centres of excellence can mitigate risk in this area and using trained individuals. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">September 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
