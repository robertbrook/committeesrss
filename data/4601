As you will be aware, the GMC is the independent regulator of the medical profession, and our role is to protect the public by ensuring high standards of medical practice. We keep a register and currently there are about 250,000 doctors on it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Since we last appeared we have introduced revalidation; we have opened a confidential helpline, which can be accessed by doctors who are finding it difficult to raise concerns in their place of work; we have published updated guidance on good medical practice and also, for the first time, guidance for patients on what they can expect from their doctor; and we have significantly influenced the next European medical directive.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Our work in revalidation, which is groundbreaking internationally, has attracted a lot of international attention, and a number of countries are looking and learning from what we are doing.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The last year has also seen, of course, the publication of very important reports—Francis, Berwick, Clwyd-Hart and Keogh—and we have been actively engaged in both giving evidence to those inquiries and responding to the recommendations.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">With regard to revalidation, we intended to revalidate around 20,000 doctors in the first year, and we have done that. We have revalidated just under 25,000 doctors. It is still early days, but we are very confident that revalidation will lead to both an improvement in medical practice overall but also, very importantly, much earlier identification of doctors who have problems with their practice.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Our new employer liaison service is working well across the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, with our employees working with medical directors to advise them both on revalidation but also, importantly, on performance issues with individual doctors and advice on what to do.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">With regard to language testing of doctors from elsewhere in the EEA, we know this has been a matter of great interest to the Committee. I am pleased to report that an amendment to the Medical Act will be introduced in April 2014 to give us the power to test the English language of doctors from elsewhere in the EEA.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I mentioned just now that we had been active in influencing the next European directive. Very significantly, we have achieved an agreement that every regulator in the EEA will have a legal duty to tell every other regulator within three days if they remove a doctor from their register. This has not been the case before. The GMC tells every regulator in the world when we take action against a doctor’s registration, and it is in the public domain on our website. That has not been the case elsewhere in the European Economic Area, and we are very pleased, as I am sure the Committee will be, that this will change with the new directive.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Very briefly, I have another couple of quick points. I mentioned the confidential helpline. We know that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">whistleblowing</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is difficult and that the track record of whistleblowers in the NHS is poor. We opened a confidential helpline a year ago this week, and we have had over 900 calls and initiated over 60 inquiries as a consequence of those calls.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In a national trainee survey we have begun asking trainees if they have concerns about patient safety; 5% did have concerns, and we followed up each and every one of those locally.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">To end, again very briefly, last time the Committee urged us to speed up our fitness to practise processes and aim for a target of concluding 90% of cases within 12 months. We have achieved that. In the last 12 months we have concluded 92% of cases.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service is up and running and now very well established. If there are any questions about that, Judge Pearl will be very pleased to answer them.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">My very last comment is about the upcoming Law Commission Bill, which offers us great opportunities to achieve greater streamlining of processes that we have aspired to for some time. Thank you very much for your time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q2 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Professor Sir Peter, thank you very much for that. I can let you know that we shall be asking questions on all of those points at some stage during the hearing. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">At the 2012 accountability hearing the GMC told the Committee that it had intervened in a number of locations around the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in the last year where it found that the standards of education and training had fallen below what it expected. What is the GMC doing to encourage registrants to highlight poor standards of care and raise concerns about the practice of their colleagues?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Niall Dickson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Obviously we recognise that this is an important area of work. As an organisation, we did recognise this before Francis, but that inquiry really highlighted it in a very major way. Before the last hearing, we issued new guidance both for mainstream doctors and for leaders within the medical profession about how they should both raise inquiries and respond to them. Over the last year we have been actively promoting that guidance. It is all very well producing guidance; it is another thing to get people to live by it, which was one of the challenges this Committee and others put to us around Mid Staffordshire, because it was clear that doctors were not following our guidance in raising concerns. Some did raise concerns but there was a culture within that institution of not raising concerns.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The question is: how do we go about trying to help this? Setting up the confidential helpline is important in two ways. First, it sends a signal to the profession that we are open to this and want to encourage it, but, secondly, it is also a vehicle whereby, as Sir Peter said, we have opened up more than 60 serious investigations as a result of doctors contacting us on that helpline. As Sir Peter touched on, we have also used the national training survey. Again, it is partly about collecting information from doctors about safety concerns, but it is also about sending a signal to them and indeed to the whole system that the raising of concerns by professionals is a routine and important part of professional life.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We have sticks in our bag, but an awful lot of what we have to do is to work alongside hospitals, employers and medical organisations in encouraging a change of culture. We know that, even within one hospital, it can vary. One team is quite easy and people can find it quite easy to raise concerns; in another it is much more difficult. The challenge for us going forward—and we are looking at this now—is about forming alliances at national level but also continuing our work at local level. We now have a small regional liaison team that comprises 12 to 14 individuals working at regional level. They are having meetings with doctors, groups of doctors, patient groups and others, and at the core of this is a conversation about how you challenge culture and enable people to feel that they are able to speak up.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q3 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> That is very interesting; thank you for that. You have your confidential helpline, but if I am a registrant who is considering reporting concerns and making a complaint, what happens when I pick up the phone? How do I do this now, and why is the system improved?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Niall Dickson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: If you are talking about referring to us, we have changed that as well. One of the reasons we are getting so many more complaints is that we have made it easier for people to fill out the online complaint form. If someone phones up our call centre, we will help a patient, doctor or anybody else and take them through the process of making that complaint. The bigger challenge, frankly, is not so much how easy it is to get there when you contact us. We receive an awful lot of complaints—for example, from patients—that we are not able to deal with; in other words, they are not for us. As the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Clywd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">-Hart report recognised, the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">system is still far too complicated and there are far too many variables at local level for people to find their way through the system.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The things that we can act on are at the more serious end. Most complaints and issues around doctors on a day-to-day basis should be dealt with effectively at local level. We have to make sure, first, that the route to us is absolutely clear and people can see that route, and, secondly, that people understand at local level that they can raise a concern without it affecting their career.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q4 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> If it is </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">too</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> complicated, what exactly would you like to see changed? Can you be specific about the changes you would like to see occurring?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Niall Dickson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I am anxious not to step on others’ toes, but one of the areas on which we are going to have discussions with NHS England is how you make sure that when a patient raises a concern there is an easy place for them to go to. For a long time there has been a lot of talk about creating a hub where individual complaints could go. We have said that we are happy to take part in those conversations, and we would certainly be happy to re-signal people towards that if they ended up in the wrong place with us. The challenge has always been that, if you create a hub, there is a danger of creating another ecumenical church, as it were; you create another place for people to go rather than where everybody goes. There is no doubt in my mind—Clwyd-Hart reflects this—that sorting this out at local level, making sure people know where to go as a first step and that it is effective is one of the biggest challenges. There are places that do it really well; there are others that do not.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q5 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You have touched on the Francis report, as did Sir Peter earlier on.

The fact that 5% of doctors are using the survey to raise their concerns and a significant number had not raised that concern locally indicates that there is still a challenge. If you talk, as we do, to groups of doctors in training, they will tell you that if you go into a team—I am not talking necessarily about anything major—the key point is that you should feel able to point out even the minor within that team. There is still a challenge culturally within medicine and other professions about feeling able, no matter where you are in the hierarchy, to raise that matter. We think that some of the people who phone up our confidential helpline simply want to say, “If I raise this, what will happen?” They just want a bit of assurance. They can read the guidance that tells them who to go to at local level and what steps to take, what to record and when to do it. All that is absolutely clear, but people just want assurance because when they do it </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">it</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> can feel very risky.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Sir Peter Rubin</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Can I just comment on the culture within an organisation? We are saying to trainees that we are interested in knowing whether they have concerns about patient care. It may be that they are not being asked.

If a doctor raises a concern—blows the whistle, if you will—often the doctor who blows the whistle ends up being investigated. The GMC goes to the medical trust director and says, “Is everything all right here?” and is told, “Everything’s fine; there’s nothing to see here. Who raised the concern?” The GMC names the doctor, and they say, “Oh, yes. Well, Dr So-and-so has some mental issues.” Lo and behold, a little while later they get referred to the GMC on a personal thing—instability or inappropriate conduct. That is the story we have seen over the last decade.

Now that you have reminded me, I also saw the submission that you mentioned, and I had forgotten seeing it. In a case like that, we would be very interested in going in at a high level and inquiring of that organisation, without naming any names, “Can we look at your processes? Can we see how robust they are? Can we look at your record keeping?” This is what we do. We do a lot of investigation. If there are doctors who have concerns about this, we would like to know.

We should and do take an entirely neutral position as far as allegations made to us are concerned. Within the confines of what we are able to do, we try to the best of our ability to establish what has happened and, if necessary, put that to a panel, where sometimes it is argued out between both sides.

The complainant who is doing that will eventually have to give evidence against the other doctor, if it is of that nature. If a doctor does not want to give their name, it is very difficult for us.

They are not trying to be pro-doctor, pro-medical director or whatever. They are trained so that they are not biased in any way, and we have rigorous processes to try to make sure our system is the best. Could it be better? Of course it could, and we are constantly looking at ways in which we can make it faster, because there is a lot of pressure to try to speed up the process, but we also have to make sure it is as fair as it possibly can be to all those who are involved in what is inevitably, or quite inevitably, a traumatic experience.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q15 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Charlotte Leslie:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> If the Chair will </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">indulge</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> me, I would value a short answer because we have limited time.

Medicine is a risky business. The very best doctors will be willing to take reasonable risks and will be very good at dealing with uncertainty.

If a case is referred to the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service for an adjudication, the first stage that is gone through is to make findings of fact. Once the tribunal has made a finding of fact, before it can impose any sanction, it needs to make a finding that that is both serious misconduct and that as a result of it the doctor is impaired, so the question of impairment comes in. It is at that point that issues such as remediation, for example, very much take centre stage, and the panel is trained to consider just the sorts of issues you raise about how a reasonable doctor would have behaved when faced with that particular set of circumstances.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q19 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrew George:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you use peer review?

The way we measure the general practitioner, for example, is to get two general practitioners to look at that behaviour and say, “Is this within the bounds of competence?” Obviously, if it is misconduct, it is slightly easier to make a judgment about it, but, if it is a question of professional competence, we would use their peers to provide an analysis of whether or not it was reasonable.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q20 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrew George:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> When you do that, do you make sure that the peer review is nameless, for example, so that it is not coloured by knowing the person they are being asked to judge?

I was thinking of doing this. Is that the right thing? To whom should I talk? Should I talk to the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Royal</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">College</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">? Can you clarify a piece of your guidance?” There is a range of things that they will raise. The cases that we have opened are ones where they are making a serious allegation about another doctor and their behaviour, and that is why we have opened up the investigation.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q22 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Wollaston:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The point about anonymity is important.

We wanted to make a helpful move by opening the confidential helpline, and we have done that; it has been going for a year. You are both making really important points, to which we cannot give you a straight answer at the moment, but we recognise the importance. We want to ensure that we know about issues where patient safety information is being </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">suppressed locally. That is what the confidential helpline is for. If we have not got it right, or if we can do things to make it easier for a doctor to progress a complaint, we will learn from the analysis, and we have taken on board the points you are both making.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q23 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Charlotte Leslie:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I know that the group Patients First, which has been supporting whistleblowers, indicated in its evidence to us that it was rather disappointed that the GMC had not taken up its recommendations and held a meeting, or its offer to work in partnership to see how the GMC could better support whistleblowers, particularly in view of the tragic incidence of suicides and deaths of doctors under fitness to practise and the fact that blowing the whistle can be very traumatic and stressful if somebody’s job is at stake, which is all too often the case. Will you be meeting Patients First and taking up its offer to look at some of its recommendations and experience of working with whistleblowers—not that you are in the stocks for anything?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Niall Dickson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We have had a number of meetings with Kim Holt and her colleagues. The door is always open, and we will have discussions. You mentioned the slightly separate but very important issue about doctors who commit suicide under our procedures. You will be aware—it is in our evidence—that, independent of any external pressure, we have set up a review to look at doctors who have taken their own lives within our procedures.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The reality is that many doctors, when they are referred to us, particularly under the health procedures, are suffering from quite serious mental health conditions. The process itself, as everybody recognises, can be very traumatic. We have already taken a quite significant number of steps to try to make it less traumatic for them. Any doctor within our health procedures has a workplace supervisor, who is another doctor. They are seen by two treating psychiatrists on behalf of the GMC, so we do take seriously our responsibilities—our duty of care, as it were. Over recent years we have ordered what we call a significant event review, which is the equivalent in the health service of a serious untoward incident, every time there is a death so that we try to learn the lessons from that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Our feeling was that there was a danger that you would just do that and say, “We did everything we could” and so on. We wanted to see if we could dig down a bit deeper to understand whether there was any more we could do. We now have a contract with Doctors for Doctors, which is the BMA support service. We offer that to all doctors who are part of our procedures. We have introduced a witness support programme that supports witnesses who are appearing both on behalf of the GMC but also on behalf of doctors. We have done some research with doctors who have been through our procedures about what it was like for them and so on, and we are about to do more work. We have had meetings with the practitioner programme on which Clare </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Gerada</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> works. We have worked closely with them on redesigning some of our materials.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">So we absolutely take this really seriously to see if there is anything we can do. We have to pursue patient safety. That is what you set us up to do; that has to be our first concern; but we recognise that often we are dealing with people who are in a very unhappy place even before they are referred to us.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">One other comment made by somebody from that programme is that they have met doctors who have said, “The GMC saved my life. Being referred in was a good thing because it meant I was able to alter it.” But we also recognise that what we do causes additional trauma, and we must do everything we can to try to deal with it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q24 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you run a suicide risk </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">assessment</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> on occasion?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Niall Dickson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There is an assessment by the two psychiatrists and the workplace-based supervisor, and they do highlight that. One of the things we are looking at through the significant event review is whether anybody was saying of these doctors, who were overseeing and looking after these patients, as well as the doctors’ treating psychiatrists—they frequently have that as well—that there were any signs that we could have done anything. Obviously, we are not in the local area when that is going on. All these people—the workplace supervisor, the treating psychiatrist and our two psychiatrists—are doing that, and, if any of our staff become aware of any issue where, for example, the doctor says, “I’m going to take my own life,” that would be an immediate trigger for us to do something; but a lot of the individuals who commit suicide are people in respect of whom we know there was a high risk—absolutely. That is the reality that people who work in mental health services face all the time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q25 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Wollaston:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I just wonder about changing the culture around complaints.

One of the things we can do and will do is that we are about to publish rates of referrals from individual trusts, so we are trying to expose all this data that we have had operationally for years but have never had the ability to section off and make sure is robust. The commentary we put on that is that a lot of referrals from a place does not mean it is bad; indeed, it could mean that its clinical governance arrangements, which are absolutely crucial for revalidation, are really rather good and they are able to do that, whereas with regard to somewhere where nothing is happening you might say, “Are they doing the job?” We have to put a caveat around all the figures that we are starting to put out. By putting out the figures, I hope we will start to have a grown-up debate about this.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Una Lane</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I endorse what Niall has said. On the one hand, where we see in some organisations a significant number of referrals to us from medical directors or other senior doctors, or a significant number of complaints, we may have the data, but the intelligence that sits behind it is probably something we do not have. It could mean that this is a good organisation that takes its responsibilities seriously around patient safety and care, making sure they are acting very swiftly in relation to individual doctors where there is cause for concern. On the other hand, it could mean that it is an organisation that is not taking its responsibility to deal with these matters locally as seriously as it should and is not responding adequately to patients who are raising issues with it. We are beginning to analyse and publish that data, but it is the beginning of a conversation around that and the beginning of an understanding of whether this can lead to genuine intelligence about these organisations rather than simply data which in and of themselves could mean a number of things.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q26 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We are going to be </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">moving</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> on to revalidation in a moment, but before we do I want to ask a couple of questions about emergency care and patient safety. The Health Committee produced a report in July in which we said that trainees and consultants alike found </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">working in emergency medicine to be relentless and demoralising. Do the findings of your survey of doctors in training support this description?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Niall Dickson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes, they do. Ours is a limited survey. We dipped into a number of trusts where we thought there might be some difficulties. We also, incidentally, went to two that were very good, because we think you can learn as much from places that do it well as those that are doing it badly. We have concerns. Recruitment in these areas is difficult; the experience of doctors in some of those trusts suggested that the pressures they felt were excessive.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q27 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Turning to patient safety, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">you</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> have said that one in 20</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">doctors in training have reported concerns connected with patient safety. Have you made an assessment of the proportion of these complaints that relate to emergency medicine?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Niall Dickson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I cannot give you an answer, and we will send a note to the Committee, but the answer is that one of the areas from the national training survey, for example, has been a concern about obstetrics and gynaecology and some of the relationships between professionals in that area. As a result of that, we will be doing another set of checks in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">obs</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">gynae</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> next year. One of the great advantages of the national training survey is that it gives you that kind of information.

In those circumstances, bearing in mind the example of the emergency departments and the pressures under which they sometimes find themselves, if you are identifying this as a trend and an area where errors are sometimes regrettably made, how do you engage with that and communicate any findings from it? As I understand it, it is your role to look at individual cases of individual professional competence to do the job, whereas it may well be that there is a systematic or resource issue that needs to be fed back and lessons learned, both at the individual hospital level but perhaps also in the health system or even at the political level. Do you see your role as ensuring that those lessons are learned, not necessarily by the individual doctor but by the system, the hospital and so on?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Sir Peter Rubin</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The answer is yes. You are quite right that we have a statutory duty to regulate individual doctors. Over the last few years, at least since Niall and I have been at the helm of the GMC, we have extended what we do quite widely. We have commissioned research and done the kind of surveys that you have been hearing about. We share the results of that very openly; it is all in the public domain. We see trends that will be of huge importance to NHS England and other organisations like that. I think we have a major role to play. We will soon be one of the few areas of health, or possibly the only one, that has a UK-wide perspective.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q29 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrew George:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You say you have a major role to play.

The other point to make is that we are an individual regulator, but we are also a system regulator in relation to education. Indeed, this is an education responsibility, so, if you take the national training survey, it is not </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">just a question of asking every doctor to write something down. This is fed back to every single local organisation. The deaneries then have to respond about what they are doing in their area and how they are dealing with it. They use this, and they see individual departments where they have difficulties. It is quite a fine and useful tool for people at local level to reflect on the kinds of pressures they are in. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The big change over the last year is in the system regulators. If you ask the CQC and Monitor, they will say that the national training survey is one of the most important measures of what is happening in hospitals. It has changed the behaviour of the CQC, which, when it makes inspections, now talks to groups of junior doctors and doctors in training. We have had that influence, and we will continue to do it. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">As to the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">obs</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">gynae</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> stuff, we will work with the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Royal</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">College</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and, once we have done those checks, we will absolutely draw it to the attention of Ministers and NHS England, but actually we can also talk to people at local level.

I, and perhaps the Committee, would like better to understand the role and relationship of the responsible officer. Perhaps I might start by asking Una and Niall, and maybe Professor Rubin as well, about the introduction of revalidation, and whether it has identified more failings in the practice of doctors compared with the old employer-led system. Is it your opinion that it has been able to pick up more failings in practice?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Sir Peter Rubin</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We do not have robust evidence to back this up. When responding to the Chair earlier, I said that the number of referrals from medical directors has gone up significantly year on year. My personal view is that revalidation had a major impact </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">before it even started, because effective systems of appraisal and so on were introduced in hospitals and identified people who needed to be referred. I think the impact antedated the introduction of revalidation by maybe three or four years.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Grahame M.

In some ways, given what Peter has said, certainly we have seen an increase in referrals to us, but in many other ways it is early days. It is going to be another two years before the vast majority of doctors are revalidated, and a further four years before all the remaining trainees are put through the process.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There is significant evidence that all health care organisations are now taking some of their local responsibilities more seriously. We see many more doctors who are subject to appraisal than was the case a number of years ago.

There is some evidence thus far that revalidation, in both its planning and introduction, is making a change, but by this time next year, when we come back before the Committee, hopefully we will have more robust, hard evidence about what is happening on the ground.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q33 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Grahame M.

We have introduced an attempt to encourage and put in place clinical governance arrangements that the health service said it had done about 10 years ago. The answer is that revalidation has acted as a significant catalyst both in terms of procedures but also as an awakening within the boards of hospitals and so on about their responsibility for ensuring the quality of the medical staff who work for them. That is a very basic responsibility, and revalidation is a wake-up call. It is still a wake-up call; we are not saying we are anywhere near the end. It is cultural change at local level that, in a way, is more important than the ticks that come through to us every five years. It is setting in place stuff at local level. You can talk to people at local level, and certainly our feedback from responsible officers is that this is a significant change.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q34 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Grahame M.

I would like to try to understand the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">relationship</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> or link between responsible officers and employee liaison officers. In terms of the numbers, is it the case that the local area teams of NHS England appoint only one responsible officer—I think there are 16 local area teams—to oversee the revalidation of GPs in their particular area?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Una Lane</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Shall I kick off on the role of the responsible officer? It is a relatively recent role and was introduced in regulations across the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in January 2011. It is important to remember that responsible officers are not creatures of the GMC. In many ways, their role existed already in health care organisations across the country. It was mainly a medical director role. The responsible officer’s role became a statutory one in an organisation, which effectively had been performed previously by a medical director.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The important thing about the role of the responsible officer is that the regulations that brought responsible officers into being place duties on organisations. They place a range of statutory duties on organisations to evaluate the fitness to practise of doctors; ensure that doctors have an appraisal; and ensure that they have proper and robust clinical governance </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">systems in place. The role of the responsible officer is effectively to be accountable for delivering the organisation’s duties in that respect.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">As to numbers, there are over 800 organisations across the four countries in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> that are designated—in other words, subject to these statutory duties. Therefore, we have over 800 responsible officers in total.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In relation to the restructuring of NHS England, we moved from having 10 strategic health authorities and over 150 primary care trusts—Sarah probably knows better than I do—to a situation where we now have four regional teams or sectors of NHS England and 27 local area teams. You are absolutely right that for GPs in England there would be one responsible officer in each of those local area teams, who is responsible not only for making revalidation recommendations to us but also for fulfilling all the statutory duties I mentioned a moment ago.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q35 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Grahame M. Morris:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you think the ratio is sufficient? At the very start of your evidence you quoted the numbers. Obviously, there is a proportion overseas who are on the register. That is a relatively small number of responsible officers not just for revalidation but to oversee general professional standards. In your opinion is that enough?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Una Lane</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The way I tend to look at the role of the responsible officer is that it is a function rather than an individual. I often compare it with chief executives of organisations. Niall is the chief executive of our organisation. We have 1,000 staff and contract with a further 1,500 people. It is about the resources that an individual has in place to support their function. It is not simply a numbers game; it is much more about whether the area teams provide the right and relevant resources to support responsible officers in delivering the statutory duties that fall on these organisations. That is probably a roundabout way of saying that it is about resources provided to the individual rather than necessarily simply about the numbers.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q36 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Grahame M. Morris:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What sort of feedback has there been from doctors about the performance of responsible officers and their capacity to provide the support and oversight required to be effective? Do you have any information on that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Una Lane</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Again, looking particularly at NHS England, there is no doubt that the restructuring presented some challenges. When we began revalidation back in December 2012, we had strategic health authorities and primary care trusts. Come 1 April, they disappeared and we had a whole range of new organisations that needed to take up the reins fairly swiftly. Peter probably knows a little better than I do and may be closer to it. Like everything else, the views of doctors are mixed. Some have very positive views about their experiences of appraisal and responsible officers locally; others have a slightly more negative view. I do not think there is a uniform or consistent view.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q37 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Grahame M.

We have very close relationships with responsible officers, but one of the things we want to track over the next number of years is exactly the areas that you are covering: how individual doctors are experiencing this locally, and what their experience is of the role of the responsible officer and appraisal. We are also developing what we call an evaluation framework. We are working very closely with an academic partner to try to evaluate better what we cannot see at national level to understand what is happening locally on the ground.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Niall Dickson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The profession’s views have probably changed over the last few years. Even three or four years ago there was a feeling that revalidation would never come. They had waited an awfully long time for it. There was probably a period when people said, “Oh, really; it is going to arrive,” and that would cause some antibodies among some. The impression you get is that the profession has now accepted that it is inevitable because it is here, and, as more and more people go through it and they are still alive at the other end of the process, some of the fear about it will also be overcome, but we have to see. We have said that we will adapt it as we develop and understand what the right model is.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Sir Peter Rubin</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Leading up to revalidation, there was a lot of noise in the medical press about it. The world was about to end, basically. Here we are a year on with nearly 25,000 doctors having been revalidated. That noise has gone. People have been revalidated; the world has not ended; they have survived the process. It has been accepted, as Niall said, that it is here and is working.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q38 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Grahame M.

Did you say there were 800 such organisations? Is it correct that the responsible officer is also responsible for working through low-level complaints and remediation with particular doctors? Could you elaborate on that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Una Lane</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Perhaps I could talk very briefly about responsible officers dealing with what may be complex but low-level complaints that do not require referral to the GMC, and whether they have processes in place to do that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Grahame M.

I mentioned a moment ago that all of these organisations have a statutory duty to evaluate their doctors, and make sure they have systems in place to identify emerging poor performance before it gets to the point of becoming an issue of patient safety or quality of care. If you look at some of the surveys that have been done with organisations over the last number of years, about half these organisations—even back in 2011—did not have formal processes and policies in place to deal with remediation, rehabilitation and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">reskilling</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in circumstances where they had identified emerging poor performance.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The most recent survey completed in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> indicates that in the region of 85% of these organisations now have those formal procedures and policies in place. Again, we think that the introduction of revalidation has acted as something of a catalyst and driver to ensure that organisations are doing effectively what they should have been doing in any event. From where we are sitting, the introduction of the role of the responsible officer has made a significant difference in addressing issues that should probably have been addressed before now.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q39 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Grahame M.

Their job is to advise responsible officers on their—the responsible officers’—statutory responsibility. There is no accountability line between a responsible officer and employment liaison adviser, but a responsible officer does have three accountability lines. First, they have an accountability line within their own organisation to the designated body that Una has described, which is responsible in terms of the regulations. Secondly, they have a responsibility—I guess you eventually reach the Almighty—to their responsible officer; they are accountable to their responsible officer. The third line of accountability is that, like any doctor, they have accountability to the GMC. There are three slightly different strings at work here. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The employment liaison adviser is there as a supporter and adviser. Of course, if an employment liaison adviser was concerned about the clinical governance arrangements within a trust and about what was happening, they would alert their manager within the GMC, and we would take the necessary steps, going back to the trust itself and the responsible officer of that responsible officer, or, if it related to the actions of that individual and we could take steps, we would do so; but they are not there to supervise responsible officers.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q40 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Grahame M.

First, it is probably quite early days yet. Secondly, we have had experience of very small organisations that are designated bodies. When we talk about organisations, sometimes we think of significant hospital trusts, training hospitals, local area teams and GPs, but a number of these bodies are small independent organisations. We have had examples where one individual responsible officer seems to be the responsible officer for a range of organisations. That is not necessarily inappropriate or improper, but in those circumstances we have had conversations with that responsible officer’s responsible officer at regional sector level, and we begin to probe issues such as that to begin to understand whether there is a genuine difficulty that we would need to address. It is probably slightly early days yet. We have not had any significant concerns raised about responsible officers in relation to the larger NHS organisations, but no doubt that time will come.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Grahame M.

What more do you plan to do to feed patient feedback into the appraisal and revalidation process?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Una Lane</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Again, it is fair to say that this is the beginning of a process for us. It is a genuinely big prize to see revalidation driving every single licensed doctor to seek feedback from patients periodically. If you look at some of the surveys in relation to health care </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">organisations that were doing this routinely over the last number of years, in 2011 only 25% of organisations providing health care to patients in the UK had processes in place to ensure that their doctors could seek feedback from their patients in a structured way and act on that. If you look at the most recent survey in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, over 90% of organisations now have such structures in place. We think we have set a base level where we believe that every doctor must periodically seek feedback from patients, but we absolutely agree with the Committee’s conclusions last year as well. We cannot stop here. Our view is that it is not simply a matter of moving from once every five years to twice every five years, and that will be fine and everybody will be happy. We need to get much more sophisticated about how we engage with patients on this particular issue.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Some of the early work we have been doing with both doctors and patients is that structured feedback is all very fine, but both sides very often want a proper dialogue. Patients want to be involved more generally with the practice or care that has been provided in their organisations. We had a seminar with patient groups in October, which came up with a range of suggestions about how patients could be involved in the review of significant events—for example, reviewing complaints raised by patients and organisations—and we are beginning to explore, although we are just on the threshold, how we can use things like social media or link in with friends and family tests.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We are completely with the Committee on this. It is very important that every doctor seeks feedback from patients. We are making some progress on that, and we expect every doctor to be part of that structured process over the next number of years, but we want to explore much more widely and broadly how we can be more imaginative, become more sophisticated about it and work with others to ensure that patients have a genuine, proper voice in the evaluation of their doctors.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Niall Dickson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is worth adding that, as well as the structured feedback that we require once every five years, we require doctors, as part of the supporting information they bring to their annual appraisal, to include all compliments and complaints they have had over that period. It should be an ongoing part of it. I suspect we are in the early days of a revolution in how patient feedback is fed to professionals. The digital revolution is driving a lot of this and making it a lot easier. We have set up a system; we are trying it out and it will change. We will develop it and listen to what patients and patient groups say.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Before we go on to fitness to practise, I would like to go back to professional obligations, as Dr Wollaston and Charlotte Leslie had a question on that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q42 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Wollaston:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I have a question about your </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">role</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in medical education and work force recruitment in crisis areas. We have touched on A and E and obstetrics and gynaecology, but there is also a real work force shortfall in primary care. Do you feel that a lot of this goes back further than doctors after graduation—back to medical school—in the emphasis on, say, primary care and education around A and E within medical schools themselves? How much do you feel that feeds into the work force problem?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Sir Peter Rubin</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: My personal view is that if a student is not exposed to enthusiastic role models they are unlikely to go into a particular area. I did what I did because of role models, not because of some textbook. So there is that element to it. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There are also more complex issues about lifestyle, how people want to practise and so on. You need good role models and you need medical students, including the foundation programme, to be exposed to all the good bits of A and E and primary care. In the right </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">environment, A and E can be such good fun, because it is front-line medicine; you are dealing with acutely ill people and you can change their lives. If you have role models who really enjoy that, you can have a big change in recruitment. Equally, once recruited, you and I both know that you have to make sure that the environment is right. If you are just drowning under a torrent of new patients coming through the door and feel you are practising bad medicine, you want to do something else.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q43 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Wollaston:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Except, of course, that as </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">the</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> GMC, your role is in shaping the medical curriculum.

We are bound by European law. Doctors from the European Economic Area have a right to come into this country if their qualification is recognised under European law. We would argue that it is a weakness in our regulatory defences, and that is why, on the language side, we have made such a noise about trying to get that changed. As far as medical schools in other parts of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> are concerned, we are not able to do that, and the new directive does not do so. The system we have just described of responsible officers and so on means that when these doctors come to this country they will have to get a responsible officer. That responsible officer will have a duty to ensure that doctors are competent to do the jobs they are doing, and that they have the language skills to be able to perform.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q47 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Charlotte Leslie:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I am sorry to interrupt, but we have such little time.

That has been the case for a number of years. Every single doctor who is registered and licensed with us is subject to revalidation. The point we try to emphasise on revalidation is that it is not a point-in-time assessment. The whole idea of revalidation is that it is meant to be a continuous evaluation of the doctor’s practice in the workplace. Every doctor from the EEA who comes to work here in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> must connect to a designated organisation and a responsible officer, and must maintain a portfolio of information and bring that to appraisal on an annual basis to support their revalidation.

In some ways, does it not feel, from yours and Sir Peter’s point of view, a bit like a return to the past? Pre-2003, there were hospital recognition committees and specialist commissioning boards from the royal colleges. They went round and did not do just a paper survey of trainees but interviewed them confidentially, and lots of problems were raised if there was an issue with a senior consultant. It was a very rigorous way of doing it and was more than just a paper survey. When the PMETB was introduced—and you, Sir Peter, were on the board of that—that kind of did away with that. In some ways, does it not feel like a back-to-the-future system and like we are reinventing something we scrapped in the early 2000s?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Sir Peter Rubin</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: At its best, the college visiting system was very good; at its worst, it was unhelpful. The problem was that there was such a wide spectrum in the quality of the college visits. For those who do not know, I was the chairman of this organisation PMETB—the Postgraduate Medical Education Training Board. In the year before PMETB was established, there were over 1,100 individual visits by colleges to training locations, and the quality of the information provided by those visits was incredibly variable. That was the problem. We would argue that the national trainee survey, which was begun by PMETB and is now far more sophisticated at the GMC, gives a much more robust view of training across the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. With 50,000 trainees, a 95% or 96% response rate and a lot of granularity in the questions, we think this is a much more powerful system, particularly when we can then follow up issues that need to be pursued.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Charlotte Leslie:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It was just an observation.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q49 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Wollaston:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We understand from your evidence that there have been 8,109 complaints from the public to the GMC in 2012, which is a 24% increase on the previous year. You also said that you are undertaking research to understand why this increase is continuing. Are you able to share any of the interim findings of that research with the Committee today?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Niall Dickson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I cannot share or confirm it because we are just initiating it now, but we have done earlier research. We are trying to understand more about the public. We have talked a little about understanding what is happening within the health care world and why you might get more in that sense. The only thing you can say about the evidence is that we are not unusual. Other professions, including health care professions, have seen similar increases. Nor are we alone in national terms. You will see similar increases in developed countries in other parts of the world. I do not think anything strange is happening in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Why is it happening? The obvious point is that patients are less deferential; they are more questioning of professionals, not accepting necessarily what they say; they have more access to information than they ever had. Therefore, the asymmetry of information between professional and patient has begun to change.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The technology itself is quite interesting and is not something we had really thought about. In order to make a complaint to the Singapore Medical Council you have to get a public notary to sign it off. The speed with which you are able to do that and how easy you find it to complain is a factor. In the past, you would have had to write a letter to the GMC and put it in an envelope; now you can go online and quite easily fill in a form. If you phone our contact centre, the staff will help take you through it if you have any difficulty. There is something about ease of access to raising complaints as well, but we may find other reasons that I have not mentioned.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q50 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> On </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">the</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> point about patients being more demanding and having more choice, there are also patients who now get very worried about the side effects of drugs. The Science and Technology Committee, of which I am also a member, is looking at antimicrobial resistance and problems with antibiotics. Wearing the hat of the chair of the All-Party Group on Integrated Healthcare, many people now go alternative medicine because they are concerned about some of the side effects of drugs. They will turn to herbal or homeopathic medicine because they do not want to go down that route. We have to recognise that the winds of change, to paraphrase Macmillan, are blowing through health as they blew through </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Africa</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. Surely, we have to recognise that, if we are to give patients choice, we have to listen to what they are asking for.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Sir Peter Rubin</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Perhaps I could answer that as a doctor. I agree with you 100%. I was involved in high blood pressure for many years. For example, in my high blood pressure clinic, in randomised controlled clinical trials, a sizeable percentage of patients taking placebo tablets found that their blood pressure went down. My pragmatic view is that, if it works, great; blood pressure has gone down. If alternative therapy or homeopathy—or the two combined with conventional therapy—work, my very pragmatic view, which I have held for many years, is that that is what the patient wants; they want their blood pressure to go down, their anxiety to be relieved or whatever. So I absolutely agree with you.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> On that very point, the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">university</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Bordeaux</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> published a study called “EP13”, which shows that, among the 40,000 French doctors who practise homeopathy, where they have combined homeopathy with conventional medicine, the costs of treatment and the amount of conventional drugs prescribed have gone down, but patient satisfaction has gone up. I really do not want to dwell on this, and it would be out of order to do so. Well, it would probably not be out of order because I am chairing the Committee, but I am not going down this route. But there are things happening out there. We have to be alert to these new studies and, if not act on them, at least recognise that they are valid.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q51 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Charlotte Leslie:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> In </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">looking</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> at the GMC’s decisions on fitness to practise and, I suppose, public trust in its ability to judge cases, which is important for doctors coming forward, I want to turn to a specific case, but only to illustrate issues within the GMC about which doctors and the public feel suspicious.

The reason it is important is because it is a very symbolic case. Is the GMC on the side of the establishment and very senior people in management who happen to be clinicians as well, or is it on the side of the whistleblower—the disruptive influence, if you like? One thing of concern to the public is that the GMC judgment on Barbara </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Hakin</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> seemed so counter-intuitive to the evidence that the GMC received. In many cases it seems that Barbara </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Hakin’s</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> account was taken over the evidence received that something was wrong in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Lincolnshire</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and that extra capacity was needed. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I know you have said that patient safety and targets are the same, but the code of conduct recommends a capacity review because it is acknowledged that they are not always the same. It was said that safety was fine in July 2009, but that was not the period over which safety was being talked about. We have seen the handwritten note from Barbara </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Hakin</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> talking about putting targets ahead of demand. To the lay person looking on, given all these things, it looks very much like the GMC has supported one of its most senior members against all the evidence. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Niall, earlier you said that the GMC shares conflicting evidence—evidence that seems to contradict the initial evidence. Those who give the initial evidence have a chance to refute it and say why the contradicting evidence is not true.

The early results are positive in the cases we have done so far. We are able to operate this at the moment only with lesser sanctions.

With things going backwards and forwards, there can always be additional things they want to say at that point. At that time we would say, “We think this is the appropriate sanction that needs to be taken in order to protect the public.” The doctor then has a choice. They can say they accept the sanction—as in somebody pleading guilty in a court, all of that would be in the public domain, so nothing is being hidden away. If they do not accept that and think the sanction we are proposing is not appropriate, or they dispute the facts, the matter would continue to go to a hearing.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The results so far are very positive.

As far as the meetings with doctors are concerned, the measure of success would be where doctors accepted our sanction. We are proposing that the Professional Standards Authority is able to audit all our decisions in this area so it is able to see and judge whether we are making the appropriate sanction based on the evidence. It is important that there is external scrutiny of that process. It is a combination of things. If doctors accept the sanctions, we are shortening the process and they are feeling better about the process as a result, and if witnesses are not put through the trauma of having to appear in front of a hearing and we are succeeding in protecting the public, those are certainly the aims we would hope for as a result of the pilot.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q55 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Wollaston:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> But you will be </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">carrying</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> out a study with complainants to see how satisfied they are with this alternative procedure.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Niall Dickson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes. The GMC is the body taking these cases through, not the complainant. In the past, we used to have a system where complainants were parties to it, but it is the GMC taking it forward. But, absolutely, at the same time we are having meetings with complainants and monitoring that process as well. We are having two meetings with them, one at the start of the process and one at the end, and hearing what they think about the process.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q56 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Wollaston:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What criteria are you using to establish that a doctor has developed better insight into the failings that led to the complaint in the first place and, critically, has changed their performance?

The general approach in the past has been that the doctor shows insight and says, “Yes, I admit I did it and I have done a course and started to mend my ways” and so forth. We certainly want to explore whether doctors might make an apology to the complainant, which is not part of either the panel’s process or our process. It is an area we will be looking at.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Currently, we are also having discussion with the Department of Health in the run</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">up to the Bill about whether insight itself is enough in our being able to reach the right sanction. In other words, under the case law as it has developed, where a doctor shows insight and says, “I’m all better now; everything is sorted” and so on, there is a tendency for the system to say, “The doctor has shown insight, contrition and so forth, and therefore they are not a future risk to patients and there should not be any action or lesser action should be taken against them.” </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The discussion we are having with the Department of Health is about whether there are circumstances where a doctor has been reckless—that is to say has caused harm to patients or put them at risk, and they should have known that—but there is an accountability line that should be applied. In other words, we should be concerned about the reputation of the profession as well as the safety of patients, and we have to get that balance right. Parliament will have an opportunity to debate—I know it sounds quite a technical issue, but it is a very important one—how we get the right balance between not trying to punish doctors but, on the other hand, holding them to account where the public would expect them to be held to account.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q57 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Wollaston:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I guess </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">what</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I meant was how far you go in following up whether the sanctions have been complied with.

We still have to discuss exactly how we will do this, but, in principle, we are hoping to make it as transparent as possible. Obviously, anything that is done to a doctor’s registration appears on our register, because there is anxiety that somehow this is all behind closed doors. I use the analogy again of a criminal case. Where somebody appears and pleads guilty, you do not go through all the evidence in court in that instance. In this instance we would make absolutely sure that it was known to the complainant. We would contact them and make sure they were informed of the action that had been taken. As we work through the meetings process, we would probably have a meeting with the complainant and discuss with them what had been found and said.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We have to work out what we would put on the register. The decisions would absolutely be on there, so it is not a question of covering up any of that. If there were public interest in it, we would issue a press statement and so forth. We have to work out the granular detail of this. At the moment, we are dealing with much lesser things because that is all the law allows us to do, but, if we get legal change, we will certainly be absolutely clear that these are made public.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q59 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrew George:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I have given </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">you</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> advance notice of a specific case.

I have had quite extensive correspondence with the GMC in relation to this particular case. If I simply give the principles, this relates to a hospital death in April </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">2006. In</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> 2008, the Healthcare Commission issued a report highly critical of the doctor responsible for this particular patient, and the GMC decided not to proceed with a fitness to practise hearing in 2009. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">A coroner’s inquest in 2011, nearly five years after the death, identified that this was an avoidable death caused by failure of basic standards of treatment by the doctor concerned. It ordered the issuing of a fresh death certificate referring to the inappropriate use of “do not resuscitate” orders and effectively demonstrated that the GMC’s decision not to proceed with a hearing was flawed. The GMC then decided not to reopen the hearing, or not to institute a fresh hearing, in the light of that evidence. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">My constituents who have raised this case with me feel deeply frustrated. I guess it is a common pattern, whether they are dealing with ombudsmen services or others. They feel they are engaged in a complaint management system rather than a genuine investigation, which is sapping their energy and attempting to bamboozle them with the sophistry and artifice that is sometimes deployed to push such complainants away. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The point that arises is that, where another statutory body—in this case the coroner—comes to a significantly different conclusion from the one the GMC has already come to in deciding not to proceed with a fitness to practise hearing, it seems to me from this particular case that the GMC automatically becomes very defensive and defends its original decision. My question is, on how many occasions has this happened? How can you reassure me that the GMC takes this on the chin, as it were, and does not automatically go into defensive mode?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Niall Dickson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: First, I am sure that organisations do go into defensive mode. I certainly hope that the staff who are dealing with this, who quite likely were not around in 2006, are not going to be very defensive. There are certain things that we are bound by under statute. One of them is the five-year rule, which says you may not open up cases after five years unless these things are met, and it is a very high bar.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrew George:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Is that five years from the death or the decision of the GMC not to proceed?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Niall Dickson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I would have to check, but I think it is five years from the incident itself.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrew George:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> That is important, because it is quite a long time delay.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Niall Dickson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Indeed it is.

The reality is that we open up cases where we have made mistakes on a fairly regular basis. There is a thing called rule 12, which is a process we go through to look at decisions we have made. We regularly order reviews and then open up cases where we have made mistakes in the past. I hope that, in principle, we are not defensive. Clearly, we do not get decisions right every time; we do make mistakes, but I hope that in the kind of case you have described we would look at it very closely.

First, the panel is not out to punish. We are not a criminal court; we are not punishing doctors, if we have made a decision against the doctor. As we have all said, it is a question of the protection of the public and patient, and that includes the reputation of the profession. If a panel has made a decision in favour of the doctor and the GMC does not like it, the GMC has no right of appeal. This Committee has said on at least two occasions now that it would favour giving the GMC a statutory right of appeal. I certainly would be very much in favour of that. The GMC is in favour of it, and we would hope that legislation would allow an appeal to be taken by the GMC if a panel has made a decision that, frankly, cannot be supported on the facts of the case. At the moment the doctor can appeal but the GMC cannot. I would hope that that would deal with the sort of issue that arises when a decision is taken that cannot be justified.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Niall Dickson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There will be an opportunity for Parliament, if this Bill comes before it, to look at the five-year rule.

There are circumstances where, clearly, we would like to be able to pursue this. This is a real public policy issue that people have to discuss. There are two balanced rights to be considered, and it is absolutely appropriate that Parliament discusses that when the Bill goes through.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q62 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrew George: </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Can I </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">come</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> back to your defence, or explanation, rather, in relation to rule</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">12 and relate that also to rule 28?

It is the same person and event, but it is a new hearing in the light of a whole set of new evidence that has come to light which the GMC completely missed on the previous occasion. The question really is, first, is rule 12 being applied appropriately? Secondly, you talk about the opportunity for Parliament to review decisions in relation to the five-year rule. Will there be, or indeed are there, opportunities for the GMC to make recommendations to itself to change its own rules if they are constraining it from pursuing logically, on the basis of basic justice, cases that clearly need to be not so much reopened as restarted?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Niall Dickson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: My understanding is that this is stuff in statute, so, no, we cannot change the rules ourselves. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrew George: </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">No, you can’t change the rules.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Niall Dickson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: You can change the rules; you can do that.

On this occasion the finding, certainly in the narrative conclusions in the coroner’s report, suggests it was inappropriately applied to a patient whose death was avoidable. Is there a pattern in the medical profession where, increasingly, there are cases of an alleged inappropriate application of “do not resuscitate” orders, in which we should consider the extent to which the proper procedure is gone through—discussing it with the patient and/or their family and seeking the opinion of other colleagues before such decisions are taken—so that the consequences are fully explained to those who are going to be affected?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Sir Peter Rubin</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Rather than give the Committee an off-the-cuff answer, I think it would be far better if we could take that one back, ask about it within the organisation and get back to you with information.

Some of this is quite complex—to understand the nature of the concerns presented to us and then the outcome at the end, and obviously the two things have </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">to match up. We continue to look at this area to make absolutely sure that we are treating people fairly. As Peter says, there is a significant issue around doctors who come with overseas qualifications. We are taking steps—not least, we are piloting an induction programme for those doctors, because they themselves have said in studies and so on that they feel isolated and want additional support. We also hope that good RO arrangements will again also help. Practising medicine is a set of skills and competencies, but it is also culturally specific.

I did look into this. These are the figures from June 2012 to December 2013. The MPTS has been in existence for that period of time, so these are MPTS decisions. I am not talking about any decisions prior to that. In that period of time we had 61 fitness to practise cases dealing with doctors with a criminal conviction. Of those 61 cases, erasure plus immediate suspension was made in 27 cases, which is 44.3%. There was suspension in 26 of them, which is 42%. Of the 61, you have a large number of those cases resulting in either erasure or suspension.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">At the other end of the scale, there were just four cases out of 61—I will mention those in a moment—where there was either no impairment with a warning, no impairment at all, or impairment and no action. I have looked into those cases, and they were all relatively minor matters. I say “minor”, but they were matters in relation to which perhaps the public—the community out there—would not be surprised to find the doctor was still in practice. There was a conviction but it was for a minor driving offence.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q68 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Grahame M.

Two date from 2004 and one from 2006. I believe, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">though I am not sure in every case because it is quite a long time ago, that the GMC called for their erasure at that time. To be absolutely clear, the leadership of the General Medical Council and all its bits would absolutely, every time, in the instances you are referring to, want to see the doctor erased. If you give us the right of appeal and the panel does not, we will do it. This is not a debatable issue. Looking back and seeing things in the past, they are still there; we have to manage that process, but we are absolutely clear about the stance we would take on these matters.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q69 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Grahame M.

The first is that we have a quality assurance group, which I chair. That group looks at almost all the decisions taken by fitness to practise and interim order panels. We meet regularly every four weeks and look at all of those cases. If there are learning issues or concerns, I take it upon myself to write to all three members of the panel and the legal assessor about those issues to ask them to reflect, because it is part of the training.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">As to the second development, we have instituted a training programme for all of our panel members, both the long-standing ones and the new ones. We have a lot of new panel members. That is a very regular training programme of a residential kind, five days a year for new members and regular annual training for existing panel members, where we look at all of the trends in case law and the procedures to ensure we have consistency.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The third very important introduction is a system of mentoring for newly appointed members and appraisal, especially for our chairs. I and some of my colleagues sit in on and observe many of the hearings, including the “in camera” discussions that take place, to ensure that there is consistency in the way in which the panels are discussing cases. We emphasise reasons. It is very important that when the panel reaches a decision it gives very clear reasons, obviously for the doctor but also for the profession at large, the complainant and indeed the GMC, because that is the body bringing the case. We publish those decisions. Everybody has a way of seeing exactly the way in which the panel has reached its decision.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Measurement is always rather difficult in this particular area.

All I can say in relation to your question, and indeed any other changes—and we would very much like to see a number of changes in the legislation—is that I hope that that would be in place before the next general election at least.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The changes we would like to see are, first, the right of appeal in the GMC, which we have already talked about, and, secondly, a costs regime. We are introducing case management in a very detailed way. Case management is really the key to having effective hearings where all of the issues of procedure and, if you like, legal applications are dealt with before the hearing starts, so that time is not wasted in legal argument on the first day of the hearing. The only way in which we can get the parties—the GMC as well as the doctor’s representatives—to comply with directions is to say to them, “If you behave unreasonably in the conduct of the proceedings, there is a cost implication.” We would very rarely use that, but at least it would concentrate the minds to ensure that case management was complied with. But again, that would require a change in the legislation.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">As to the third area that we would like to see in the form of legislation, at the moment the Medical Act states that the appointment of a legal assessor is mandatory. Legal assessors play a very important role in many of our hearings, but there are other hearings where, quite frankly, there is no law involved. In particular, in review cases and many of our interim order panel hearings, there is really no law; it is an assessment of risk. With a robust chair and well trained panel, it is not necessary to have a legal assessor appointed to be in place, at some cost to the profession. We would like to see the mandatory requirement replaced with a discretionary one.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Finally, we would also like to see a change in legislation to put the MPTS on a statutory footing—at the moment we do not have a statutory base—so that we would be accountable as the MPTS to Parliament, perhaps with an annual report to this Committee from them.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Sir Peter Rubin</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: In answer to your question, perhaps I may say something so that it is written into the record.

First, the Medical Act, as we have long argued, prevents us from doing anything in relation to the testing of language. The change that will go through now will expose us to European law</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">in that sense, so we are hoping to set up something that is compliant with current European law to give us the ability, if we have a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">doubt about a doctor’s language abilities, to do something about it, and there are some other provisions as well.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The second defence is that we now have responsible officers with a very specific duty when they take people on to make sure the individual is language-competent. European law is also going to change. We have done a lot of work in trying to persuade other countries to go along with this. Other countries have similar concerns about doctors crossing borders and not having this ability, so European law is going to change to allow all competent authorities covering all health professions to test on a more routine basis to check that individuals have language competence. That is the next step, as it were, but we are going through the first step of unlocking the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> legislation and constructing something with the responsible officers, which, combined, is not perfect but much better than we had.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q77 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Wollaston:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Can I </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">come</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> to the issue of transparency and conflicts of financial interest? Is it time for the GMC to set up a register whereby it is easy for the public to check whether a doctor has a conflict of interest? It might be a journalist, for example, writing articles that have been influenced by payments by a drug company, or consultants speaking at very lavish conferences. There are many examples of where people have concerns. The procedure we now have for MPs is very straightforward. Is it time to have the same for doctors?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Niall Dickson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think we are on the verge of a revolution in information and what will be available. We guard what is on the register quite carefully, so everything currently on the register is a fact; it is not a matter of debate or discussion. However, we have said that we will look at the register and accessibility to it. Additional information will almost inevitably come out as a result of the revalidation process, but we are also going to look at how useful the register is. As part of that, we will look at conflicts of interest, the practicality of it and whether we will be able to do it. I am not giving any guarantees, but it is part of our wider look at how we can make the register as useful as possible. Doctors absolutely have an obligation under our guidance to record and make clear any conflicts of interest they have, and we have reinforced that guidance in recent times.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q78 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Wollaston:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Where can the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">public</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> access that information?

The issue here is that we recently changed our “Good Medical Practice” guide, which is our headline guidance, in the light of an extensive consultation that wanted it to be shorter.

Because we have been through a very tortuous process of consultation and so forth, we have a slightly more flexible approach now.

He also told us, “We know with cancer that people who use complementary medicine on their cancer journey, which is between 20% and 40% of people with cancer, get a huge amount of ability to self-care and a lot of positive survivorship skills from using complementary medicine, not as a cure but as a long-term survivorship process.” </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Sir Peter, going back to your earlier remarks, when you basically agreed with what I was saying, could you expand on that and tell us how you see the paradigm developing, given the new circumstances?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Sir Peter Rubin</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: In our education guidance we require that undergraduate medical students are taught about alternative medicine and complementary therapy because, as you say, it is the real world; people are using alternative medicines extensively.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q87 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> My </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">colleague</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> was telling me that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Bristol</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> medical school is now teaching complementary and alternative medicine.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Sir Peter Rubin</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes, and that is probably the result of our guidance which introduced this for the first time when we last published it two or three years ago. We are very keen that the world as it is should be reflected in our guidance. Long gone are the days when a doctor would be very dismissive of alternative approaches to treatment. Whether they are alternative therapy of the sort you are describing, chiropractors or whatever, if it works and it is safe, fine.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q88 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> My last question relates to a current issue, which is the regulation of herbal medicine.

I am going to be the vice-chair of that group under Professor David Walker, the new deputy chief medical officer.

If you have not formed a view, would you please form one in line with that requirement? There are those lobbying very strongly for statutory regulation and some who say it could be dealt with by voluntary regulation, so it will go either to the Professional Standards Authority—I do not expect it will come your way—or to another organisation that could possibly do it. Given that this is part of your strategic aim, would you write to the Chair of this Committee and express a view, which I can then take to the herbals working party, which will start work in January?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Sir Peter Rubin</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We will undertake to do that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You will write to the Health Committee.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Sir Peter Rubin</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes, we will.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Una and gentlemen, thank you very much for a very long and worthwhile session.
