DDID states that “despite the political progress so far Burma remains one of the poorest countries in Asia.” (We may note that Chin State, by the statistics of the Burmese government itself, is the poorest.) This will inevitably continue as long as the condition of the ethnic nationalities is largely ignored. And as long as warfare and the breaking of truces continues to hinder economic and social development.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">3.</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The taking of land by the policy of the central government, the well-documented removal of populations, and the exploitation of mineral, water and other resources, such as notoriously amongst the Shan and Kachin, for the benefit of supporters of the central government, lie at the base of the continuing poverty and failure to achieve genuine development.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">4.</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">A worthwhile attempt to address poverty within Burma must be targeted at these, either directly, or indirect through policies that will genuinely alleviate their effects while also building up the strength and awareness and organization of the peoples concerned to resist the implications of these policies.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">5.</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Indirect government aid through other agencies is able to achieve large results and has great potential for the future.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">6.</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Indigenous relief and development groups amongst the peoples are proving their greater efficiency compared to that sometimes achieved by international bodies.

The governments of Guernsey, and especially Jersey, have been generous in their support for this work. DFID was generous in its support for famine relief 2008-2009 amongst the same people, although, unfortunately, it was felt that these funds had to be transmitted via the WFP so only a very much reduced aid reached the ground, and none to the remoter areas which indigenous organizations were perfectly able to reach with their, sadly, more limited resources. However, if one considers how funding from DFID could assist the expansion of this work, as well as its replication in other parts of Burma, the following are of interest:</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">7.1   Provision of education for the ethnic Peoples.
