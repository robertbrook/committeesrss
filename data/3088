font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">I think it is both a necessary part of the breakup of these estates and a necessary step toward the fulfilment of the potential of the tenanted farm.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:11pt">Without doubt, it is more efficient in the running of the farm where all investment decisions are made by the occupier of the farm.</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">As a tenant this is not always possible as landlord permission is often necessary.</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light';

font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Investment of borrowed money is often required, however without owning the land on which the investment will be made, or without the owner’s approval for the development, funding may not be available.</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">This is clearly evidenced by the disproportionate sums of SRDP funding allocated to tenanted farms as opposed to owner occupied farms.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:11pt">Perhaps the most alarming is the prevalence of poor housing with many farmhouses existing beyond tolerable wind and watertight standard.</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Often landlord willingness to improve, or cooperate in improving property is not forthcoming.</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Financing such commitment as a tenant is again often unattainable.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Poor and inadequate steadings, poor fencing, roads and very often water supplies are also common factors in calls for ARTB.</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Perhaps the greatest justification in the need for ARTB is that in many cases the tenant’s family has devoted several generations of blood sweat and tears into the fabric of their farm, scratching a living and surviving despite the thankless hardship endured against discouragement and unwelcome feeling from a reluctant landlord.</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Foot-dragging by landlords and inevitable legal expense over succession issues, again generates further discomfort and uncertainty, often at emotionally charged times.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:11pt">None of these circumstances should ever have persisted and it is to the credit of those families who have survived and maintained rent payments into the twenty first century that granting the ARTB to such tenants would be fitting acknowledgement of their farming worth on what has amounted to only half an opportunity.</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">As, invariably, they are already more familiar with their farm than whoever who owns it today, it is surely in the public interest that such tenants be given opportunity to fully develop their farm as they would like and know best. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">When the issue of human rights comes to mind, I cannot help thinking that if granting the right to sell off maintained public housing stock to sitting tenants of often relatively short tenancy met human rights standards, then ARTB to tenants of several generations standing, despite lack of landowner maintenance, must surely meet such standards.</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">There is a distinct public interest in having much needed renovation and further development of such farms, only likely by conversion of sitting tenants into owner-occupation status.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;
