I was rather intrigued by it. I think it was a very interesting idea indeed. There is something that was linked to that, which was effectively saying that community ownership, because it has to be by democratic mandate, becomes another form of public ownership. The problem in a sense is that it is not a public body in legislative or other terms. A public body possibly could borrow from the Public Works Loan Board, but it is a very interesting idea.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">It is the case, too, that there are forms of banking</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">I perhaps shudder to mention it</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">, but </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">the Co-op Bank, for example, did take very particular approaches, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">and</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> there are other banks that take community groups that have reasonably good borrowing rates. So the Public Works Loan Board would certainly be one avenue worth looking at, and I would hope the Committee could look at that. It is perhaps not the only avenue.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">There is one other point and that comes back to the power of ownership of the ground. If I go</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> back to that South Uist</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> example, the community owners there bought the estate a few years ago in a very run</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">down condition</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> and barely washing its face financially, for about £4 million or thereabouts.

If you want to hear more about it, we have made a submission to the Land Reform Review Group about the changes to the Land Reform Act, which essentially tackles that latter point that Angus Campbell has raised about what do you do in circumstances where land is never going to come on to the market or never likely to, and yet the land uses are not anywhere near meeting their potential and the community have aspirations. We fundamentally believe that you have to widen out to all communities the right that already exists for crofting communities, and we have suggested a land agency could help facilitate discussion between landowners and communities.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">There is a lot of evidence now in the Western Isles, in particular, where negotiations are taking place against the backdrop of a fallback power, if necessary, to acquire in the public interest a change of ownership.

We do not seem to have a mechanism for deciding whether that monopoly ownership is in the public interest, and yet we have lots of other mechanisms in other parts of society to look at monopolies and the public interest. Therefore, the question arises—and Community Land, Scotland is going to be debating this quite soon—as to </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">whether we </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">should be encouraging you to think along these lines too and begin to explore</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> whether a land registry</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">, for example, might have a role at the request of Ministers or by some other mechanism to investigate whether it was in the public interest that land continued in a kind of monopoly ownership situation.

Therefore, everybody on that island is affected by that peculiarity. Whereas on the mainland you can partly escape that in some respects. In that sense, there may be a difference but fundamentally the same questions arise as would arise on an island, and it is about aspiration, it is about the potential of the land and how you can best utilise that to develop sustainable communities.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q68 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir James Paice:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> I want to take on one of the four groups, which is the policy of taxation and public subsidy, if I may. But before I do that can I just press you on fundamentally the position of CLS in terms of what you want to see because you just made the comment, Peter, that implies that monopoly ownership of a large tract of land may be bad but communities obviously find it difficult to dissent from that view. Do you fundamentally take the view that large scale private ownership of tracts of land is wrong and should be changed? Therefore, you have a baseline view that says that communities should be able to own whatever land they want regardless of who owns it owns it now, if they are large tracts of land, or are you happy with the concept of large scale private ownership if it is a benign ownership?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Peter Peacock</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">: We have not approached the problem in quite that way. If you took any individual instance of a large holding of land, then there will be many communities in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> who are perfectly happy with that ownership structure and they do not feel it inhibits development in any particular way. Therefore, we would not think that there was any need to transfer the ownership of that land. It has to come from people who articulate a need to do that and they have to make a case to do it. We are not advocating that people can simply take somebody else’s land. It would have to be demonstrated—as the current Land Reform Act requires—to be in the public interest and to further sustainable development. These are reasonably high hurdles and we would argue that they should be maintained. On a case by case basis you might find those circumstances I have described. However if you take Scotland in aggregate, then you have this really unusual situation in Scotland where we have so few owners who own such a huge amount of the country, and fundamentally when looked at from that point of view we think it requires change. Why do we think it requires change? Because too few people have a stake in the land. That has an impact on investment in the land, we would argue. It has an impact on the potential uses of the land. This decision-making about the land use is in very few hands, and that we think that communities, if they articulate a need and a desire to own and manage that land more effectively for their long-term sustainable development, then in law they ought to be able to pursue that subject to the public interest test.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">I think if you take </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> as a whole we would argue that the current land ownership patterns are not justifiable in the long term. They do not serve the public interest. It excludes a huge number of people who would want a stake in the land from getting that stake in the land. Therefore, greater diversity of ownership is fundamentally what drives us. If you apply that to an individual estate or an individual circumstance, you may take the view that that is perfectly legitimate. It is the aggregate position. I think the other thing is that where we foresee a community ownership angle on land, we recognise there are other interests at play here, for example, in recent tenants right to buy in farming, but also in allotments and all sorts of other uses of land that communities want to get involved in. If you were able to hear a bit more of what Angus Robertson is doing in his community to use the land now to benefit a wide range of economic developments, there are some very impressive things going on and we want to see more of it.

The motivation underlying a lot of the marketing of land is for tax-beneficial purposes and for people to draw down grants and offset them against other arrangements and so on.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">What is a mystery to us is how this is done in detail, because our membership does not have that expertise. We are currently debating membership principles for our organisation, and one of them is that you will not offshore any of your arrangements for landholdings in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">. Our membership does not believe that is right, but we are aware that other people do. I think we think it is an area that deserves to have the lint lifted a bit and for people to understand what is going on here, what are the arrangements that are put in place.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Underlying our concern goes back to the point I was making to you earlier that if you fundamentally believe that there should be greater diversity of land ownership, which we do believe, then what are the arrangements that beset support that greater diversity occurring. On the face of it, it would appear that the arrangements for taxation, tax breaks, incentives, public subsidy and so on has the effect, from our perspective, of consolidating current ownership patterns, not adding to the greater diversification of land. That is the question we would quite like the Committee to look at: what policies would have to be in place to support a direction of travel that is about greater diversification and ownership of land and do the current arrangements do that or do they consolidate the current position. Our view is that they would appear to consolidate the current position. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Angus Robertson</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">: The thing we are looking for is about transparency and who owns the land. There are cases where we just do not know who owns some of these large estates, so there is no way we can approach individuals to get small parcels of it for local housing or what have you. We just do not know where these owners are. Some of them hide behind charitable status have a board of trustees which has no local representation on it at all.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">We obviously have a concern as to how to move forward with approaching estates and large landowners, and perhaps private investors overseas as well, as to how to approach them to engage with them to release more land for community use. A greater transparency would be a starting point anyway to find out about who to talk to on some of the issues that we have from a community perspective.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q70 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir James Paice:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> I do not want to put words in your mouth.

That said, we find it odd that in the mix of taxes that are available to the state we do not have land taxes really of any sort in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">. We used to have </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">some </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">rates that were applied</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> but which </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">were abolished some time ago. There is really no other form of land taxation per se in the overall mix of taxation. Clearly if you want to begin to move, if you share that objective of having greater diversity, are there things that can be done about land taxation that might create some of the incentives for that to happen? There are currently no such reliefs. That is one approach we would take. As to whether you would change certain rates of taxation of whether you should be able to offset certain inheritance things, we do not have the detailed knowledge to give you that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">One idea we did put in is that it seems to our members wrong that people should vest the ownership of land in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> in overseas vehicles.

Our concern principally is that the vision we would like to see is of more diverse ownership that is owned locally. Our members, part of the reason they now own their land is they have suffered over the generations and watched their community decline when the owner was absent. That could be absentee within the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">; it could be in other parts of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">. It could be </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> or </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Wales</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> or </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Northern Ireland</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> or it could be in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Denmark</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> or wherever. It is the fact they are absent at all from the land, and the land that people depend upon for their future, that I guess is the principal driver. I am not clear whether an EU lawyer could discriminate against another nation per se, but for us it is more caught up with a vision that is to have more diverse land ownership. Fundamentally we would like to see that locally determined, locally held.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q72 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir James Paice:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> Can I take this on to the next stage and link it back to my first question, which is do you see taxation—and you were talking just now about perhaps new taxes. The other option would be some fewer reliefs, which I personally think is the bigger issue here, which is encouraging land ownership in order to gain reliefs. If everybody was equal in terms of the tax, do you still think that the larger holdings should in some way be at least having the majority of them broken up, regardless? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Peter Peacock</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">: Not regardless. I think that when we find that served the public interest, that there was some clear case why that should happen—and the current law is driven by what would serve the public interest and we would want to see that maintained. I do not think it is a question of willy-nilly doing that. However, we are clearly aware of many communities who would like to own their land, we are aware of many individuals who would like to own a bit of land. We had an example this morning—I cannot remember whether the point was made before you arrived or not—of someone talking about the difficulty of being to get the 20 hectares or whatever to create a forest business that they otherwise could create.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">I think it is in the context of that greater diversity. It is not breaking up land for the sake of breaking up land, it is when there is an interest and when there is a community desire to do that. We are very clear you cannot thrust community ownership down the throats of communities. You have to want to do this and you have to have clear motivation for doing it. Provided that is in the public interest, what we want to see is a mechanism, a means, by which that can occur.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">On your particular point about reliefs of taxation, my personal instinct is somewhat along the lines that you have indicated, that the reliefs are what attract people into this. It is what the effects of that are in driving up land prices and what then are the other benefits that come with that. It is quite clear that the way that these are marketed encourages people to come in on that basis. That cannot serve that interest of wider diversification of ownership that we would argue for.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q73 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir James Paice:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> Taking this on a stage to your own members many of them—and Angus referred to charities just now—as I understand it many of your own organisation members enjoy tax charitable status. That in itself brings difficulty for tax advantages. There are some very, very large national charities, RSPB to name but one, but there is also Woodland Trust and the John Muir Trust and many others, apart from the Mount Stuart Trust, Applecross and so on. How do we take this argument about taxation forward in terms of equality? You are arguing some charities are perhaps too big or too remote—which I think was Angus’</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">s</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> point—and yet your own organisations, or many of them, are them themselves charities enjoying the same tax status.

RSPB money or tax breaks or what have you that we gain as an organisation all comes in to make us more sustainable as a group and ultimately then to pass on to the local community itself.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q74 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir James Paice:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> My point is that you are charities and what you said in of course applies, but by the same token other charities own land, which probably are not ploughing all the money back into the community. They may be using it for completely other purposes or buying more land or whatever. That is my concern, that by virtue of your charitable status you have certain tax advantages, and yet those same tax advantages also apply to other organisations who you seem to consider less responsible.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Peter Peacock</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">: I should first of all say, because you have raised it, that I am a member of the RSPB Committee in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">. I make that clear. I should also say that some of our members have had funding from national charities to help buy their land. The John Muir Trust, for example, has put up funding to help a couple of our members in the original purchase of the land, so we have quite close relationships with big, national conservation charities in that sense.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">I guess, just being blunt about it, there are charities and charities. What we are concerned about is that on the face of it—I will be careful what I say—it sometimes looks like some of the charities that were probably approved as charities quite some time ago before the new regulation of charities in Scotland came into effect, look like a front for the existing old family just to continue the old ownership and continue the old ownership practices, but now with charitable status which gives them tax advantages which allow them to keep the ownership of that land. That is what we are concerned about in terms of the charitable side of things. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">I would argue that we are entirely proper charities with public good at heart. The properties that Angus has described are owned by the community for public benefit, but that it is not the case, it would appear, in some of the arrangements. That is what we are looking at as one dimension of the tax advantages: are all charities, in the way they are constituted and constructed and their membership of trustees as elected—or not elected, appointed. Can you compare that to charities in the way that Angus was describing? We have concerns about that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q75 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir James Paice:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> But by saying—and I am not dissenting with you—that there are charities and there are charities, you underline a huge difficulty in how do you make that differentiation. Taking that, my last point to you is the whole issue of how charities themselves operate, the point you have just been referring to, Peter. Are you saying—without trying to put words into your mouth—that some of the ways some charities operate, whether it is to do with their internal structures or just the way they want to operate, can be counterproductive to the community or to innovation, entrepreneurial activity, things like that? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Peter Peacock</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">: I do not think it is so much whether they are a charity or not. One of the people who was here this morning was in exactly this situation, where that community is very, very frustrated by the management of the estate they live on and that their opportunities are being limited in a whole variety of ways. What is galling to that community is that the ownership is in a charity, and therefore the taxpayer, in a sense, is helping underwrite the management which they regard not to be in the public or community interest. That is what these people find galling about the situation: that the charitable status is being used in a particular way by what might appear to be the original family owners having converted it to a charity in some way and getting public benefits, when the community would like to see the whole thing move on its development. It is not that it is a charity it cannot move on, it just is more galling because it is charity and it does offer advantages and helps consolidate that ownership.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q76 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir James Paice:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> Your desire for a more equitable distribution of land ownership, diversity of land ownership, you would not wish to see charities per se be immune from that? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Peter Peacock</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">: No. I do not think it is a question of the charity per se. As you indicated, our members, some are charities. There are national charities we work in partnership with, or some of members are, for the purchase of land. It is not charities per se, it is the actual use of the land. But when a charitable status allows an owner to manage land in a way that the community does not support and approve of long term, then the state to some extent is underpinning that through the charitable status and the tax advantages it gets.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q77 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lindsay Roy:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> Can I just say that the Scottish Government should look again at what public benefit is</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">?</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Peter Peacock</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">: I think there is a question of charitable status in the terms that we are trying to encourage people to look at, because wider taxation measures, it fits within that.

The first part is about access to land, and I will put that to one side. Part 2 is about the community right to buy. It is not a right to buy; I will come back to that. The third part is about the crofting community right to buy. The crofting community right to buy in part 3 of the Act gives the crofting community the right to buy, even though the land is not on the market. The crofting community would have to demonstrate to Ministers, who would make that decision as to whether they could proceed to purchase the land, it was in the public interest and it furthered sustainable development, essentially.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The right to buy is a complete misnomer, because it is a qualified absolute right to buy, which is a ridiculous contradiction in terms.

Therefore, they currently do not have a right to buy under part 2 because you can only exercise your right to buy if the land comes on to the market.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q79 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jim McGovern:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> This specifically relates to the provisions of protocol 1, article 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights, because that is ultimately the one that we are arguing about here, which is that every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.

When you get to think about that, it has become increasingly anomalous that in the highland context one community could pursue, because they are a crofting community, a particular avenue of the absolute right to buy but another community facing exactly the same economic circumstances, or analogous economic circumstances, could not because they did not happen to meet the crofting community right-to-buy requirement.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">When you start thinking about that, you think why would you draw a boundary within the Highlands and </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Islands</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> for that?

It arose from my concern about crofting communities and so on. Everybody in a crofting community is not necessarily a crofter. But presumably in a community buy-in everybody is a participant in that. Is that any reason why the question of public interest is judged differently? Your crofting community or crofting group is only a section of interests. Does that explain why the latest rules— </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Peter Peacock</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">: I will have to go back and check this, but I am sure your adviser will know about this than I do. I think if you go back to the original Land Reform Policy Group that met after the 1997 election and before devolution, which did a lot of the groundwork on land reform that was then carried out with the Land Reform Act, I think part of the thinking that underpins this is that individual crofters already had a right to buy and could exercise their right to buy collectively in a variety of ways. That led into thinking about how you then created a crofting community right to buy, which would include the crofters but also non-crofters who are part of that community.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Be clear too that our position, irrespective of where this originated, is that you cannot expect to see a greater diversity of land ownership in Scotland being moved forward unless you widen that same right to wider communities so that the right to buy does not depend solely on land coming on to the market, because some land never comes on to the market. Nevertheless, it might be in the public interest that it was managed and owned differently. That is the fundamental point, leaving aside all the origins of it. It is a fundamental point of principle.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q90 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jim McGovern:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> The only other question was more in relation to local authorities to see whether you had a view on what other powers local authorities should have that would help with this type of problem. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Peter Peacock</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">: It was very brutal of Angus Campbell saying he thought I could speak on their behalf. We believe that the legislative framework needs to be right, and that requires the Scottish Government and Parliament to act on that, but thereafter any policies the local authority can put into effect that support communities in a variety of ways to exercise their right would be extremely welcome. But those are more matters for policy development and support. I don’t know if Angus has any thoughts on that from his practical experience on the ground, but it is more that a local authority would do that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">I could see arguments where a local authority might be invited to use their compulsory purchase powers to purchase land that they might then transfer to a local community, but if the community had that right themselves, that perhaps would not be necessary, but that might be a another way of looking at that. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Angus Robertson</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">: As a successful community group, we see it going in the opposite direction.

Obviously within the context of this debate on land reform it is important to clarify what we mean by community ownership. It is not necessarily the same as public ownership as we know it. I wanted to ask you if you could define what you mean by community ownership of land. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Peter Peacock</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">: There are several ways of attacking that. The Land Reform Act specifies what conditions would have to be met. It defines the community body for the purpose of the Act. It sets out means by which a community body has to demonstrate support for its action to seek to buy the land. It has to get assent to the purchase of that land from the community through a ballot and so on and so forth. There is a legal side to that and I guess that a more informal way of looking at this, which underpins membership principles that we have been looking at and discussing within our organisation, is that fundamentally this has to be something that is first of all desired by the community to own the asset. They have to be able to demonstrate that they are able to do something with that asset that is going to help further the sustainability of the community into the future. Also fundamentally it has to have the assent of the community in a clearly democratic way.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The benefit of the Land Reform Act, or some of the procedures the funders have picked up, some of it preceding the Land Reform Act, required the community to demonstrate that what they were doing had the absolute and clear consent of the community otherwise it could not be regarded to be a community enterprise and therefore community ownership. So it has to be fundamentally consented by the community.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q94 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Graeme Morrice:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> I suppose the community organisations that make up the membership of your own organisation needs to be representative.

Our membership is 75% of the adult population within our Sleat area itself. We are a charity and also a company limited by shares, and we have two subsidiary groups as well. That is all owned by the community with three separate boards, so we have accountability all the way through. We have open meetings, we have constant dialogue through email and various other workshops that we call, newsletters that we put out as well, so we are very accountable to our local membership in many different ways.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">We also have an office which is 9.00 am to 5.00 pm and people come through the door all the time to ask us questions, and ask questions of what we are doing as well. We are completely transparent with what we do. We are always going out. We have had reviews in the last few years of what we do and what we do right and what we do wrong. Our membership is very vociferous at telling us where we do something wrong or they don’t like what we do. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Peter Peacock</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">: Can I just add one clarification to that? The membership of the companies which own the land, following the community consent into that and there has to be a clear majority to do that, are individuals not bodies, or individuals within the community. There are some examples where communities have chosen to co-opt a director or have a director, have a right to have a director to other organisations. I think it would still be the case if you went to the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Island</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">A</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">, for example, the Highland Council probably has a right to have a member. I cannot be sure that it is right still or whether they have co-opted somebody from the council. To that extent you may have a body which is part of the community body, but in that case that would be a democratic body.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The other thing, just to emphasise again, is that we have taken some legal advice on this that we cannot force everybody in the community to be a member of the community company. They have to agree to be a member of the company. The rules that we operate by and are not to operate by, which we are still getting agreed by Community Land Scotland, would be that first of all any member of the community, without exception, can be a member of the company and the company should actively promote as much membership as they can get to try to further that democratic basis for the community.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q95 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Graeme Morrice:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> Just to clarify, Angus, you mentioned the figure of 75%.

Our membership has risen over the last five years or so from around about 60% up to that 75% figure. As we do more and more good work within the community itself, more people are coming on board with this as members. Being an open and free membership certainly helps as well.

We try to attack all these areas. We have a very vibrant environment group that looks after all things world-life related in our area itself. Socially, we try to bring together groups on social housing and we are looking at small housing developments within the area for people. Economically, we have started up our own enterprise fund, so, in effect, as a community organisation it is now a grant-giving organisation to local entrepreneurs and this is stimulating businesses to grow within our own demographic area itself, geographic area. We see these three aspects as the way to move forward in Sleat and we have been relatively successful in many of these areas so far. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Peter Peacock</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">: Adding to that, I think the other dimension to your question is </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Community Land</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> is representing the community landowners and therefore has a particular focus on that, but we recognise clearly that community land ownership is only one dimension of the must wider land reform debate.

Do you feel the reason for that is because it gives communities a stake in how land is managed and gives them influence in this? Do you think that is a fair comment to make? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Angus </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robertson:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Yes</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">, absolutely. We have a lot of our members who come to us and have actively engaged with their own land that we own, which is forestry land that we own.

It was about people trying to do that and community ownership was one of the ways of doing that. Today the motivation comes from communities having seen other communities, whatever the original motivation, doing things, making progress, developing jobs, developing housing, creating hopefulness out of hopelessness, as it was at one time. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Therefore, the clear driver today is for communities to get ownership of the land in order to develop their community because they see other communities doing it and it is successful. So the political dimension to it is it much less pronounced. It is much more about doing something that will help their community survive and develop.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q103 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Graeme Morrice:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> Do you think their engagement is because they feel this is the only way that communities can have an influence in the process? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Peter Peacock</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">: I think that is increasingly the case.

The only way to influence that was to get control of the land, and that is what has driven and underpins this. Controlling the land allows you to have a far greater control over your own destiny and to do all of the exciting things that Angus and his organisation and many others are doing. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q104 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Graeme Morrice:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> If land ownership was further regulated, perhaps ensuring that it can only be bought and sold in small parcels, do you think this would reduce the drive for community ownership? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Angus Robertson</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">: I don’t think so. I do know of several community groups that do not want to own large estates, they only want a small proportion of it, for whatever reason that may be, usually housing of some sort, where low-cost housing just is not available to them. I think there is probably in some instances still a need for bigger estates to be brought into community ownership just because of a lack of use of the land itself and there would be much more benefit to the community owning it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">I think perhaps there are many answers to that question, but a lot of groups just want access to some land and they cannot get access to any at all, certainly in rural and island locations in the Highlands and </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Islands</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> particularly. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Peter Peacock</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">: I was doing some stuff a couple of weeks ago, digging into an international dimension of land reform and came across the very idea that you have suggested.

The idea that lies behind your question applies in other contexts. I don’t think it would necessarily change the drive for community ownership.

In terms of the drive for community ownership of estates, have you always gone for complete estates or do you go sometimes for bits of estates? I think it was the point that you made, Angus, about people only wanting maybe a relatively small area in order to build houses. I was not sure if that was because it was only a small estate that they went for. Is it all or nothing or are there shades? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Angus Robertson</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">: It is definitely shades within it.

We have two large estates in our area. We have tried to work with the estates and we have a courteous relationship with them. The whole right-to-buy issue and a register of interest in it is something we have not gone down because we think that would break that relationship that we have and it would perhaps then turn into a hostile relationship with the estate itself.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">I cannot speak for my board, but whether it be we would want the whole of these estates or just parcels within it, I think there is probably a bit of both. Again, it would depend on what was being offered to us on the market itself at that time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Peter Peacock</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">: We have put this in our evidence to the Land Reform Review Group. One of the reasons we have argued for that extended right, but you would not be able to exercise that right unless you had tried to negotiate a deal with the landowner, is partly borne of this thinking that maybe you do not want all the land. Indeed, the landowner themselves might be quite prepared to negotiate, having never really realised that the community had particular aspirations or could develop. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">We are seeing in the Western Isles in particular a move to much more negotiation. That does mean giving and taking on whether it is the whole estate of bits of the estate. What you have to guard against in that is cherry picking. Angus and I were having a discussion earlier today about that. It would not be right for a community to go in and just cherry pick the good bits of ground, because that would leave an unviable remaining estate. Having said that, clearly our thinking is that by negotiation you may end up with a whole estate but you may not.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">In fact, if you look at one or two of our owners, they have come to arrangements with the existing private owner or with a new private owner, where the private owner has taken part of the land and the community has taken the rest, but that that has been by negotiation. It does not necessarily imply whole estates but there has been a pattern of that up until now.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q107 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> I was not thinking so much of cherry picking, I was thinking of people not wanting to bite off more than they could chew, in the sense of some of the estates being really quite substantial. If it was an all or nothing situation, then they would feel that is far, far more than they could cope with, however they could take 10% of it or 5% of it, a much lower proportion. That would be covered by the structures you were proposing. If there was anything compulsory it could be only a proportional type. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Peter Peacock</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">: Absolutely.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q108 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lindsay Roy:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> We have a figure of 500,000 acres currently in community ownership.

For us that would be a mistake. We want to see the opportunity of ownership being much wider than just the current land held in Government hands.

Do you think the use of 500,000 and doubling it to 1 million acres is the right criteria? Can I put it to you that not all land, particularly Scottish land, is equal? Somewhat linked to it is a challenge I should have put to you earlier when you said half of Scotland’s land is owned by a tiny number of landowners. It is quoting all the land as if it was all the same value. Is there not a case for saying what really matters is that communities can attain the land they need for their community purposes, whether it is for allotments or for affordable housing or local woodlands or whatever, rather than some bland figure of acres which could, in extremis, be half a million acres of very barren rock? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Peter Peacock</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">: It is not for me to say how politicians behave in setting targets, but there is a tendency to do that. What is important about it from our point of view is it is symbolic. That target is symbolic of a recognition by the Scottish Government that community land ownership has delivered a lot of things they are really pleased about, they want to see more of, and it is a way of saying, “We want to see more of this”. We do not find that unhelpful. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Within that, it is up to communities to say that they want the land. It is not up to Governments to force communities to take land. Communities will want to have the land that they think is going to benefit the long-term interests of their community. To that extent the communities will apply, at a local level, the value they attach to the land in the sense that you are describing it. The fact is that a 500,000-acre target will not affect communities who do not want to buy the land. But to the extent that it helps drive improvement in policy to allow communities to buy land, it is helpful.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q114 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> Can I just again try to be clear?

I think it is a commitment in that sense. The Scottish Government cannot deliver this other than through their own land by saying, “We are going to make that available in particularly beneficial terms in communities”. Therefore, they could deliver it that way, but I am afraid state agents’ interpretation will largely get in the way of that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q117 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> It is fair to say the more we look at this stated aspiration or commitment, the more vacuous it appears. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">In a sense, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">it is moving in the right direction. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">However, although i</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">t is an indica</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">tion of the direction travelled, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">it is not a firm commitment in the way that we maybe thought it was to begin with. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Peter Peacock</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">: I think it is a firm commitment insofar as it is saying within Government, “Prepare the ground to allow us to meet this target”.

There is no doubt that some of the large estates that have come into community ownership have come into community ownership because the community did not think the landowner was either vibrant or dynamic. Indeed, they would be neglectful and sometimes worse than that, if I can put it that way. But that does not mean that there are not large private estates that are not doing some quite remarkable things as well in developing housing, developing workspaces, developing forestry, creating employment and so on. Not all estates are that way, but I don’t think there is anything that I have found that a privately owned estate is doing that is vibrant and dynamic that a community owned estate could not also do and possibly do more. I think that we want to make sure that all land is managed in a vibrant and dynamic way.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q123 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lindsay Roy:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> Do you think community ownership has been a catalyst for change? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Peter Peacock</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">: I don’t think there is any doubt that if you went around the Highlands and </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Islands</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> in particular, where most of this has happened, that for the first time in generations you are seeing things happen that simply did not happen before.

Communities have raised money themselves, but predominantly there has been a large amount of public cash. However, what is important to recognise is that once purchased, that land is available in perpetuity for that community to make a living from. What is also important to understand, and I touched on this earlier, is that you can then use that asset against which to borrow and grow the value of that land against which you could potentially borrow more to invest, the relevant spirit that Angus Robertson said, so that ultimately—not ultimately but as quickly as possible—the community is free of public subsidy to any great extent in terms of its core costs and so on, and therefore can survive on its own. But in order to get to that point, we do require monetary help with the purchase of land. We think that should continue and it is entirely justifiable.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q126 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sir James Paice:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> You think you can justify that to the ordinary taxpayer, who is contributing in one way or another </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Peter Peacock</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">: I have not found, really, any taxpayer resistance to that at all. I have found taxpayer to all sorts of other public subsidies. In that book I was referring to that Jim Hunter has written, I think it is in that book that he quotes the amount of money spent on community land purchases in Scotland, which secures the land in perpetuity, is roughly equivalent to one day’s spending on agricultural subsidies, like on forestry and everything else. So you have to see this in context. On the face of it, a £4 million grant from the lottery or something to help buy an island or a piece of land, a big estate, seems like a lot of money. In the context of history it is not a lot of money if it provides the basis for that community securing its own future and being less dependent on public subsidy long term than it currently would be.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q127 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> Leaving aside the question of agricultural subsidies, in which we have an interest as well—and I heard, Angus, what you were doing— can you just clarify for us how much money was put upfront for your takeover? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Angus Robertson</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">: £330,000 was the purchase of the forest.

What I am trying to clarify is the balance for the public sector. If you have taken all these people into employment and in the event paying taxes and generating money for a variety of things, whether it is VAT and all the rest of it, taking them off the dole queue and the like, for £165,000, if that is the total public subsidy or contribution, that presumably would end up being repaid to the public purse through a variety of different channels in a relatively short period of time. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Angus Robertson</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">: Indeed, yes. Even just on our commercial loans that we have, we are trying to pay that back within five years. That is to commercial high-street banks to pay that back. We have not looked at the return of investment. It is something we plan to do on the funds that we have, particularly in the forest area. I should also mention that we are multi-project trust, so the purchase of our community petrol station was through a lottery-funded application, which was £230,000. Particularly our land asset was through three loans with three grant funds.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q131 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> I think it would be helpful. Jim raises a legitimate point. Leaving aside the question of comparing what is given out in agricultural subsidies, the question of how quickly projects like this wash their face in terms of contribution back to the public sector would be immensely helpful in arguing whether or not much more money could be made available. Presumably at the moment, given it is seen as giving away money, expenditure rather than investment, then obviously there is going to be a constraint about how much money is allocated to that, whereas where it is seen as an investment, then different criteria could very well come into play. Therefore, the issue 1 million acres and so on becomes more realistic, particularly taking into account the point that was made then about the Public Works Loan Board and whether or not you add on to the amount of money that could be available to free money, money that could be lent, and taking into account the question of a land agency and so on, you are then starting to have completely different paradigms altogether. I am not quite clear whether or not any work has been done on that. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Peter Peacock</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">: You make a very good point. In fact, one of the things that surprised me, coming into this area of work comparatively recently, is how little of that kind of data there is. We have just started doing a very small piece of work to begin to scope out how we look at this in much more detail to get some of the answers to the question you have asked, because I think we do need more data in that, and we will be happy to share the results of that as soon as we get it.

It is much less easy to know what tax allowance you got on the private estate you just bought. That is taxpayer money as well. Hopefully, the work we can do in that will also shed light on that, because the sums might be even greater there but they are not seen.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> I think we understand that point. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q132 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jim McGovern:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> You said community ownership tends to replicate the existing typical pattern of land ownership in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">, with large estates that once in community ownership are expected to remain in community ownership. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Peter Peacock</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">: Again I think that the great difference between the large estate that was in single ownership, private hands, a few years ago and is now in community ownership is that the future of that land is determined by the community collectively.

However, there are interesting things happening within that, in that some community owners are creating new tenancies for crofting, for forest crofts. They are creating smaller landholdings and estates and so on for individuals. I don’t think it is at all beyond the bounds of possibility that as the years evolve you will see further land reform within community-owned areas of land, which might open up other opportunities for other people within the community to take a direct personal stake in some of the land.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The framework of it might be a permanent existence, so to speak, but I think within that you are going to see that evolve over time.

It is evolving, but our first objective is to get more land into the ownership of communities where they can get the real benefits that we are seeing in places like Sleat.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q133 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lindsay Roy:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> You have almost answered the last question as well.

I think there is scope for that, not just within community-owned estates, potentially, but also much more generally. Whether communities would be the right vehicle to make purchases for that purpose or whether the state should do that or the local authority or a development agency is maybe a slightly different question.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q135 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lindsay Roy:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> Would you have answered that one very much the same, Angus? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Angus Robertson</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">: More </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">or</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> less.
