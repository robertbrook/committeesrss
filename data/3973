Legal Assessors are not decision makers but they advise the panel on the legal issues when they hear disciplinary cases against doctors. The view of the MPTS is that they have panel members who are sufficiently experienced so one could do away with lawyers (Legal Assessors). No amount of experience is enough for some people because:</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 54pt; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">a)</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Their experience is not of the kind required by the case before them, and it is not possible to predict all the legal issues that would arise during the hearing.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 54pt; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">b)</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Some people that GMC accept to judge doctors are not fit to judge anyone. For example, exorcists, religious extremists, those who fail to declare their conflict of interests contrary to GMC’s policy on declaration of interests. D4J sent extensive evidence to GMC and MPTS on corrupt Fitness to Practise Panellists. GMC refused to take any action at all. We had very high hopes in judge Pearl when he was appointed to chair MPTS. When it was pointed to MPTS (Judge Pearl) and </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">GMC that relevant interests were not declared by FTP panellists GMC’s response was that not all interests need to be declared. Yes, amazing, but that is </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">sooooooo</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> GMC. They remain fiercely protective of their own. The best place for a doctor to hide (someone who has done something wrong and could fear disciplinary proceedings against him/her by GMC) is to become Fitness to Practise Panellist. It would be illegal to provide written certification of protection but it is not something GMC needs to do: It is as if there has been unspoken agreement between parties: you look after us and we shall look after you. It is immensely frustrating for doctors, patients, relatives, carers and friends when they hit the GMC wall of obstruction. Judge Pearl never responded if he read the submissions which included evidence of fraud by panellist.  Amazingly, both GMC and MPTS have been so defiant that they went on to extend the contract of one panellists well beyond all the rules and regulations and of course, the law which is against corruption and fraud. One allegation of fraud was that of use of NHS facilities for private practise without the permission of Secretary of State for Health and contrary to NHS Act(s). We calculated that just in one case it was about £50,000 lost to NHS and if this has been done by a number of doctors then NHS is losing millions every year because of this failure to apply the law.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">  TWENTY TIMES INCREASED MORTALITY IN DOCTORS INVESTIGATED BY THE GMC  COMPARED TO THE NORMAL WORKING POPULATION</span></p><ol start="5" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">D4J has investigated mortality in doctors subject to fitness to practise investigations by the GMC and found that the mortality rate is about twenty times higher than in normal working age population. A request was made under Freedom of Information Act 2000 to GMC for the disclosure of the names of these doctors and their ethnicity. GMC disclosed that 92 (later corrected by them to 91) doctors died from 2004 until mid-April 2012 while investigated by them and before there was any fitness to practise hearing. GMC refused to disclose the names of the dead doctors claiming it would impair their regulatory function if they did disclose the names and that relatives would be distressed by the disclosure (no evidence of this presented in court) and claimed absolute exemption under FOIA by relying on qualified exemption (yes, they would try anything). The GMC claimed that ethnicity was not known in about 70% of the dead doctors. D4J took GMC to court for the breach of FOIA and Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. We were told by The First Tier Tribunal (Information Rights) that we could expect the decision at the end of November but it seems to be taking a bit longer for the judgement to come through. D4J would like a confidential inquiry to be conducted into those 100 or so deaths. A petition was signed by 2110 people, mostly by doctors, we think (we cannot see the signatures on Government Website for the petitions).</span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Further request to GMC under FOIA revealed the abnormalities in the dead population: 90% were men.

Paranoia was diagnosed without any reference to diagnostic criteria or the facts of the case. Doctor suffered with anxiety. Interim Order Panel hearing put conditions on his practise making the decision not to publish the conditions relating to health. However, the panel secretary decided she did not like those health conditions not being published and organized a different panel within a week or so. One can imagine the stress on the doctor who just had one hearing and who is also in full time NHS employment. D4J was able to help this doctor by using human rights arguments.

Despite the deficiencies in the survey questions the relevant issues were raised in the survey answers and with GMC and once again they ignored it completely. Now, it is fourteen years how GMC have essentially colluded in what amounts to breech of Article 10 of European Convention on Human Rights. Psychiatrists do not wear white coats and nurses do not wear uniforms because it creates a barrier to communication and trust. GMC do know that but they would do everything they can to abuse their power by failing to set up proper ethical guidance and also by persecuting doctor(s) who put patients interests first. Men raped by clergy, for example, do not fit the male macho image GMC have of themselves. They do not want to acknowledge male rape or the psychological/social/financial/occupational consequences these criminal activities </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">have on men long-term, how hard it is for male victims of rape to open up on these issues to health workers and that having mental health workers dressed in nun’s habit or as a priest has negative effect on the reporting of the crimes. D4J has contacted network of victims of abuse by clergy and they fully agreed that uniforms are detrimental in mental health. Research on patients’ opinion was conducted in UK about the issue of religious uniforms and it found patients thought of religious uniforms as off-putting. The research was condemned by GMC as serious professional misconduct! It is very easy for GMC to eliminate any doctor, any time, because they appear to have an army of religious fanatics ready to step in and judge the “deviant” doctors.

They do not need the powers to test as they already have the power to ask for the certificates in proficiency to be presented to them as a condition for registration. GMC like other equivalent European institutions can make sure they do not expose the public to any risk due to poor language ability of registered doctors. D4J have noticed that now GMC’s  case investigators are asking foreign doctors when did they plan to take the test in language proficiency (appropriately, so) but these doctors are already registered (through GMC’s own lack of interest to do things properly in the first place) and have complaints against them.
