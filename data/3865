line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Background:- </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Traditional electrical apprenticeship and 32 years in the trade.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">In brief.  I think that the electrical industry has become bloated with red tape and officialdom, while simultaneously being de-skilled to the point </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">that most electrical installation work is now being done by labourers with no proper understanding of the characteristics of electricity.  Most modern electrical certificates are little more than a disclaimer of liability for the training company and emplo</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">yer.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Part P.  Nothing more than a profitable racket.  Any homeowner should be allowed to do electrical work in their own property without having to pay for the right or be forced to employ someone who may be less skilled than they are.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">One of the most stun</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">ning results of the Part P disaster is that lots of electrically incompetent individuals now believe they are fully certified electricians.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">You also have the ridiculous situation where an industrial electrician</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> like myself with 32 years in the electrical in</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">dustry and a vast electrical/electronic knowledge to match is not allowed to do electrical work in my own house without approval, while a self employed handyman with minimal electrical knowledge is "Part P certified" and can.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">SJIB.  Formerly quite a credib</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">le certifying body.  I can recall how proud I was as an apprentice to receive my grade card (with no expiry/renewal date at that time).  Now it's just another organisation cashing in on short duration certificates</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> that you have to renew regularly while also</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> doing patronising safety tests at further expense.  Their whole grading system is now full of watered down sub-grades to pander to the new era of de-skilling industry.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">NICEIC.    In my personal opinion the NICEIC is a private, profit making organisation t</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">hat presented itself as a standards agency and used heavy marketing to imply that only organisations it approved should be used to do electrical work.  Add the catch-22 situation that anyone applying for approval had to have been trading for 2 years (hard </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">when you can't get work because you're not approved by them) and a requirement that you had "proper" industrial trading premises (hard when you're just starting out as self employed) and you actually have a protection racket that served large contractors b</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">y making it hard for newly formed companies to start business.  I know this because I applied for approval when I went self employed about twenty years ago and was forced to become a freelance </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">electrican</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> instead for those very reasons.   Of course, now the</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">y'll approve anyone who provides suitable certification (a cheque) and does one of the lucrative "instant electrician" courses.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The "one competent person per company" has been shockingly abused by generic construction and facility management companies who </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">quite literally have just one electrically competent person.  Their role appears to be to try and clean up the mess left by the incompetent persons.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Meter calibration.  There is absolutely no need for test equipment to be calibrated every single year.  The</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> requirement of certification of calibration on test certificates has turned this into yet another expensive racket.  Domestic and industrial wiring does not require military precision.  If </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">a meter drifts by a few percent on its ohm or </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">megohm</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> ranges then i</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">t is still perfectly usable to get an accurate reading.  Most meters will not drift by more than one percent over their entire lifespan unless misused severely, and this could be tested by the commonly available "proving box" that simply contains two high </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">precision resistors as reference.  An alternative to yearly calibration could be for testers to use the proving box before each set of tests and write the measured values in a designated space.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt;
