Fiscal pressures and demographic changes have made new demands on public services.

It is this choice which has empowered citizens to tailor services according to their individual needs. Public services no longer abide by the maxim ‘the man in Whitehall really does know best’; instead individuals are able to choose what works best for them. Recognising that more could be done, the Government asked David Boyle to conduct an independent review into the barriers to choice in public services, with a particular focus on those most disadvantaged.

However, rather than dictate the public service agenda the Government seeks to be an enabler in establishing a framework within which public service ownership is devolved to the lowest level possible. With this in mind, and using the Open Public Services framework, Secretaries of State are able to drive reform at a departmental level whilst local authorities will have fewer restrictions on funding, less regulation and performance management from Whitehall, and new opportunities to raise revenue. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The Government has rightly emphasised transparency and a greater use of evidence which better equips Secretaries of State and local authorities to make the best decisions. For example, Data.gov.uk has now collated over 10,000 datasets making them available online, informing officials on the performance of a service and allowing them to analyse and benchmark their performance against other public services. Additionally, the six What Works centres will accrue and assess the most robust information on where public money should be directed to improve public services. Two existing centres of excellence – the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the Educational Endowment Foundation will be joined by four new independent institutions on tackling crime; promoting active and independent ageing; effective early intervention; and the What Works Local Economic Growth centre that launched last month.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">An integrated approach between these different tiers of the public sector is necessary in order to deliver public services well, particularly those supporting vulnerable individuals and families. This has been clearly demonstrated by the work of the Whole Place Community Budget pilots (established by the Government in four areas in 2011). For example, London’s Tri-borough </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">(Westminster, Hammersmith and Fulham, and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea)</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">identified that 20% of the local population with the most serious health conditions</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">accounted for 77% of health and social care costs. With that knowledge, they then designed integrated health and</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">social care centres to reduce the costs of caring for them. Research for the Local Government Association has estimated that if the same approaches were rolled out nationwide, the public sector could make</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">up to £20.6 billion in net savings over five years.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">This same, integrated approach is also demonstrating clear benefits in the Troubled Families programme. </span><span style="background-color:#ffffff; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Government data collected in October and November 2011 estimated that £9 billion is spent annually on troubled families – an average of £75,000 per family each year. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The programme (costing £448 million over three years) has generated </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">positive early results</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">by using payment by results to incentivise more integrated working with these families by local services</span><span style="background-color:#ffffff; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Despite the benefits of joined-up working, it remains challenging in practice.
