NAHT has members in a number of academies and free schools and has always supported the principle of diversity of provision. </span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; margin:5pt 0pt 12pt 31.72pt; padding-left:3.98pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Increased school autonomy and significant budget cuts have undoubtedly had a negative impact on the ability of many local authorities to co-ordinate the provision of school places in an equitable and efficient way.</span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; margin:5pt 0pt 12pt 35.7pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Local Authorities are not able to direct academies to increase or decrease their planned admission numbers depending on local demand, nor are they able to prevent free schools opening in their area. Should ‘rival’ schools open and take a proportion of pupils away, this does not reduce the fixed costs of running their schools and so money is drained from the system. They are prevented by statute from opening new community schools (as all new schools must be academies) as so can be powerless to address emerging patterns of population growth or decline.  </span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; margin:5pt 0pt 12pt 35.7pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">We are concerned that of the free schools opened or due to open by 2014 and beyond, just 25 primary schools have been set up in areas where there is currently a shortage of school places, and 87 in areas where there is </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">currently </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">a surplus</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">. However, we are pleased to see that</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> most of these are being opened in some of the areas identified as likely to be the worst affected by school place shortages in 2016/17.</span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; margin:5pt 0pt 12pt 35.7pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Parent choice is often cited as a key driver for the provision of free schools but one specific area where parental choice is neglected is the specialist provision for children with special educational needs and disabilities. Indeed, the co-ordination of provision for children with SEND across local authority areas is something we would urge the committee to consider with some care.   </span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; margin:5pt 0pt 12pt 35.7pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Parents of primary aged pupils need to be able to access a school within reasonable travelling distance (preferably walking distance) from their home. It is also important for parents that siblings can attend the same school and that term dates and drop off/collection times are co-ordinated. The pressure on primary school places increases the likelihood that parents will have children in different schools and consequently makes it more important than ever that term dates and the length of the school day are subject to local co-ordination.  </span></li><li style="color:#222222; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; margin:5pt 0pt 12pt 35.7pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="color:#222222; font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">In addition to the immediate problem of the primary school place shortage, we hope that the committee will also consider the impact that admissions appeals and mid-year transfers have on the ability of schools to plan and co-ordinate provision.
