We’re in the pre-election phase of the political cycle at Westminster. Partisanship strengthens, commitment to parliament’s corporate goals may weaken and ministers’ and whips’ sensitivity to criticism grows more acute. Now is a moment to anticipate the expansion of scrutiny of the executive in the next parliament by embedding the Wright reforms, and using the post-2010 performance of select committees to push for more.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> Thanks, to the work of the Public Accounts, Treasury and Public Administration committees, we know much more about strains within the executive, particularly yawning gaps in civil service capacity, deficits in the conventional model of ministerial performance and dysfunctions both in policy making and securing effectiveness, efficiency and economy in central government operations. Add to those the pending effects on Whitehall and Westminster of further devolution within the United Kingdom, let alone Scottish independence and the prospect of large-scale revision of the relationship of the UK and the European Union. Select committee examination of executive performance is both a cause of the widespread sense of crisis for Whitehall’s old verities and a source of remedies and reforms.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> But that prospect depends on select committee behaviour and capacity.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> This submission rests on my regular commentary and reportage on Whitehall and public management.

Perhaps the Liaison Committee could be more of a vehicle for inter-committee communication; perhaps informal conversation between chairs is enough …Either way, committees should liaise more on agendas and themes and witnesses. It’s common to see witnesses from interest group X appearing before one committee this week and before another the next, repeating their evidence. </span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Committees duplicate each other. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) examines a department’s accounting officer. The same civil servant, in the guise of permanent secretary, appears before the committee examining the department’s annual report and accounts and goes over the same ground. There are two ways forward, recognising that money (lack of it) will be the principal characteristic of public affairs for years to come. One would be to recognise the PAC’s leading role in financial scrutiny and slot the departmental select committees in behind it; another would be closer liaison and a cleverer division of labour between the PAC and committees, allowing it to focus on finance and committees on policy. See below for a note on the role and limitations of the National Audit Office (NAO).</span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Committees should be more strategic approach to their scrutiny of Whitehall departments in particular and the performance of the central executive at large. Health is not just a theme for MPs interested in the Department of Health – morbidity and mortality are affected by markets, housing, employment and so on. The division of labour between committees still too often reflects the pathology of Whitehall’s debilitating lack of joinedupness.</span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">A similar point applies to scrutiny of government outside Whitehall. What councils do is not just a subject for Communities and Local Government – but to avoid duplication of effort and imposing extra burdens on councillors and officers committees should come together more. How many joint hearings are held? Too few.</span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Examples of how the Commons itself is disjointed might include MPs’ approach to the referendum on Scottish independence.

It’s partly the role of the Comptroller &amp; Auditor General, who is an officer in but not of parliament. What determines the NAO’s programme of studies and investigations, so valuable in establishing fact and pointing out under performance? There’s negotiation between the C&amp;AG and the chair of the PAC but the NAO itself sometimes seems to lack a strategy. The Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011 changed the NAO’s governance but did little to clarify its accountability. </span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Are other parliamentary resources aligned with select committee inquiries?

They are now a ‘power in the land’, attracting more attention and not just for showcase hearings. Select committee chairs have become a new class of political personality, enjoying positive reputations and autonomous standing; they generate trust in the system and, as important, the system’s capacity to police itself through scrutiny. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> But</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Committee chairs are still under-serviced. They have simultaneously to carry out their day-to-day functions as constituency MPs, attend to the business of the House and run complex and demanding committees and are expected to do all this on a shoestring. </span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The case for extra spending on committees and especially on assistance for their chairs is one that the government has already accepted in principle. It’s called invest to save. Scrutiny of executive performance will in most instances turn up recommendations for qualitative improvement in policy and its delivery and/or quantitative reductions in the cost of government. Committee work is mostly about increasing government’s effectiveness. </span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Committees have access to research services from the House of Commons Library but – as the Liaison Committee has noted – have till now not commissioned external research, from academics or thinktanks or consultants. Yet the stuff of public policy and management gets more complex, whether it’s banking regulation, nuclear decommissioning or the interaction of tax and benefits. Experts can be called as witnesses but committees may need more dedicated support. And that would have to be paid for. </span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> Yet the government has accepted the need to augment one area of applied policy research, in appraising public spending and budgeting trends. The Office for Budget Responsibility was established outside parliament when, in other countries, budget offices have been embedded inside the legislature. The government has so far resisted suggestions that the OBR become an instrument of scrutiny, for example subjecting parties’ manifestos to appraisal. But when the performance of the OBR over the five years of this parliament is evaluated, the gap between its work and that of the Treasury Committee, the PAC and others may appear anomalous and wasteful. Perhaps the Liaison Committee itself should commission that evaluation. </span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The OBR is part of a family of organisations that do not fit neatly into constitutional diagrams. Its members include the NAO and the UK Statistics Authority and – at least till its final demise – the Audit Commission. Their identity is formed from their independence, yet they are creatures of statute and depend for their income on parliamentary vote; also their functions overlap and mesh with those of parliament itself as the scrutineer of executive action and the vehicle for whistleblowers. (Timely intervention by the Public Administration Select Committee secured a chair for the UK Statistics Authority who has won wide praise for his clarity and robustness.) A review of the respective functions of select committees and these freestanding audit, budget and data organisations is overdue and the Liaison Committee might commission one – or at least ask the government to.</span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Conclusion.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The fate of select committees for the rest of this decade and perhaps beyond is to help deal with financial stringency by reshaping and refitting government – by scrutinising what government does with vigour and the practical knowledge that comes from seeing how policies affect members’ constituents day in, day out. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> That implies much of the business of select committees will be financial. From that follows the salience of committees and inquiries that specialise in the financial function and the necessity of joining up scrutiny of the effectiveness and efficiency of spending with examinations of policy intentions and delivery. It may also imply the need for all select committee members to be more financial literate – for the NAO to offer basic instruction in accounting and the UK Statistics Authority basic grounding in statistics and data analysis. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> Another conclusion is about parliament seeing itself both as unique, which of course it is as the fountainhead of democratic participation and procedure, and as part of a conjoint effort to improve governance. Select committees are – ought to be – umbilically linked to the specialists in the NAO, OBR and UK Statistics Authority. Parliament might at some stage want to rationalise that architecture. One day MPs might, like in other countries, want to establish a performance and budget office inside the legislature. For the time being, much more could be done to link together the energy and political acumen displayed by select committees and the professional knowledge and disinterestedness of these external scrutineers.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">29 November 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
