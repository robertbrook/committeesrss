The Personal Independent Payments will mean that it will have to be included in the assessment of a PIP. Who will ensure this takes place ? GP Consortiums do not seem willing to give any grant for a transport service to t</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">heir clinics. Many Acute hospitals are now specialising. In a rural area like the South West, as well as the choice of hospital, means the number of long journeys is now increasing. The NHS transport service is not mandatory for appointments unless people </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">with mobility problems or live in isolated rural communities need treatment whilst travelling. This is increasing the need for specialised transport.
