As the Police and Crime Commissioner for Northumbria I have enjoyed a challenging yet rewarding year. Here is an outline of the current arrangements in Northumbria which we feel are being demonstrated to be effective as a means of governance and we would like to add that the position of PCC as a whole is far more dynamic than anything attainable under the former Police Authorities. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The effectiveness of commissioners in reducing crime and delivering an effective police service</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">As you will know, crime is rising nationally.

The existence of PCCs is increasingly well known and we not only have a lot of correspondence on policing issues but attend hundreds of groups to discuss and our pre-PC Plan consultation was widely taken up. They are aware that there has been a significant shift of power to them in that, historically, while police may have been open to consultation they are now obliged to respond effectively to the public's issues raised by me, since I hold wide powers and control their budget.

I hold regular meetings with the Chief constable and I would consider that, although we do not always agree, we have a strong and effective relationship and can disagree while retaining mutual respect.  By attending the senior management board meetings I have the opportunity to watch over the CC's own monthly exercise in performance management and planning within the force work and I hear first-hand experiences from the area commanders and other department heads within the force. I am then able to raise any issues of concern to me from those meetings, with the CC herself at our fortnightly joint business meetings.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Detailed quarterly performance meetings are held at OPCC and this provides a further opportunity to challenge performance and consider the delivery of the police and crime plan and the Chief Constables delivery plan in close detail looking at progress against key objectives, actions and targets. This regular challenge gives me a chance to ensure that the priorities and issues identified by local people are delivered with objectives and actions. This meeting is attended by me, the DPCC and the Chief Executive.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">In addition, we get a view from 'the coalface' through the DPCC, a former police officer, who engages with Neighbourhood Teams and 24/7 officers to understand the operational impact and the workability of our plans to ensure that we are providing what we intend - the best service to local communities.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">As two organisations the OPCC and Northumbria Police work to a joint business cycle which is progressed and developed through fortnightly business meetings with the OPCC management and the Chief Constable and her team.

Some, but not all, local leading councillors on the Panel found it hard to replace their own geographical political and economic interests with the duty to scrutinise the PCC, in particular around funding for Community Safety Partnerships and setting the precept. I suspect that, contrary to what I first thought, if, as is now the case in some parts of Northumbria, council leaders are not the panel representatives but councillors who have experience of overview and scrutiny that might be better achieved. (I can engage with council leaders through other channels and I provide both councillors and MP’s with a regular email newsletter.) We ask members of the Panel to come along to events and visits in their areas to try to strengthen our relationship and their understanding of some of my issues.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The division of functions and staff between commissioners and chief constables following the stage 2 transfers under the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011</span><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">From Northumbria I have submitted the following proposal, following consultation with the Chief Constable and the Northumbria Police Unison and GMB branches. I have proposed the ‘maximum transfer option’. The outcome of this, if approved, will be that a small core staff in the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner (OPCC) will support me directly in fulfilling my statutory role and all the warranted and non-warranted police staff that I currently employ will transfer into the employment of the Chief Constable at 23:59hrs on 31 March 2014. This transfer of 1,846 staff will be carried out in in accordance with the Cabinet Statement of Practice on Staff Transfers in the public sector. This transfers my current rights, powers, duties and liabilities in connection with their employment contracts to the Chief Constable of Northumbria. Whilst I and the Chief Constable have distinctly separate roles and legal identities our functions are acknowledged to have interdependence, there is an explicit expectation and duty on every member of staff in Northumbria Police to provide the required services to both to myself and the Chief Constable to assist in fulfilling our joint responsibility in serving the public and to carry out their separate statutory functions. Notwithstanding the distinct legal identities and other obligations, my functions and those of the Chief Constable are acknowledged to have such interdependence as to permit the sharing of significant areas of business support that allows our distinct and separate roles to be carried out effectively and efficiently – and, in my own case to provide me with the resources to maintain strategic oversight of the Police performance and to hold the Chief Constable to account on behalf of the public. This will happen via the establishment of a Service Level Agreement which will allow for servicing such shared interests whilst, at the same time, providing each of us with the capacity to fulfil their different responsibilities. The sharing of these services will enable both myself and the Chief Constable to access support services when needed, enabling us to fulfil our duties and achieve better value for money.

I have established Advisory Groups covering all protected characteristics as part of the Equality Act 2010 and work with these groups to help promote the key priorities, commitments and actions that the Police and Crime Plan outline. The delivery of my plan is supported by planned media and social media campaigns helping to reach even more audiences and engage them in the future of policing in their area. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">In the summer of 2013 I put together a short leaflet for each area command summarising the work I have carried out since my election and the local policing priorities that will be focus in their local area.
