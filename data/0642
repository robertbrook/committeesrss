Apart from working at the ‘sharp end’ of discovery through laboratory and ‘in situ’ investigations, the use of remote sensing imagery obtained from satellites and sophisticated predictive computer modelling, PML is also involved in delivering knowledge exchange, providing this service for, amongst other projects the NERC, Defra, DECC funded UKOA project.

PML has gathered a unique multi-disciplinary team of individuals to its socio-economic group which investigates the value of marine goods and services and how they may be impacted in a changing climate – perception of risk, itself determined by knowledge of the likely consequences of climate change, is a key part of these investigations. Inevitably PML collaborates across a wide geographical area with a broad range of organisations ie UNEP, UK Met Office etc.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Relevant PML outputs:</span></p><ol start="3" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 13.25pt; padding-left:22.75pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Apart from its impressive scientific publication record, including many peer reviewed articles around the subject of CO</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:7.33pt; vertical-align:sub">2</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> and ocean acidification, PML has also been involved in the production of a range of materials and participated in many activities for a wider public consumption:</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="4" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 13.25pt; padding-left:22.75pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">As part of the EPOCA Project PML instigated and was a major contributor to various publications including: ‘Frequently asked questions about ocean acidification’; ‘Ocean acidification, questions answered’; ‘Ocean acidification: the knowledge base’ – all intended to provide accessible, factual information about OA to a wide stakeholder community.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Audiences for engagement and public understanding</span></p><ol start="5" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 13.25pt; padding-left:22.75pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The general public is not a single group but an amalgam of differing interests and experiences, as such there is no one-size-fits-all approach to science communication and any attempt at sharing understanding of a topic requires a targeted approach.

For many people the subject is still too inaccessible, too far into the future and too far away, geographically, to worry about. Anecdotal feedback suggests that the ‘public’ often think that climate change cannot be happening because of the reluctance of scientists to highlight single events as CC-caused, or because of the perceived reluctance of governments to take significant action. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="12" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18.75pt; padding-left:17.25pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">In more detail there is still confusion between climate and weather. There appears to be a sense of resignation that even if CC is understood that there is little that the individual can do – it is too big to make a difference – in which case ‘the government will pay the scientists to sort it out’. There is also the feeling that ‘what is the point if China keeps building new coal fired power stations’. A slightly more cynical but still real perception amongst some is that climate change is being used as an opportunity to ‘tax’ people, or to keep scientists in a job. In short there is still confusion of message, consequences, remedial actions and relevance to the individual. This is further exacerbated by a confusion of motive on behalf of those who should be leading (government, scientists). </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Which voices are trusted in public discourse on climate science and policy?

Trust is a commodity hard gained and easily lost – another reason for the reluctance of scientists to become embroiled in ‘public engagement’. Lessons can be learned from other branches of science, which whilst not so potentially worrying are none-the-less complex and difficult to understand. ‘Champions’ have proved of considerable worth: Sir David Attenborough is the perfect example of someone who can ‘carry a crowd’ and who has recently begun to draw attention to how climate and other changes are impacting the natural environment he has encouraged us all to care for. Brian Cox, is a fine example of how a personality, and a down-to-earth approach, can suddenly make a generation of TV viewers keen to soak up astrophysics, to such an extent that there is still a hunger from the media and public for a diet of largely inaccessible physics! The press and media are hugely influential and when combined with such champions can change attitudes. Climate change requires such a media friendly champion.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="14" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18.75pt; padding-left:17.25pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">PML has engaged with a wide cross section of the ‘public’ through special events in the House of Lords and the House of Commons for policy makers and business leaders; across the wide swathe of public to primary school children through Science Ambassadors; video and popular articles on CO</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:7.33pt; vertical-align:sub">2</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> related phenomena and many web-based ‘offerings’ are part of PML’s arsenal for communicating science to the broadest possible audiences.

Essential is a consistency of message across all strata of society to avoid confusion, this requires a coordinated approach across the organisations and institutes engaged in CC communications, to provide clear, accurate information to all outlets but especially the press and media.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">How could public understanding of what is meant by climate change be improved?

This must have led the ‘public’ to think that scientific opinion was also balanced, for and against, an interesting occurrence where ‘balance’ creates an untruth.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="17" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18.75pt; padding-left:17.25pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Most public surveys reveal that people gain most of their information, and some opinion, from the media.

PML experience illustrates this fact with prominent environmental journalists becoming fatigued with the same old stories from a wide range of organisations, still lacking substance of impact and consequence of CC. The process of science is not geared (nor should it be) to providing major headlines, however there is a need for scientists to begin to recognise the potential public interest of their research. Scientists are often reluctant to engage with the media – often due to the idea that journalists will not understand the nuances of their science, or that the scientists simply mistrust the journalists to report fairly. These barriers still exist but with more specialist science journalism the understanding and trust has been growing. More recently specialist science communicators have begun to bridge the gap between scientists and journalists, ensuring journalists are given the best and most relevant information, while the scientists gain confidence that their science is being presented in the best possible way. PML has been active in creating a communications group charged with just such aims.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">How important is public understanding in developing effective climate change policy?  What evidence is there that public attitude to climate science affects their engagement with energy policies or initiatives?</span></p><ol start="19" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18.75pt; padding-left:17.25pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">There is no doubt that a belief in climate change is essential if mitigation strategies for reducing carbon dioxide are to be supported across a wider public.
