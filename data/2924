My estimate is that about 80% are responded to in six weeks and 20% need a chase up. The chase ups are usually effective with responses then coming within a week. However, there are a few exceptions which need continual chase up; the Home Office – immigration matters being a particular example.

Some responses provide detailed information for the constituent, answer any specific questions asked and will even add some helpful information.  </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">On the other hand, some responses merely reiterate policy and avoid answering all, or even any, of the questions which have been asked. It is difficult to pass such replies to constituents, although I always offer constituents the opportunity to get back to discuss further and I will write to the Minister again.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">My staff make use of the parliamentary </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">helplines</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> as often as possible. Government agencies such as the Child Support Agency (CSA), UK Border Agency (UKBA) and HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) for example, have become very good at dealing with specific constituent cases. If the issue is one of policy and the Agencies hands are tied, then I will go to the Minister. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The frustration comes when the reply from the Minister merely repeats the mantra of government aims rather than addressing the points raised which show that the policy intent is not being achieved. I would have thought that these inquiries would have provided useful feedback to Ministers when a policy is not working as intended. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">In discussing Ministerial replies with my staff we agreed that we would try and ask much more specific points– perhaps even bullet pointing each separate question.

Agencies appear to be much more responsive to complaints, but they are in general easier scapegoats. Ultimately, responsibility lies with the ministers and senior officials, as very often the root of the concerns lie with policy.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">I understand that the UKBA for example pass on statistical information as way of feedback. I do not believe this provides a clear picture of how policy is working on the ground. This form of feedback does not allow for those implementing policy to provide an accurate picture of their experiences and the impact – positive or negative – of changes. In fact this does not even allow for Ministers to be really aware if their aims are reaping the hoped for benefits/targets.  Statistics may be easier to achieve.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">There is a wealth of experience on the ‘shop floor’ but much of this is not conveyed or sought by the decision makers.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">Hilary Benn MP</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline"> (response from office staff/caseworker)</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">I have noticed an improvement and it seems to me that we are now receiving departmental replies more promptly.

In both of these instances a local service exists for raising constituent complaints and the vast majority of our cases are directed here. However there are times when I as an MP feel that a case needs to be looked at by a Minister for specific reasons but when I do raise these with the Minister they are often redirected back to local teams or generic complaints bodies. This is particularly difficult with DWP cases where often the complaints team struggle to deal with complaints with the level of over view I think is required and it therefore becomes very difficult to highlight systemic problems or problems with wider implications or to challenge existing decisions. I do think that there does need to </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">be more clarity in being able to refer situations to Ministers and I also think that this could prevent the need for submitting questions and requesting meetings about individual cases. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">Cathy Jamieson MP</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline"> (response from office staff/caseworker)</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 10.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">There is </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">inconsistency between different departments, in terms of how they receive, acknowledge and respond to correspondence. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 10.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">There is inconsistency in the way that email and hard copy correspondence is dealt with between departments</span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 10.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">It is often difficult to get correspondence replied to in the appropriate timescales.
