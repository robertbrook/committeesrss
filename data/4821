Observations on the fact that likely large population exposure to BSE has so far led to only a relatively small number of human vCJD cases (even taking into account potentially long incubation periods and the known effects of the genetic </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">PRNP</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">-129 polymorphism), combined with experimental animal study results, suggested that (fortunately) there was a significant inter-species barrier to transmission from cattle to humans via the dietary route. However, these data suggested also that prolonged, or even life-long, subclinical infection isa probable outcome of dietary exposure to BSE, with these ‘silently’ affected individuals being a potential source of infection. This concern was heightened by the fact that secondary transmission would be intra-species with no inter-species barrier and, indeed, probable species-adaptation. If secondary transmission were to occur, it could be via: neurosurgery or ophthalmic surgery, other surgery (including dentistry), blood and or products, and organ or tissue transplants. Experience with prion human diseases strongly suggests that other, more ordinary, contact would pose no risk and that neurosurgery or ophthalmic surgery would carry the largest risk. Other transmission routes had not been definitively implicated (apart from human cadaveric derived hormone treatments). Indeed, in relation to blood, past studies had failed to identify a risk associated with sporadic CJD and early animal experimental studies with vCJD showed no disease transmission. Despite this potentially reassuring background, it was recognised that vCJD was a novel prion disease and the previous studies had limitations. Therefore, at an early stage in the UK vCJD epidemic, various measures were put in place, including a study to identify any instances of human-human transmission by blood [see TMER below]. It should be noted that the UK CJD Surveillance system was obtaining data about blood donation and transfusion exposure for all referred cases from 1990 onwards (and, indeed, had done so in a past study in England and Wales).</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">A2: EPIDEMIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE FOR INFECTIVITY IN BLOOD AND BLOOD PRODUCTS, TISSUES AND ORGANS. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">A theoretical risk of human vCJD transmission by blood, organs or tissues, whether or not supported by animal experimentation, is not as powerful an argument for concern as the demonstration of its actual occurrence. A variety of inter-related surveillance and epidemiological approaches were adopted to attempt to detect such occurrences:   the identification of links between cases (the Transfusion Medicine Epidemiological Review, enhanced surveillance of people exposed to TSE risks, other look-back studies, cluster analysis and other incidental investigations of, for example, surgical or occupational exposures) as well as risk factor analysis (case-control studies).</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Underpinning all of these approaches is effective clinico-pathological surveillance for cases and obtaining good data on potential risk factors for disease (see www.cjd.ed.ac.uk), The NCJDRSU is integral to these processes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">In 2003, the surveillance system identified a case of CJD with a blood transfusion history and the TMER study confirmed linkage to a CJD-affected donor, with other cases identified subsequently (details below). </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">A separate study of potentially exposed haemophilia patients (examining their tissues  for evidence of disease-related prion protein) has identified one instance of vCJD infection being most likely  transmitted by a blood product (factor VIII). </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">To date, no other instance of actual human-to-human transmission has been identified.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">RELEVANT STUDIES:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">TRANSFUSION MEDICINE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL REVIEW (TMER)</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">In the UK, all vCJD cases over 17 years of age are notified by NCJDRSU to the UK blood services on diagnosis and a look-back is undertaken to identify the fate of all blood donations made by these cases. For vCJD cases with a known transfusion history, the hospital records are searched to identify blood donors. The details of identified recipients and donors are regularly cross-checked against the NCJDRSU surveillance register to identify links between cases [Ref 1]. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">It was in this way that three cases of transfusion associated vCJD have been detected, two of which were associated with a common blood donor [Refs 2,3,4]. A further instance of transfusion associated infection was also detected post-mortem in a blood recipient with no clinical symptoms of vCJD [Ref 5]. All four patients were recipients of non-leucodepleted red blood cells donated by asymptomatic individuals who subsequently went on to develop vCJD. There have been no new cases of transfusion-associated vCJD detected since 2006 (ie after the introduction of universal leucodepletion), but we remain vigilant to this possibility. The TMER is funded presently until 2015 but continued study is clearly of great importance and an extension of the study is planned but and further funding is necessary for this. The TMER addresses the critical issue of the extent of transfusion transmission of variant CJD and also provides data from look-back studies of blood transfusion in sporadic CJD and hereditary prion diseases. It also provides a mechanism for the notification of cases to the national blood authorities to enable subsequent public health actions to be taken in terms of withdrawal of implicated blood products, and contact identification and notification. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">ORGANS AND TISSUE LOOKBACK</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">With regard to organs and tissues, in vCJD the abnormal prion protein is widely dispersed throughout the body {Refs 6,7,8,9]]. Risk assessments on bone, organ and tissues indicate a potentially high risk to transplant recipients if the donor were infected with vCJD, depending on the relative infectivity of the tissue, the mass of the tissue and the site of transplant [Ref 10].</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">A medical look-back study has recently been undertaken by the NCJDRSU with the UK blood and transplant services to investigate whether UK cases could have contracted vCJD by receiving an organ or tissue transplant, or could have transmitted vCJD to others by this route. We have identified one situation to date, where an organ (liver) recipient had subsequently developed vCJD, the donor having died from causes unrelated to CJD. No links were detected between any of the other cases. A manuscript detailing the findings has been submitted for publication.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">As part of national surveillance activities the NCJDRSU will continue to give a high profile to asking about blood, organ and tissue donation and receipt, along with other surgical procedures into the future, and will continue to look for links between cases as part of our surveillance of risk factors for CJD. In addition, staff at NCJDRSU support local clinicians in their prompt referral of new and suspect CJD cases to local health protection teams for further public health investigations and follow-up of surgical procedures. This enables public health action to be taken, including for organ and tissue donation/ transplantation, in line with UK guidance (Ref 11).

There have been two major such studies reported in the UK, both of which were given research ethics approval requiring the use of anonymised samples from patients of known birth cohorts [Refs 16,17]. These were detailed in the submission to the committee from Professor Ironside. As he stated there, it is not unreasonable to conclude that the prevalence of subclinical vCJD infection in the UK may be around 1 in 2,000 of the population and that all genetic subgroups are susceptible.

[The question of non-specific staining is being addressed in an on-going DH-funded study of appendixes removed from the 1970s and earlier – before BSE is thought to have entered the human food chain. Immunohistochemistry has not detected accumulation of disease-associated prion protein in sections of appendixes, tonsils and spleens from individuals who have died from sCJD, although one report exists of very low levels of disease-associated prion protein detected in unfixed samples of the spleen in a subgroup of sCJD patients by Western blot assay, a method considered to have a greater sensitivity.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 20.4pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">(b)</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The positive results reported, if true positives, might give an underestimate of the prevalence of vCJD infection in the UK population, since immunohistochemistry is perhaps not as sensitive as other assays, e.g. Western blot, for the detection of disease-associated prion protein in tissues.

These data and assumptions will not be presented here as they are available in detailed reports (two principal reports being: ‘Blood-borne transmission of vCJD. Re-Examination of scenarios’.
