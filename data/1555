Green lanes are usually unsealed tracks (</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">eg</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> not covered with tarmac or concrete), and used by a wide variety of traffic. Historically they were always open to all traffic - perfectly sensible in the days of horses and carts, but highly damaging when used by today's modern sports utility vehicles.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Much time, effort and expense is exercised by various bodies </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">who</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> are monitoring the situation. Where damage to green lanes by four wheeled recreational vehicles is evident, applications for Traffic Regulation Orders are made. Where the local authority grants such orders, the green lane in question has time to 'heal' - often with the help of volunteers to infill ruts and puddles created by the recreational vehicles. But sadly such TRO's are often temporary, and once expired, the damage by these vehicles starts again. As so the whole process is repeated.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">It is patently clear that these green lanes are not designed for the types of vehicle now using them. Current legislation means that the prevention of such vehicles using these lanes is complicated by ‘red tape’. I feel that this is exactly the type of situation where the Deregulation Bill could have a beneficial effect.  I endorse the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance's proposal that:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">All unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs), and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs) should be recognised as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be re-classified as Restricted Byways.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Secondly, requests for Traffic Regulation Orders on green lanes can be turned down by local authorities, with no right of appeal by the applicant. This can be despite overwhelming evidence that the lanes are being irreparably damaged.

I have seen horse riders having to turn back simply because their passage is blocked by such damage. Restrictions on the use of green lanes are certainly beneficial to their wellbeing, but all the good that temporary TRO's do can be undone again within days, when they expire, and the damaging vehicles are allowed back.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">I believe that facilitating the preservation of our unspoilt countryside is an area where the Deregulation Bill could have a significant - and popular - effect.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">I fully support the formal submissions, which have been submitted to the scrutiny committee, by </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The Green Lanes Environmental Action Group (GLEAM), by the Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG), by the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA), and the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance (YDGLA).</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">28 August 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
