font-size:12pt">Select committees should influence policy and have an impact on Government departments and the agencies to which their functions may be devolved. This is our first objective. The extent of this influence and impact is the primary measure of the effectiveness of select committees. (Paragraph 12) </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">2. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">While committees' primary purpose is to scrutinise Government, it is sometimes in the public interest for them to extend their scrutiny to other organisations. (Paragraph 13) </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">3. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Scrutiny committees are not just involved in scrutinising others but have an active role to play themselves in putting issues on the agenda and acting as a forum for public debate. (Paragraph 14) </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">4. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We believe it continues to be useful to define core tasks for committees, to guide committees in deciding their programme, but not to constrain their freedom to decide their own priorities. (Paragraph 16) </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">5. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Activity of itself is not a measure of effectiveness, and different subject areas require different levels, and different forms, of scrutiny; but the overall high level of committee activity this Parliament is a positive indicator of the commitment made by committees to the tasks they have been set by the House of Commons. (Paragraph 21) </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">6. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We believe that the value of these debates would be greatly enhanced if they were considered on a substantive motion. We note that this is possible under the Standing Orders — substantive motions have recently been used for debates on e-petitions in Westminster Hall — though any division would need to be taken on the floor of the House. Where the committee concerned thinks this is appropriate, and subject to the agreement of the Chairman of Ways and Means, we intend to use this approach in future. (Paragraph 48) </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">7. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We will continue to give priority for Estimates Day debates to committee reports which focus on departmental expenditure and performance. (Paragraph 51) </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">8. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The consensus of those who gave us evidence is that committees are successful in influencing Government. (Paragraph 61) </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">9. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">While we welcome the wide consensus that select committees have a significant, positive impact, we take very seriously the critical feedback received. (Paragraph 63) </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">10. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Now, two years into the Parliament, is a very good time for committees to take stock and agree their objectives for the remainder of the Parliament. (Paragraph 64) </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">11. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We agree that committees should be proactive and forward-looking — and devote less effort to raking over the coals of past events unless there are lessons to be learnt and changes to be recommended. (Paragraph 70) </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">12. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">When considering how to make an impact with the media, committees have a wider range of choices than ever before, and this means we need to give more thought to what we really want to achieve and target resources effectively. (Paragraph 85) </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">13. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">While committees need to maintain their freedom to respond to their particular circumstances, we believe there is a case for setting some principles of good practice. It is our intention to prepare a set of guidelines for this purpose. (Paragraph 104) </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">14. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">If a government response is inadequate, a committee can and should draw attention to this when it reports and publishes the response. (Paragraph 108) </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">15. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We stand ready to work with the Cabinet Office on new guidelines for departments on producing government responses to reports. (Paragraph 109) </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">16. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We do not accept that the Osmotherly rules should have any bearing on whom a select committee should choose to summon as a witness. The Osmotherly rules are merely internal for Government. They have never been accepted by Parliament. Where the inquiry relates to departmental delivery rather than ministerial decision-making, it is vital that committees should be able to question the responsible official directly — even if they have moved on to another job. It does of course remain the case that an official can decline to answer for matters of policy, on the basis that it is for the minister to answer for the policy, but officials owe a direct obligation to Parliament to report on matters of fact and implementation. This does not alter the doctrine of ministerial accountability in any way. Ministers should never require an official to withhold information from a select committee. It cannot be a breach of the principle of ministerial responsibility for an official to give a truthful answer to a select committee question. No official should seek to protect his or her minister by refusing to do so. (Paragraph 113) </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">17. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The way ministerial accountability operates has on occasion been unacceptable, with ministers blaming officials for failures in their departments or in agencies for which they are responsible, but also with officials then refusing to answer questions which would indicate where responsibility for failure actually lies. (Paragraph 114) </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">18. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Additional work arising from such additional committees as the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards could have the effect of reducing availability for existing committees. We do not regard this as acceptable. Any substantial extra committee work, beyond the normal work of existing committees including joint committees, which is </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">undertaken at the initiative of Government should be fully funded by a transfer from the Treasury to the House of Commons. (Paragraph 121) </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">19. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Now may not be the best time to argue for increased resources, but it should be the long term goal of the House to build up the capacity of select committees, to improve their effectiveness and status, to increase their powers and influence, and to improve their efficiency by providing chairs and staffs with accommodation and infrastructure to enable them to hold Government to account. (Paragraph 128) </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">20. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We are persuaded that the disadvantages of enshrining parliamentary privilege in statute would outweigh the benefits. (Paragraph 133) </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">21. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We conclude that, at the very least Parliament should set out a clear, and realistic, statement of its powers — and perhaps also its responsibilities — in a resolution of the House and set out in more detail in Standing Orders how those powers are to be exercised. (Paragraph 134) </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Recommendations</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">For Committees</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">22. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Our Committee has asked the Procedure Committee to consider whether members wishing to leave a committee could be counted as discharged, even if it means that the lack of an applicant leaves a vacancy on the committee. We reiterate the concern we expressed in the last Parliament about the size of select committees and support the Wright Committee's recommendation that the size of departmental committees should not normally be more than 11 members.

A clear indication of which recommendations are most important will help the committee achieve impact and make follow-up easier.

(Paragraph 83) </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">35. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">It is sensible for departmental select committees to be able to cross departmental boundaries when this is in the interest of effective scrutiny of matters which go beyond a single department, but they should do so in ways which respect the role of other departmental select committees and in full consultation with the chairs of those committees. (Paragraph 84) </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">36. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We recommend that the introductory briefings offered to new committee members be given more formality, and include a meeting with the chair or another experienced committee member. When there is significant turnover following a reshuffle, for example, a programme of collective briefings for new committee members should be arranged. (Paragraph 96) </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">37. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We recommend that committees consider the benefits of using professional trainers to help them refresh and develop their questioning skills. (Paragraph 97) </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">38. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We recommend that chairs discuss with their committee how they see their role, and seek their endorsement for it. At this stage in the Parliament, there may be benefit in chairs asking their committees for individual feedback on their chairmanship, as an aid to the chair's professional development and to encourage committee engagement. (Paragraph 100) </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">For the House</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">39. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The timing rule should be relaxed to provide that a statement on a select committee report should be within a reasonable period of the publication of the report: say, within 10 sitting days (so that reports launched when the House is not sitting are not precluded). Finally, we recommend that it should be for the Speaker, in consultation with the Chair of the Liaison Committee, to decide whether a select committee report is sufficiently topical and significant to merit a statement on the floor of the House on any sitting day. It would remain the responsibility of the Backbench Business Committee to decide what select committee reports merit debate in backbench time. (Paragraph 50) </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">40. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We recommend that the funding of the Committee Office Media and Communications team be increased to allow the employment of one or two additional media officers. (Paragraph 120) </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">41. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We recommend that committee clerks, and in some cases other key staff, should normally remain in post for at least four years. (Paragraph 122) </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">42. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We recommend that, if a committee wishes this and the Liaison Committee agrees, it should be possible to recruit a committee clerk directly to post by open competition, and that there should be greater flexibility in bringing in outside experts to support committees in their work. (Paragraph 125) </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">For Government</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">43. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We recommend that the Government engage with us in a review of the relationship between Government and select committees with the aim of producing joint guidelines for </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">departments and committees, which recognise ministerial accountability, the proper role of the Civil Service and the legitimate wish of Parliament for more effective accountability.
