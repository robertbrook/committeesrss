If that option were adopted the government would inevitably be vulnerable to further claims, including the many cases that are currently stayed by the ECtHR, and compensation would </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">be likely to </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">be awarded. However, the ECtHR has made clear in its judgment in Scoppola v Italy (No.3) [2012] ECHR 868 (Scoppola), accepting the United Kingdom Government’s argument, that each state has a wide discretion as to how to regulate any ban so long as it does not constitute blanket disqualification. The Commission’s legal opinion is therefore that either options (a) or (b) in the draft Bill would now constitute effective implementation of the Hirst and Greens judgments. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">If the government fails to implement those judgments at all, this would, on the Commission’s analysis of the case law, leave the United Kingdom open to claims before the ECtHR, and to further protracted litigation. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; page-break-after:avoid; page-break-inside:avoid"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt; font-weight:bold">The three options in the draft Bill</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">a.

Legal commentators have expressed differing </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">opinions. On the Commission’s legal analysis, following the Grand Chamber decision in Scoppola, there is now a much greater chance that the ECtHR would accept disenfranchisement of prisoners serving more than a 6 month sentence as a reasonable way of implementing the earlier Hirst decision, if legislation were brought in to that effect following </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">extensive</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> Parliamentary debate. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The Grand Chamber in Scoppola summarised the findings in Hirst that: </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">“the legislation of the United Kingdom depriving all convicted prisoners serving sentences of the right to vote (section 3 of the 1983 Act) was “a blunt instrument [which stripped] of their Convention right to vote a significant category of persons and it [did] so in a way which [was] indiscriminate”. It found that the provision “impose[d] a blanket restriction on all convicted prisoners in prison. It applie[d] automatically to such prisoners, irrespective of the length of their sentence and irrespective of the nature or gravity of their offence and their individual circumstances.” It concluded that “such a general, automatic and indiscriminate restriction on a vitally important Convention right must be seen as falling outside any acceptable margin of appreciation, however wide that margin might be, and as being incompatible with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1”</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">[86]</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">It went on expressly to reaffirm those principles [96] “</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">in particular the fact that when disenfranchisement affects a group of people generally, automatically and indiscriminately, based solely on the fact that they are serving a prison sentence</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; text-decoration:underline">, irrespective of the length of the sentence and irrespective of the nature or gravity of their offence and their individual circumstances</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">, it is not compatible with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">”</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The Commission’s analysis of that finding is that any restatement of the existing ban would not rectify the breach identified in Hirst.

The House of Commons vote on 20 February 2011 which reaffirmed the legislature’s preference for retaining the existing ban (by voting by 234 to 22 against narrowing the scope of section 3 of the Representation of the People Act 1983) was taken before the hearing in Scoppola. The court was aware of that vote and declined to say that in those circumstances a restatement of the existing ban would be acceptable. In the Commission’s legal opinion, the law is very clear that if option (c) of the draft Bill were adopted the breach in Hirst would not be rectified and the court would find against the government on its next reconsideration of the issue.

Any serious violation of this may lead to a state being asked to withdraw or being removed from membership of the Council (Article 8) (membership of which is a condition of membership of the European Union).  However, on the Commission’s analysis this is would be extremely unlikely in practice. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The United Kingdom generally has a good record and reputation when it comes to implementation of judgments against it which it relies on when encouraging foreign states to respect human rights and abide by the rule of law.

Where, as in the case of prisoners’ voting rights, contracting states had “</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">adopted a number of different ways of addressing the question</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">”, the Court would leave it “</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">to the legislature to decide on the choice of means</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">” [Hirst 83-84]. Following this, in its decision in Greens, the Court again stated that there are “</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">numerous ways of organising and running electoral systems and a wealth of differences</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">”. The Court’s role in this area was said to be “</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">a subsidiary one</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">” with domestic policymakers’ views given “</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">special weight</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">” [113].</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The issue of quite how much weight was directly considered in Hirst. It appears to have been on this point that the lack of a “</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">substantive debate</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">” among MPs on the continued justification of the measure, and purported failure of parliament or the courts “</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">to weigh the competing interests or to assess the proportionality of a blanket ban on the right of a convicted prisoner to vote</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">” was taken into account.

As we have stated above, it is the Commission’s legal opinion that a system based on automatic disqualification based on sentence length would be likely to comply with the Convention, even where no element of judicial determination in the individual case were involved. However, for instance, a system where all prisoners remained disenfranchised except where expressly enfranchised by the sentencing judge, for instance, would not do so. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">c) seeking to comply by enfranchising the minimum number of prisoners possible consistent with our international legal obligations?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">So long as the system adopted is indeed consistent with the state’s international legal obligations there would be no legal consequences in international or domestic law. That is self-evident from the criteria. The only question is where the threshold for minimum number of prisoner so as to ensure compliance would lie. Given the history of the matter it is quite likely that any system that does not </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; text-decoration:underline">clearly</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> comply with Hirst, and therefore with international legal obligations, will be challenged through the domestic courts and in the ECtHR. The volume, cost and length of such litigation will be greater the more borderline any new system is considered to be.
