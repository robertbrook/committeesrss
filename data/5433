</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Similarly HMRC contend that an individual may be a salaried member if he is remunerated by reference to the performance of part of a business rather than all of it (for example, i</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">n a multi-office firm, if they get a share of their office's profits rather than the profits of the entire firm).  This cannot be right: if such an individual is not "really" a partner in the entire firm, then surely their position is far more akin to that</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> of a partner in a smaller firm than that of an employee?</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">  On the flipside, especially in the context of overseas firms with UK offices, members of UK LLPs are often remunerated by reference to the profits of both the UK LLP and an overseas LLP.  HMRC are </span><span style="font-family:Calibri;

</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Our view is that the legislation should not apply to any individual whose arrangem</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">ents are such that what they get is a slice of the firm's total profits.  It should not matter whether that slice is fixed or variable or, if variable, the basis of any variation.  It also should not matter if some members' call on profits is senior to tha</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">t of others.  The defining feature of salaried member status should be whether an individual gets paid anyway even if profits are insufficient.  An employee of a business has a contractual right to be paid.  If the business has insufficient cash to do this</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> it must raise that cash somehow or declare </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">itself</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> insolvent.  An equity holder of a business knows that they only get paid if profits are sufficient, and has no right to claim payment if they are not.  This is the economic distinction between an employee </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">and a partner.  Put in those terms it is easily drawn.  The much more extensive terms of Condition A, as interpreted by HMRC, will catch many individuals who are in fact clearly equity holders in economic terms and not employees.  The draft legislation doe</span><span style="font-family:Calibri;

</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">It follows from our reasoning above that we would accept that where a member of an LLP is entitled to a minimum (or fixed) guaranteed payment, such that other members will fund the payment in the event profits are insuf</span><span style="font-family:Calibri;
