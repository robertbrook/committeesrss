font-size:12pt"> Welcome to this annual scrutiny session of the work of the Charity Commission, somewhat delayed by various circumstances, but that allows us to catch up on a lot of issues that were not resolved, which have now reached a conclusion of one sort or another.  Could I ask each of you to identify yourselves for the record, please?   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-weight:bold">Q2 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> As I always say, it is very helpful if you keep your answers crisp and short.  I will pull you up, unfortunately, if they are getting a bit rambling, and the same goes for the questions that we ask.  Our Twitter tag is #charitycommission if anybody wants to follow on Twitter.  There has been very widespread discussion about the inability of the Charity Commission to regulate the sector effectively.  For example, David Walker described the Charity Commission as a regulator that does not regulate.  How fair do you think this criticism is?   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">William Shawcross</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I do not think it is fair.  We regulate effectively.  The overwhelming majority of the 160,000 charities in this country are wonderful, law-abiding, small—as it happens—organisations.  The majority have incomes of less than £20,000 a year.  They do not need much regulation.  There are only a few charities that step out of line, and we are determined to regulate them as effectively as we can.  We have stepped up the number of inquiries that we have and the pace has changed considerably.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sam Younger</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We did acknowledge, in particular with the National Audit Office Report, that there was much we need to do to improve our performance at the toughest end of the regulatory spectrum.  That is what the NAO Report focused on.  We are aware that we need to do better there and we already are.  I will tell you a bit more about that in a moment.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The National Audit Office Report, and I would suggest also the comments that have been made by others who have picked up on that, looked at a very narrow element of what the Commission does.  We do a huge amount of consents, of working with trustees when they get things wrong, rather than moving to use of powers and formal inquiries, in the provision of generic guidance and the public register.  If you look across the totality, the Commission regulates well within the context of very limited resources.  However, we know, in those key areas the NAO looked at, we can and must do a lot better.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q3 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> In your evidence to the Public Accounts Committee, you said that the Commission had been weakest in “identifying deliberate wrongdoing and escalating that effectively into action”.  Why has that been so?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sam Younger</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There are a number of things, Chair, that have happened.  If you go back a little way and you look at the period after the passage of the 2006 Act, there was a very strong emphasis in what the Commission was being asked to do on the enabling, working with trustees and improving charities element, rather than on the regulation.  I was also quite struck—this was before I came to this post—that there was a Hampton report under BIS on the Charity Commission, which said that the Charity Commission was regulating proportionately, and needed to focus in future on public benefit, improving guidance and helping charities to be more effective.  There was a sense there that the role was an enabling one, and that has begun to turn around.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Secondly, there has been, and it is part of the same thing, a sense that these are volunteers running charities—nearly a million of them across the piece—and that the Commission’s approach ought to be to work with trustees as far as possible if things go wrong, in order to put them right again.  As the Chairman said, there are only a small minority of cases where it is appropriate to move to powers.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The third element was that in the early days of the Charity Tribunal there was one particular decision—where the Charity Commission had removed a trustee—where the Tribunal said, “You should not have removed the trustee.  You should have engaged more with the trustees and worked with them.”  That had a bit of a chilling effect.  We have recognised that all needs to be turned around and that we need to be ready to cut trustees less slack when we do identify potentially serious wrongdoing.  We are beginning to do that now, but there is still further to go.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal;

font-size:12pt"> We are going to the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Cup Trust</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> later, but, Mr Shawcross, why do you think that you have to admit that this has been your weakest function when, in fact, most people think it is your most important function?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">William Shawcross</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I did not admit that it has been our weakest function; I said that we had stepped it up.  I do not want to bore you with statistics, but in the six months from April 2013, we opened 26 statutory inquiries.  In the previous year, we had opened 15 inquiries, so you can see that in the last 12 to 14 months we have stepped up our engagement quite considerably.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal;

font-size:12pt"> It sounds like needles in haystacks; how many charities are under your jurisdiction?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">William Shawcross</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: 160,000.  I hope it will always be needles in haystacks, because I hope there are not masses of pitchforks hidden in these haystacks; I do not believe there are.  I think the overwhelming majority of charities are well run, as Sam said, by volunteer trustees.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q6 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The consensus appears to be that, as David Walker put it, the Commission never really recovered from Labour’s 2006 legislation, which is what piled all these other duties on the Charity Commission.  Do you agree with that?   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">William Shawcross</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The 2006 Act was a huge watershed, and in particular in the definition and requirements of charities displaying public benefit.  After the 2006 Act—which was long before I arrived; I have only been here 14 months—a lot of our resources were taken up with defining and writing guidance on public benefit.  There are fewer resources used for that now, partly because we have fewer resources and partly because that guidance on public benefit has been established.  But certainly the 2006 Act was a very important moment and a difficult moment for us.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal;

font-size:12pt"> All these things you have to do: accountability, effective use of charitable resources and ensuring that charities use their resources effectively—how are you meant to do that?  Is this not an unfair burden on you?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sam Younger</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is a very wide remit, and it is fair to say that there is an increasing disjunction between the breadth of the remit and the resources available to do it, but if I look at the totality of what the Commission does, there is a unity to it.  We have already in the past three or four years, since the 2010 spending review and a 33% cut, which we then needed to adjust to, focused on what I think are the five core elements of what we need to do.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal;

font-size:12pt"> What are the duties you think you should dispense with or be allowed to dispense with?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sam Younger</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The key duty that we effectively have dispensed with, which was very strongly a part of what the Commission did in the period after the 2006 Act, is providing advice to charities.  We were seen as, and regarded ourselves as, a hand holder or a helpmeet to charities.  They came to us a lot of the time and we would give them a lot of one-to-one advice.  We stripped that right out.  Our advice to charities is now generic guidance that is available on the web, which has to be there.  Indeed our contact centre’s main role is directing people towards the web.  However, we still need to undertake that core guidance, but we cannot move out of registration.  Registration is essential.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal;

font-size:12pt"> Mr Shawcross, are there other duties that you think should be lifted from the Charity Commission?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">William Shawcross</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I do not think so.  As Sam said, the guidance was a very big burden after 2006 because there was a brand new Act and a lot to explain and understand.  That burden has diminished considerably now and the duties we carry out are our core duties, which is to be the regulator.  Sam is also right that eight years ago the Charity Commission was seen much more as a supportive organisation for charities.  I do not think that is our role.  Our </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">role is to be the regulator and regulate, regulate, regulate.  That is what we are trying to do more effectively all the time.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q10 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> There is now a consultation that suggests you should have extra powers, extending the range of criminal offences that automatically bar a person from acting as a charity trustee, a new discretionary power for the Charity Commission to disqualify a person who is unfit, a new statutory warning power, an extension of several existing powers and technical changes to close loopholes.  Are you happy with this?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">William Shawcross</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes, it would help us enormously.  For example, it seems to me quite absurd that the only basis on which we can disqualify a trustee now is for the crime of fraud.  If he has committed a terrorist offence, he is not automatically disqualified as a trustee.  That seems to me absurd.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sam Younger</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The proposed powers that are in the consultation have effectively come from what we have been pressing for for some time.  We are very glad to see them in that consultation.  We are aware that there will be push back on some of them.  We had a public meeting in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt"> In my constituency, and I am speaking about before and after 2006, I have come across cases where there is cause for concern—allegations of abuse of charity status by trustees—and my experience ties in very much with the comments made by the National Audit Office.  I would agree that you were slow to act, not tough enough and there was insufficient follow-up.  Mr Younger, you have agreed you need to up your game considerably on this.  All this came to a head around The Cup Trust case, did it not?  The Charity Tribunal were very critical of the way you handled that.  The National Audit Office said, among other things, that you were too passive and, again, Mr Younger, you have admitted that you got it wrong in that case.  What if another Cup Trust comes along?  What will you do differently?  What have you learnt from the experience of this case?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">David Heyes:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I would like to hear from both of you, yes.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">William Shawcross</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Cup Trust was registered before I came to the Commission.  Even the NAO said that we had to register the Cup Trust at the time but we should have asked more questions about the trustees.  I completely accept that; that is true.  The biggest mistake we made in the Cup Trust saga was to close down the investigation in 2012, while HMRC were still continuing their investigation.  We should not have done that.  I have said that before.  </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The Commission has said that before.  Now, it is an inquiry before the Tribunal, and that is the proper place for it to be.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sam Younger</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: In terms of whether we can be confident that there would not be other Cup Trusts in the future, one could never say 100% anyway, but we have certainly tightened up considerably our practices in registration and the range of things that raise red flags and lead us to ask further questions.  As the Chair says, that does not necessarily mean you will not be forced to register a charity, but we have tightened that up.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We have also developed a new system for monitoring, which is if we are in the position where we do not have any alternative but to register a charity but we still have some doubts, not about the charitable purposes but about how they might be carried out in practice, we have an improved system to put them into formal monitoring so that we can keep an eye on what is going on.  We are also working much more closely with HMRC in this area.  We have a new memorandum of understanding.  There is much more information exchange with HMRC.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">William Shawcross</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: No; that is why we have asked for new powers.  We have not been able to go as far as we want.  As Sam mentioned, there was one case of removing a trustee that was turned over in the Tribunal, which had a very debilitating or dampening effect on our ability to do that.  I hope if the new powers are agreed that case would not happen again.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We are using our powers. As I mentioned before, we have had many more statutory inquiries in the last year and we have used our powers in the last six months 350 times, as opposed to 215 times in the year before I came.  We really are stepping up.  The NAO Report was very useful to us.  It is only a partial survey of what we do, but in that part that it did survey, we accept its recommendations and we are stepping up to the plate.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-weight:bold">William Shawcross</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Because HMRC does the principal responsibility for tax; it is not our principal responsibility.  However, as Sam says, we are liaising with HMRC much more closely now, and as I also said to you earlier, I think we were wrong to close down our investigation in 2012 when HMRC continued theirs.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sam Younger</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There was a degree of—if you want to put it this way—risk aversion.  That was partly driven by some of the early decisions of the Tribunal.  It was also driven by the fact that the Commission as a regulator under charity law is complex.  It is something we have been moving to turn around, but these things that are cultural and attitudinal do not change overnight.  We have been in a process of turning that round over recent years.  Some of the evidence that it has changed is there in the statistics we have had recently and an internal audit report from our internal auditors—from BIS.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">William Shawcross</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I am trying to answer it from the particular to the general.  That kind of particular instance would lead to generalised concerns: is this kosher?  Is it proper?  We would now ask many more questions than were asked when the charity was registered.  But I return to the fact that even the NAO said we had a duty to register it, because its purposes appeared to be completely charitable.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sam Younger</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: One of the things that has been there for all sorts of reasons is that the Commission has focused its regulatory work on what the risks were—and risks in legal terms of taking action—and insufficiently focused on the wider public policy risks of not taking action.  That is the balance that we have to change.  That is the message that has been going out to our staff through our board and through our senior staff now over the last 18 months.  I was very pleased that in the BIS internal audit done recently they said they found no evidence that the Commission was now reluctant to use the powers it has.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt"> When you were asked whether you had a figure for the amount of money the Commission would need to carry out its required functions, Mr Younger, you said, “No I do not have the figure; I have other things to do.”  Have you a figure now?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sam Younger</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I do not have a figure right now, because a committee is being set up to prepare the Commission for the case it needs to make to an incoming government about future funding; it is being constructed now.  The point I was making there was that the focus of my work in the last three and a half years has been to structure the Commission in a way that allows us to cope with what we need to do within the increasingly limited figures that Parliament has voted us.  Therefore, spending resources in that period on constructing what we would like to have as resources has not been something that we have found very worthwhile to do.  The Chair is now working with others to construct that very sense of what the Commission needs to do the job properly.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">William Shawcross</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We are down roughly from £30 million six years ago to £20 million and falling now.  If it is still falling with the latest spending review, I will have to spend a lot of time this year going to the Treasury and to ministers to argue for more funds, because the salami slicing that happens is very damaging.  I do not want to whinge about this.  I know all departments are subject to cuts and I totally understand that.  To answer your question, if we had another 10% on what we have now—that is to say another £2 million—that would be extremely helpful and we would not have to cut back as much as we may have to.  Using our resources and investigative powers more intensely is very expensive.  We will be spending more time in the Tribunal doing reviews, etc.  We want to be a tougher regulator but it does not come cheap.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">William Shawcross</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It would be absurd for me to say, “Please restore the status quo to £30 million.”  I have already said, and I will repeat, if we could have a 10% increase rather than a 10% cut, which is envisaged, that would be wonderfully helpful.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sam Younger</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: One of the reasons the equation is not one of saying that we should go back to what there was before, but of something much more modest is that—and this is very much a tribute to the staff of the Commission—there have been remarkably successful initiatives, through automation of transactional processes, the improvement in the web and partnerships </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">with umbrella organisations, to reduce incoming demand for the Commission’s services very significantly.  That has opened up quite a lot of possibility.  It makes it very difficult to invest in anything new, given that that absorbs what you need to cut.  However, it means we would not say that we want a restoration of the status quo ante; I would say it is probably more in the realm of, as the Chair says, an increase of 10% on our current position.  That would enable us to breathe a bit and cope with the real pressures that there are; something more than that would enable us to do a great deal more.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">However, when you are dealing with 165,000 charities, there is an element of: “How long is a piece of string?”  We will never in any realistic funding environment be able to do everything we would like to do in terms of those 165,000 charities.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">William Shawcross</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is awfully hard to know.  Eliza Manningham-Buller was asked a year or two years ago, when she was still at M15, “How many investigations into terrorist plots do you have at the moment?”  She said, “</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">34.”</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">  She was asked, “Why 34?”  She said, “Because that is all I have resources for.”  So, as Sam says, it is: how long is a piece of string?  I am not here to say that we have got to have fantastic amounts of money.  I am realistic about the cuts that all government departments are facing.  But I must spend the next few months arguing that there will come a point where, if the Charity Commission is just cut and cut and cut down to £15 million or something, we would not be able to do the job that you rightly expect of us.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sam Younger</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is fair enough to say that there is a link between resources and how many investigations there are—not necessarily the top-end inquiries, but the broader ones on compliance.  In our Operations area, in 2012-13, we opened about 1,500 compliance cases.  In relation to our risk framework, I would not say we are often turning down engagement in issues because we do not have the resources.  It is taking a tough view against our risk framework, and if you go back a few years, it is fair to say that the Commission—or at least this is what I found when I came in—was being drawn into more things at a lower level than it really needed to be.  I am not sure it is so much a question of saying that the resources are what drive how many investigations you do.  It is the clarity and consistency with which we operate a risk framework.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

it cannot be now because of the opportunity of the end of leases, which were entered into many, many years ago, which fall in 2015 and 2016. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt"> Before I ask that, having listened to what you are saying, I wondered whether the registration process itself is too automatic and do you need to change that?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sam Younger</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is a very interesting question.  The registration process is not automatic.  There is a human eye that looks across every single application for registration. I think, at the last count, this year, we receive 27 new applications for registration every single working day of the year.  In terms of our resources, we need to get better at how we identify which ones carry risk that we need to look at more carefully, and which are the ones that are essentially very low risk and we can process much more readily.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Currently, when our registration applications come in they are labelled green risk or red risk, which are very easy to run with.  Red risk you will do significantly more work on.  Green risk you can get through very quickly, sometimes in 24 hours.  However, there is a significant swathe in amber, and we need to get better at isolating which of those carry real risk in terms of the integrity of charitable status, and which are simply about lack of adequate explanation or detail on what people want to do.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We do need to be very careful that we do not make registration a process that discourages people from setting up charities.  One of the things one should celebrate is that, even though we have had a significant period of recession, there are still 5,000 to 6,000 people and groups of people wanting to set up charities to help people in their communities every single year.  That is a remarkably positive phenomenon.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

they did everything.  They employed very expensive legal and presidential people—people who were in the public relations trade.  I have to give you this background, because this is a very exceptional case.  Is that the advice—that if someone is discovered by you not to be providing public benefit; that was your firm decision, very convincingly—they then go out, engage PR and legal people, and you will climb down because you do not want the financial and other problems of fighting for what was an entirely rational decision?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

we did not challenge the judgment that there was.  We acknowledged that we had to redo the guidance.  We redid it with a great deal of consultation.  What has come out has been well received and is clearer than it was before.  Even if it was not a statutory obligation to produce guidance on public benefit, we would have to provide some guidance.  Indeed, now we are involved in some work that charities and those who promote charities have been asking for for some time: a bit more clarity in terms of how we apply the test in relation to different heads of charity.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt"> A key phrase that was just mentioned—going back to the public benefit test—was that guidance is not law.  Is that not the nub of the problem and the invidious and very difficult situation the Charity Commission has been in?  To quote from our report last year, we as a Committee said, “The Charities Act 2006 has been an administrative and financial disaster for the Charity Commission and for the charities involved, absorbing vast amounts of energy and commitment, as well as money.”  Is the answer not to keep looking to you and blaming you but that this place, Parliament, should legislate?  I know you have views on this, Mr Shawcross, but surely, after the lessons of the very unhappy experiences of recent cases, is the lesson not now for Parliament to define in law what a charity must do to deliver public benefit—to pass a test that we would all agree so we do not have to go through the previous episodes that you have had to go through, and take up a lot of your time and public money?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt;

font-size:12pt">2006 found it impossible to define public benefit.  That is why it was left to us and, in effect, to the court and the Tribunal that was set up in the 2006 Act; in other words, to the development of common law.  That is how British law has always worked and worked wonderfully well over centuries.  This will settle down; as more charity law cases go to the Tribunal, a legal consensus will emerge.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">As to your question about whether it is the responsibility of Parliament, of course that is true.  Parliament wrote the 2006 Act and passed it into law, and it is up to Parliament to change it if it wishes.  Obviously, the guidance is a burden on us that we could have done without, but it is our statutory obligation at the moment and we will carry it out so long as that is the case.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

in fact, many charities have it as a key part of their purposes to campaign for those purposes.  In the case of Shelter, it is campaigning on homelessness.  No charity is allowed to campaign for a political party or for political interest.  I know you understand that very well, Mr Halfon.  Political campaigning is always going to be a neuralgic issue and I am conscious that it is still today.  It is something we are always looking at in terms of whether we should change our guidance, but at the moment we have not done so.  We might look at it again.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

we pay four people over £60,000 and so on.  That is what this system is at the minute.  As Sam said, though, we are consulting with the charities as we are bound to on the recommendations in the PASC report.  We will act upon them as best we can.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;
