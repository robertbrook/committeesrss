This is the newsletter of Community Action Northumberland.</span><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The article is on Page 5, and is about </span><span style="font-family:Calibri;

font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">"In order to subsidise our community work NEED tenders for and has been awarded contracts with a number of partners </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">which include Home to School contracts for Northumberland County Council, Secure Transport Services and Driver Only Services for Northumberland, Tyne &amp; Wear NHS Foundation Trust, and Passenger Transport Services for North East Ambulance Service."</span><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">This seems to confirm to me what I have been suspecting over the last year, that the number of NEED vehicles which I see operating in the locality has increased greatly.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> Whilst I certainly do not want</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">to jeopardise the good work of a community organization which does essential work for the most vulnerable and needy people in our community, I do feel that there might be some risks in this situation.</span><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">If NEED has been tendering for contracts, then it is presumably in competition with other transport businesses</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> The large national and international transport companies are unlikely to be affected, because they seem to concentrate on the high volume main routes, and so </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">I suspect that it is the few remaining local transport companies, both buses and taxis, who NEED is competing with in order to get money to subsidise its community work</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> The viability of these companies is therefore being squeezed between the national companies whose scale allows them to use the most </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">competative</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> pricing on the most lucrative routes, and NEED, who, so far as I understand it, can use volunteer drivers, and has less exacting legal demands to comply with in terms of vehicles and operating procedures.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> I think that there is therefore likely to be a</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold"> real danger of jeopardising the viability of the local transport businesses </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">who together provide a transport network which serves the needs of the whole community and not just very specific sections of it.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> These transport companies also provide much needed employment, and I suspect that they are certainly not profiteering, but are continuing to operate under very difficult conditions in order to provide services in the particular communities where they are based and</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">committed to.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> This applies to taxi services as well as bus services, because it is the taxis who are there to fill in the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">gaps</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">which the buses cannot for those committed bus passengers who can contemplate spending a large amount of money on a taxi when necessary.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> Taxi services have also been suffering increasingly difficult trading conditions during the recession, because fewer and fewer people can afford to go out at all, let alone use a taxi.</span><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Local bus companies in this area which I know of include </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Rothbury</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> Motors, now based in </span><span style="font-family:Calibri;

font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">may be so short of funds that they are unable to consider any alternative, but I do think that this might well risk creating further problems</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">for communities in the long term.</span><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><br /><span style="font-family:Calibri;

font-size:11pt">It occurs to me that another partial solution to the problem of funding public transport </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">in rural areas </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">would be to </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">allow pensioners to use their free passes for the whole day</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">, and not just after the rush hour has finished.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> In a rural area, though there may be a significant number of commuters, they are unlikely to fill a whole bus, and so it could probably accommodate early-bird retired passengers as well without any problem. This would allow retired rural passengers more viable connections to the rest of the public transport network, and would alleviate overcrowding of elderly people on the first bus available to them after the rush hour </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">(e.g. the number 14 </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">Thropton</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt"> to </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">Morpeth</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt"> service, recently altered by Arriva and Northumberland County Council because of this problem)</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">It might also mean that some services could be amalgamated so that fewer services needed to be run in the middle of the working day.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> Of course some mid-day services would still be needed to serve those who have to take a lot of medication in the morning, and have to wait for some hours until it has taken effect before they are able to do much.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">October 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
