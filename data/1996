Regulators already work within a number of well recognised frameworks. In particular the Hampton Principles, which have been in place since 2005, were introduced as a result of a report on ‘</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Reducing</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> administrative burdens: effective inspection and enforcement’.</span><a name="_ftnref5"></a><a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">  Regulators’ compliance with these principles has been evaluated by the Better Regulation Executive.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The Hampton principles were developed to reduce unnecessary administration for businesses, without compromising the UK's regulatory regime and they are recognised as the standard with which regulators should comply. They provide that ‘Regulators should recognize that a key element of their activity will be to allow, or even encourage, economic progress and only to intervene when there is a clear case for protection’. We would therefore question why any further provisions are needed. Any case for additional regulation in this area should be based on evidence either that the Hampton Principles are not being applied or that they do not work. We are not aware of any such evidence having been produced to support the new duty being proposed in this draft Bill. We are also not aware of any consultation about this proposal with civil society organisations that have an interest in the work of non-economic regulators. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">If Ministers have evidence that regulators are acting in ways that would impede economic growth without adequate justification, this evidence should be made public so that there can be a considered debate about what a proportionate response to any problems might be. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">We are very concerned that the promoting economic growth duty will compromise the independence of regulators. In the case of the EHRC, it would jeopardise the Commission’s UN accreditation as an A rated national human rights institution. We are also concerned about the position of other non-economic regulators whose remit encompasses equality or human rights, such as the Children’s Commissioners and the Information Commissioner.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">There are a number of factors behind this concern about the compromising of regulators’ independence:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 10.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The phrasing of the growth duty is likely to have a chilling effect on regulators, discouraging them from taking action that would be in the public interest. Clause 58 is framed in terms of regulatory action only being taken when it is ‘needed’ and any action taken being ‘proportionate’. At a common sense level, this sounds unexceptional: we can all agree that regulatory methods should only be used when they are needed and this approach already underpins the Hampton Principles. However, the use of ‘needed’ is of concern because it is a subjective term. Who is to say whether a particular regulatory action is ‘needed’? This judgment should surely be for regulators themselves to make within the existing framework of public law but this duty is likely to make them much more risk-averse and reluctant to use their powers for fear of having to prove on each occasion that action was ‘needed’ rather than a simply appropriate and justified.  </span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 10.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">In addition, clause 60 would give Ministers the power to define economic growth, the ways in which regulators can exercise their functions so as to promote economic growth and how they are to demonstrate compliance with the economic growth duty. It would be possible for Ministers to use this power to prevent regulators making any use at all of some of their current powers on the grounds that, in Ministers’ view, use of these powers would impede economic growth, again as defined by Ministers. This would effectively give Ministers the power to tell regulators how to do their jobs, a clear compromising of their independence. </span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 10.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The draft Bill does not define what regulatory functions would be covered by the economic growth duty but leaves this to Ministers to define by order. Potentially, the functions covered could include any and all forms of guidance or advice, as well as statutory codes of practice, inquiries, investigations, litigation and enforcement action. It </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">would be a substantial intrusion into regulators’ independence if Ministers could define the circumstances in which they could issue guidance. </span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 10.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The Government’s foreword to the draft Bill speaks of ‘bringing the huge resource of over 50 regulators … to bear on the crucial task of promoting economic growth’. If used effectively, the functions and powers of some non-economic regulators are likely to support economic growth. The EHRC could, for example, support economic growth by offering guidance to employers on how they can make best use of all the talent available to them in the labour market, or it could inquire into the most effective ways to support entrepreneurship amongst minority communities who are struggling to access finance. However, promoting economic growth is not the function that Parliament has given to non-economic regulators like the Children’s Commissioners, the Information Commissioner or the EHRC. As the legislation that created these bodies makes clear, their jobs are to protect or promote the rights of particular groups of people, such as children or disabled people, or to protect specific rights, such as data protection. We think it is essential that these regulators – which are all accountable to Parliament either directly or through Ministers – are able to make their own judgments about how to fulfil the important functions that Parliament has given them.  </span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Taken as a whole, clauses 58-61 would give Ministers considerable powers to intervene in how regulators created by Parliament do their jobs, with very limited parliamentary scrutiny of how Ministers would use these new powers. Some of the regulators likely to be affected by these clauses have functions of constitutional significance, such as protecting vulnerable individuals against abuse or intrusive uses of state power. It would be wrong for Ministers to have the power to be able potentially to undermine the role of independent regulators in this way. We therefore think clauses 58-61 should be removed from the draft Bill. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">We note that other Parliaments have addressed this in a more balanced way.
