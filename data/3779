The subjective or relative safety of cyclists is based on the perception of a cyclist</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">. On that basis, I feel far less safe on UK roads than I do on Dutch roads. This perception of relative safety is based on the proximity to fast-moving vehicles, on unclear and dangerous junctions I have to share with large vehicles and the fact that the c</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ycling infrastructure that has</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> been put in place is woeful. As a consequence, I am much more on my guard when I cycle in the UK than when I cycle in the Netherlands and always feel that at any moment I could be hit by a vehicle whose driver has not behaved</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> appropriately around a cyclist on the road or because they have failed to observe basic road </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">safety practices, such as checking their blind spot before turning a corner. Drivers of all vehicles, including cyclists, are generally, in my perception, more im</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">patient, less tolerant of others and their mistakes – especially drivers of cyclists – and less aware of nor willing to take into account the limitations an</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">d abilities of other road users</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">4 What could and should central and local Government do to improve</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold"> cycling safety?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">4.1 Both in the Netherlands and in the UK, road users make mistakes or wilfully ignore traffic rules.

The role of Government should therefore be to seek to limit the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">possibilities for rule-breaking</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">, knowingly or otherwise, and to seek to limit the consequences of </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">rule-breaking, by ensuri</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ng the scope for accidents as a result of rule-breaking are limited.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">4.2 Secondly, the role of Government should be to be to improve overall road safety.

For examp</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">le, HGV turning alarms do not tackle the underlying failure of the road design that sees a vulnerable user and a powerful user share the same space. They merely try to alleviate the symptoms of this situation rather than asking searching questions as to ho</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">w such confrontations between road users with such a huge disparity in mass and speed could be allowed to take place in the first instance. In this context, it is important to note that cycling safety has been improved in the Netherlands in the last few de</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">cades without resorting to such pointless devices as HGV turning alarms.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">4.4.

The Netherlands is a road safety laboratory: many measures have been </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">tried,</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> those that were successful were kept and spread across the country after they proved to be successful but often without central Government mandating specific measure</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">s over others.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> This fits with the highly devolved structure of government in the Netherlands, where provincial and municipal authorities have much flexibility in how they achieve commons goals.

A densely populated country, space is limited and Dutch roads are not exempt from the need for a compact built environment.
