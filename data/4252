one is a fixed proportion of the impulse (A0) and the remainder is time dependent.  The time dependent part has several terms but it is only the long duration ones that are relevant.  A0 has a value of about 0.22 which means that proportion of the impulse – by definition CO2 emissions – stays in the atmosphere for eternity.  But because nature cannot distinguish between the emissions, natural surges will also be accumulated in the atmosphere.  It means that any input to the atmosphere will cause a ratcheting-up of the concentration.  The time dependent part in contrast allows for accumulation within the decay constant (lifetime), but also gradual decay towards the pre-impulse level.  It is very difficult to give A0 any credibility.</span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman';
