Another failure of cy</span><span style="font-family:Corbel; font-size:11pt">cl</span><span style="font-family:Corbel; font-size:11pt">e lanes occurs regularly in Dutch cities, where cycle lanes regularly take right-angled turns (or even doglegs) in order that the cycle lane crosses a larger road </span><span style="font-family:Corbel; font-size:11pt">at an appropriate point.

Tipper trucks are of a different design. Their higher torque is visible.

All of these design factors, however, should make the vehicle in itself safer</span><span style="font-family:Corbel; font-size:11pt">, since it provides more control to the driver. The reason for the opposite result is obvious - the drivers.
