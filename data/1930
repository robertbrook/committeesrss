There are approximately 14,000 adviser firms employing 81,000 staff. 40% of investment and protection products are sold through financial advisers, with annual revenue estimated at £3.8 billion (£2.2 billion from investment business, £1.2 billion from general insurance and £400 million from mortgages). Over 50% of the population rank financial advisers as one of their top three most trusted sources of advice about money matters. As such, financial advisers represent a leading force in the maintenance of a competitive and dynamic retail financial services market.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">APFA welcomes this opportunity to respond to the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills’ consultation on Non-economic Regulators: Duty to have regard to growth.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">OUR RESPONSE</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">In general we would welcome the introduction of a duty for regulators to have regard to growth. The financial services sector, in which we have a particular interest, is integral to the prosperity of the wider economy,</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">employing 1.1 million people and contributing 9% of UK GDP. It is therefore imperative that the financial services regulators should not act in a disproportionate way which might constrain financial services firms from growing. We understand, from correspondence with the Department</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills, that it is not currently the government’s intention to include the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) within the scope of a duty to have regard to growth. We believe this is a missed opportunity. Given the importance of the financial services sector to the UK economy, omitting the FCA from a duty to have regard to growth means the proposed legislation risks not having as much impact as would otherwise be the case.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The previous regulator, the FSA, did not have a duty to consider the economic impact of its actions and we believe this led to it developing policies in isolation without considering the overall impact regulation was having on the industry or the economy. An example is the Retail Distribution Review (RDR). Data recently published by APFA</span><a name="_ftnref1"></a><a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> suggests that preparing for RDR caused a drop in revenue for financial advice firms in 2012, following several years of steady growth. Whilst it is too early to know what impact it will have in 2013, figures recently published by the FSA show that there has been a 25% fall in the number of advisers operating in the market, which suggests that there may be an on-going negative impact on firms’ revenue. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">We acknowledge that the Financial Services Act 2012 (FSA 2012) includes a regulatory principle that the FCA must have regard to the desirability of sustainable growth. Our concern is that the current consultation envisages a stronger duty (i.e. regulators </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">must</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> consider the impact of their actions in economic terms) than that which is contained in the FSA 2012. If the FCA were to be excluded from the duty</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">proposed in this consultation, it will not be </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">obliged</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> to consider the economic impact of its actions, but only </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">to have regard to the desirability</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> of economic growth.

It seems to us, and it appears to be the intention expressed in the paper (at paragraph 2.15) that if the FCA is within the scope of the Regulators’ Compliance Code (and we believe it should be) then it must by extension come within the scope of a legal duty to consider the impact of its actions in economic terms. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Given the legislation is intended to apply to all non-economic regulators, there needs to be a strong argument for deciding to omit any particular regulator. We do not believe that argument can be made in respect of the FCA. We therefore believe that primary legislation should be used to introduce a duty for regulators to have regard to growth and the economic impact of their actions, and that the FCA should be brought within the scope of that legislation, as well as within the scope of the Regulators’ Compliance Code.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">APFA</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">18</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:7.33pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold; vertical-align:super">th</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold"> April 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:center"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">2</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div><hr style="width:33%; height:1px; text-align:left" /><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn1"></a><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt"> See the APFA website:  </span><a href="http://www.apfa.net/policy/financial-adviser-market/"><span style="color:#0000ff; font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; text-decoration:underline">www.apfa.net/policy/financial-adviser-market/</span></a></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p></body></html>
