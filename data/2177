In South Africa a taxi driver has been convicted of multiple counts of homicide for his reckless behavio</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">ur that led to the death of children travelling to school. In the United Kingdom, Victorian railway legislation provides for a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for wilfully endangering safety on the railway. Going forward, it is important that there i</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">s a willingness to prosecute the most serious cases of wilful misuse with the same sanctions applying to the most serious cases of causing death by dangerous driving available in the wider highway arena.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt; text-decoration:underline">Evaluation</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="18" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">Evaluating the efficacy of the arrangem</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">ents to reduce risk SFAIRP at level crossings is not something that should only be applied to railway infrastructure providers.

As such there </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">will be occasions where it elects to invest in level crossing schemes over and above those where action is necessary to reduce risk SFAIRP. It is important that this is recognised. However, equally, this must not be the “get out” used by other parties play</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">ing a greater role in managing risk arising at level crossings. This is particularly the case when funding of grade separation schemes that cannot be justified on railway safety grounds alone are concerned. As the low-hanging fruit of the current Network R</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">ail closure programme are achieved the average cost of further level crossing elimination will surely rise. Equable funding protocols are needed to ensure that those benefit from level crossing elimination contribute appropriately.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt; text-decoration:underline">Railways other than Net</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt; text-decoration:underline">work Rail and Translink</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="20" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:11pt"> This evidence has so far focused on the level crossings of Network Rail’s rights of way and by extension those of Translink in Northern Ireland.
