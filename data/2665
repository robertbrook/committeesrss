A recent example of this involved a registrant that had been subject to a five year NMC investigation with 20,000 pages of documents, and the registrant was told that 28 days would be adequate to prepare a response.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">10.19 </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">The NMC publishes detailed information on its website about the outcome of interim order hearings.
