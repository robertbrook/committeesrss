This is a personal account of my reasons, as a woman, for currently having left a STEM career in academia. I do not believe them to be unique, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">quite the contrary. I give some background information for context, and then point out some problems in paragraph 4: problems that most women in my situation face. Issues I feel the government should be addressing are given in paragraph 7.  Women need far </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">more opportunities to work part time, peculiarly when applying for new jobs to return to the workplace.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">2. I did a PhD in physics and continued on to do a postdoctoral research position in mathematical engineering. I love maths, science and research, and </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">was sure that nothing would make me leave. I had never felt discriminated against in any way, or that I had any different opportunities to my male peers.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">3. Then I decided to have children. I was advised to wait until I had a permanent position, preferabl</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">y until I had reached senior lecturer. I was not prepared to wait until I was significantly older and risks of complications had increased significantly.  As I was on a short-term contract, (which is the case for most STEM researchers in academia under the</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> age of 35) I was unable to return to my previous position after my maternity leave, and was also unable to benefit from contractual maternity pay. I was also advised to apply for a new position to extend my contract without telling anyone that I was pregn</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">ant until after being offered a position. I could not do this. I know the law does not allow discrimination against pregnant women, but this is easy to get round in practice, especially in academia where projects and backgrounds are so different.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">3. The p</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">rospect of applying for a new position while looking after a baby and looking for part-time work was too daunting, and seemed too unlikely to succeed to even attempt. There are very few part-time positions available for new applicants. It may be possible t</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">o reduce a full-time post to part time, but to find a position which will take you part time from the start seems very rare.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">4. I therefore had a short gap before my next baby, hoping that I could get back to work more quickly that way. My second is now 1</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">5 months, and I'm trying to find jobs to apply for, but the task is very daunting due to several factors:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The availability of part-time work is dismal.</span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Even if I manage to get a few part-time postdoctoral research positions, where will this lead me?

Is it even worth trying? Completing such an appli</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">cation would put significant pressure on the entire family, and the chances of success are low.  </span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">5. I expect I will manage to return to a STEM career, but I expect it will be at a much lower level than I planned before having children. Perhaps doing some</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">thing like tutoring, and keeping a little research going in my spare time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">6. For comparison, my husband did his physics PhD at the same time as me, but finished slightly later and started his first postdoctoral research position 8 months later than me. H</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">is prospects for a successful career in academia are looking very promising, whereas mine now seem almost non-existent, due to having children and not wanting to return to work straight away, full time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">7. The biggest problem seems to me to be a lack of p</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">art time positions for new applicants and help to return to work, and the extreme difficulty of following a career path successfully part time. Ideally I should be able to return to work at 50% and be able to reach the same goals in twice as long. This, ho</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">wever, seems very far from reality. Could the government provide some incentives for hiring parents part-time after career breaks? The system is completely set up for full-time jobs. Researchers apply to research councils for funding in full-time positions</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, and if they hire someone part time they risk losing some of their hard earned funding if they cannot find someone else part-time for the rest of the funding. Could research councils encourage funding applications with part-time jobs, or automatically ext</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">end the length of the funding proportionally if a person is hired part time?  Without something like that, women wishing to return part time are not competitive on the job market. Anti-discrimination laws seem of little use in practice. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">August 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
