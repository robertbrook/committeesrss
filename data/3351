However, increased use of antibiotics and other agents that co-select for antibiotic resistance (AR) (e.g. biocides, heavy metals, environmental pollutants) has eroded the efficacy of many antibiotic classes to a point where many drugs have been compromised and multi-resistant pathogens are common. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The current dogma is that increased AR has primarily resulted from greater antibiotic use in medicine and agriculture, which has progressively selected more AR strains. However, this perception is very naive and does not account for broader environmental influences that  are accelerating and exacerbating AR dissemination. Data are growing that shows AR proliferation is being significantly fueled by inadequate waste management and inconsistent sanitation around the world.

This has altered the local environmental AR gene pool (resistome) and created consequential “hot spots” of increased AR potential. Poor water quality in such locations has increased AR exposures via poor water (and water used for food production), which has caused a spiraling increase in AR where human population densities are high and water is chronically poor.  </span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Such hot spots are fuelling AR development around the world due to cross-boundary water movement and international travel. A huge percentage of serious multi-resistance in UK hospitals is seen in international travelers that have gained such resistance in hot spots; i.e., serious resistance is gained locally and migrates with the traveler. It then can seed AR in locations, such as the UK, which have adequate waste management and tighter antibiotic use control. Therefore, even if tighter controls are placed on antibiotic use in the UK and similar countries, it will not solve the problem of increasing AR in such countries. An international effort is urgently needed to aid and support “hot spot” countries, especially improving waste management systems and reducing self-prescription of unnecessary antibiotics.  </span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.06pt; padding-left:7.94pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Fewer antimicrobial drugs are being developed because the effective life of products has become so short that new drug discovery is uneconomical.
