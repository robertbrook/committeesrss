A further 19 grants helped acquire areas of </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">under 10 hectares. Thus, a very significant part of the original Land Fund’s business focused on relatively small areas of land which were often strategically important to communities for social or amenity use (such as extending or enhancing community buildings, footpaths and other access).

To clarify the Fund’s position on this matter, we would wish to see any land and buildings purchased compulsorily by local authorities in these circumstances transferred into the ownership of the communities concerned and not retained by the authorities. Although some local authorities are supportive of communities acquiring, owning and developing assets, as might be expected, the attitude of Scotland’s 32 Councils to this issue and their practice on it varies considerably.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">4.5</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Paragraph 8.8 relates how impressed the Scottish Labour Party leader, Johann Lamont, was following her visit to the </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Galson</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> Estate Trust.

It is for this reason, therefore, that we strongly support the view put forward by the West Harris Trust to the Scottish Government’s LRRG, as reported in paragraph 11.3 of the briefing paper, that the Community Right to Buy process should facilitate rather than hinder asset transfers to communities. This would enable community groups like the West Harris Trust to focus their energies on how they can make the best of the asset after acquisition, rather than on the acquisition itself.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">6.2</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">The Fund encourages all applicants that approach us for acquisition costs to investigate obtaining a discount in the transfer value. The Fund approaches applications to acquire public sector assets on a case by case basis and GCA has, in the past, supported a project where although the local authority sellers were unable to reduce the purchase price of the asset they were transferring to the community, they did transfer all of the asset’s fixtures and fittings at no cost.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">6.3</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">The value that public bodies attach to assets they wish to dispose of will, in the first place, determine whether or not communities can afford to buy them.

So that our funding can ‘go as far as possible’, we prefer, where possible, to see less of our funding going on the cost of acquiring the asset, and more on its future re-development. We think this will help ensure that the asset is financially sustainable in the longer term, and lead to more sustainable services and facilities for the communities we support. It must be strongly emphasised again, however, that this does not mean that GCA will not fund asset acquisition : it has done so and continues to do so.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">6.5</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">The remainder of section 11 of the briefing paper goes on to discuss State Aid.

Nevertheless, over the lifetime of GCA to date, most public bodies, including many local authorities and government departments or agencies, have found a variety of ways to transfer assets to community groups at less than market value (and sometimes at little or no cost at all) while still legitimately complying with the requisite rules and regulations. It is important to maintain that positive contribution to the community ownership agenda at a time of increased financial constraints for public bodies. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">7.</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">              </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Further potential reforms : The Crown Estate Commission</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">7.1</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">The grant programmes and investment areas that we have operated over the past 12 years have demonstrated the Big Lottery Fund’s firm commitment to the principle of the community ownership of assets.
