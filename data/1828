Recent examples West Coast Main Line (Department for Transport), G4S (LOCOG) and allegations of fraud by the Ministry of Justice against SERCO and G4S cast serious doubt on the likelihood that this form of commissioning can deliver best value or transfer risk. Risk transfer is frequently illusory.

Furthermore, the report found that SB had ‘misreported at least one of the KPIs around call handling in the contact centre’. This could have two significant impacts – first, it may mean that there were additional unforeseen costs incurred as the call volumes were adjusted to accommodate the data. Secondly, it may have meant that ‘erroneous data’ was being used at the time the council was re-negotiating the contract.

The KPIs consistently showed a very strong performance for housing repairs with very high levels of satisfaction and almost perfect performance in appointment keeping by repairs staff. As part of the scrutiny inquiry, members of the committee listened to fifty randomly selected recordings of telephone calls from residents to the repairs hotline. They found that many of the calls related to previously reported problems and missed appointments. They discovered that operatives would usually give a new reference number, even if the call was about an existing, uncompleted job. This meant the KPI would often record multiple repairs, even if only one had actually been carried out, and many would be recorded as completed within the target timescales, even if they took longer in reality. Under the contract, this also meant the council was often paying for multiple repairs when it should only have paid for one.
