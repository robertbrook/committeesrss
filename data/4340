After applications have been received the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">DfE</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> does not announce who has applied, instead ‘pre-approving’ those which it wants to back to open.

Another example is the approval last year of the Steiner Academy Frome, despite the fact that its impact assessment shows that it was opposed by most of the respondents to its consultation, by other local schools, by the local authority, and by the NHS Trust, with the Trust opposing because of ‘</span><span style="background-color:#ffffff; font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">the possible effect that a number of unimmunised children in one area could have. They are of the opinion that a Steiner school would attract children of families where immunisation is not the norm’.
