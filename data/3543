Nunn, who took over the running of Local Government Ombudsman Watch when I retired as director. Given the dishonesty and subterfuge endemic in the LGO institution that has been allowed to continue unchallenged for so long, neither Trevor nor I were confident that the LGO would provide the Committee with the detailed report instead</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> of the LGO's cherry-picked and sanitised version of its contents.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Anyone reading the survey results from a perspective of objectivity will see that they amount to a damning indictment of the culture of the LGO, presenting a picture of widespread demoralisation among LGO staff, very serious criticisms of the ombudsmen themselves, and complaints about an </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">intimidatory</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> blame culture in the LGO institution. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">In my attached extract, I have listed what seem to me to be the most serious evidence that the LGO is regarded by a large number of its own staff as being an institution riddled with bad practice and maladministration. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">I very much hope that members of the Committee will ask themselves whether the kind of institution described by the LGO's own staff in their survey could possibly be one that is consistent with the kind of institution described by Dr Richard Kirkham in the External Review he played such a significant part in producing. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">I include below a few quotations and statistics from my extract.

This is a highly misleading representation of the data to the public by the LGO, as although 34% of the respondents were indeed undecided about the statement, a further 27% positively disagreed with it, resulting in a total of 61% of respondents unable to affirm the statement because they were either unsure or actively disagreed with it.

The Internet has made the compelling evidence of systemic LGO bad practice and dishonesty freely available to complainants, and the fact the LGO seems to be finding it increasingly difficult to act with impunity, despite the assistance of its friends, has created internal tensions in the organisation that are highlighting its </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">dysfunctionality</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> and poor ethical ethos. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">I intend to be back in contact in due course with a further submission.
