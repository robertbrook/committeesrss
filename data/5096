A party does not have to refuse to take part; they simply fail to agree terms.  </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri;

font-size:12pt">If this innovation is to become a permanent fixture of British general elections, it would be desirable for some mechanisms to be established to facilitate negotiations, ensure some continuity and support fairness and balance.  The case made by this brief submission is that such a mechanism should recognise that parties and broadcasters are not the only stakeholders and to promote the interests of voters and democracy.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri;

font-size:12pt">The principal negotiations are between the political parties on the one hand and the broadcasters on the other.   In the absence of any inside track here it is reasonable to assume that parties want to use the debates to maximise votes while the broadcasters wish to maximise viewing figures.  The viewing electorate is, consequently, left as a passive stakeholder albeit one able to exercise a vote subsequently. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri;

font-size:12pt">There is an opportunity in operationalizing the negotiation process to ensure the interests (at least) of the electorate can be represented so as to open the discussion into one of three active stakeholder sets.  In doing so, the wider democratic interests might be represented in the negotiations and the subsequent format of the debates.  Increased use of social media might also enhance voter participation. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri;

Its terms of reference, however, should reflect the need to represent the interests of voters and the democratic process – including tacit interests.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="9" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.11pt; padding-left:3.89pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Such a body should be appointed by and answerable to Parliament, perhaps employing the Speaker’s office and appropriate Select Committees. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="10" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Existing broadcast regulation in respect of impartiality must be maintained as a central tenant of these broadcast debates.  Inclusion of all three major party leaders in the debate, as well as representation of other smaller parties (those not in national contention to form the government) elsewhere on broadcast networks, avoided judicial review in 2010 and such a continued approach would seem sensible. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="11" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">There is now the advantage of fixed term parliaments and, therefore, some certainty about the date of the next election. It is important that a lead time is built in for negotiations in the run up to the campaign and giving plenty of time. While some privacy can be afforded for the sake of reaching agreement, British people have come to expect openness in public life and there should be as much formal openness as possible in this case.  It would also be instructive for the proposed independent body to publish an assessment of the process and outcome, after the election. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="12" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Rules and guidance would emerge from the experience of negotiations over time, openness and the authority of Parliament in the body’s appointment should ensure parties would participate.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">January 2014</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:right"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">1</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
