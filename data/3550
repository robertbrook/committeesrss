Despite the lessons which should have been learned from the Kennedy Inquiry and the Francis Inquiry, the Trust and other NHS organisations in Bristol still prioritise reputation management over openness, transparency and learning. This has been demonstrated most recently in its defensive response to a warning notice served on it by CQC in October 2012 after </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">inspectors found that it had failed to meet three essential standards of quality and safety covering staffing levels, staff training and support, and the overall care and welfare of patients at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">3.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> When we met Monitor in February we agreed to provide further information and evidence for review.

We have asked to meet Monitor to discuss this. Its response is that the Information Commissioner is best placed to investigate these matters in the first instance. Monitor does not seem to appreciate that in order for the Information Commissioner’s Office to investigate alleged breaches of the Data Protection Act 1998, it first requires that we give the Trust the opportunity to respond to the allegations. Our experience is that the Trust’s usual response is to ignore them. We regard this as a matter for Monitor to deal with as the Trust’s regulator because this </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">behaviour</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> is a failure of the Trust’s governance which falls within Monitor’s remit. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">6.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> We told Monitor that in Bristol that there are still pockets of bullying and suppression of people (including patients and the public) who try to hold the NHS to account.

It is dealing with a Trust Board, including the Chief Executive and Chair, which commissioned a Histopathology Inquiry at public expense. The Inquiry was claimed to be Independent, ignored the most basic requirement to investigate the reasons for clinical and corporate governance failings and based its conclusions on a flawed case review. This was all accepted by the Trust Board. Consequently its opinions are of no reassurance to us because we regard its members as more interested in reputation management than safe care and we do not trust their judgement. Monitor seems unwilling to acknowledge that it is patients and the public who need to be assured that the service is safe. Secrecy does not provide any reassurance. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">16.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> As we stated in our evidence for the Committee’s Annual Accountability Hearing with CQC</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">we</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> should be able to raise our concerns with the Trust's public and patient governors and have them taken seriously.

This undermines the Trust’s obligation to be accountable to the patients and members of the public it serves. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">17.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> We wish to provide written evidence separately to this Committee and the Public Accounts Committees into the use by the NHS of Inquiries.
