text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Munro</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There are lots of small signs of progress, but we are trying to enhance the skill of the whole profession.  I am talking specifically </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">about </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">the social work dimension of child protection.  It is going to snowball, but you have to go slowly at the beginning to help more and more people to have expertise and also to work in organisations that encourage </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">them to practise well.  That is an important change.  The priorities now are about showing Ofsted whether you have been useful to children or not, rather than whether you have good records.  That is a very big culture change that takes time for people to get through.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">My impression is that authorities vary a great deal.  Some have leapt in with enthusiasm because they have always wanted to keep a clear focus on children.  Then you see that they are putting a lot of time and effort into making the work conditions and the support for front</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">-</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">line workers such that they can enhance their skills, that they can spend time with children and that they have the skills to talk to children.  My impression is about one-third of authorities are being quite impressive.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Munro</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: So many efforts have been made by very good people.  I would have thought its reputation is now such that a lot of people would avoid working there, which makes it even harder for them.  It is also about allowing them time to turn around and improve.  I noticed with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Doncaster</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> that they kept being inspected every year or so, which is destabilising, and you cannot realistically expect to transform the culture and the skill level within a few months, starting from where they are.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt;

font-size:12pt"> I just wanted to pick up your expression, “small signs of progress”.  You are saying one-third of authorities are doing good things.  Are you disappointed with the lack of progress that has been made since your report?  Is it reasonable that we have </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">made some small progress over that period of time, or will we see the snowball effect that you referred to?  Will we see a massive improvement over the next three years?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Munro</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is only last April that the Government revised “Working Together”, which has allowed a lot more flexibility to authorities so that they have a lot more freedom in redesigning the way they provide help and where their priorities are.  The new Ofsted framework, as well, is relatively new and that prioritises how well you are helping children.  It puts the emphasis on the quality of work, rather than </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">on </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">the quantity of recording.  Those changes were not very long ago.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond;

</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Alex Cunningham:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So your expectation is probably greater for the next two years than the progress made in the first two.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Munro</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes.  If I did not see substantial areas of very good practice in the next year or two, I would feel very disappointed.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-weight:bold">Professor Munro</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think so.  The ones that are making rapid changes are working with a very clear practice model, instead of saying, “Our job is to complete this series of forms”.  The two dominant ones that I know of are the Hackney model and the Signs of Safety model.  They both offer a whole organisational set of theories and practices </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">for </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> engaging well with families and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">exercising </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">good critical thinking about the safety of children.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Alex Cunningham:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You keep referring to “one-third of this” or “some of them”.  You keep using expressions like that.  What about the overall picture?  Are we going to see that overall picture?  The expectation out there in the world is that it is all falling apart because of some of the headline things, but can you expect that improvement across the piece to be reasonable?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Munro</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes.  In the way that you expect most health care to be reasonable, you should certainly expect that of social care.  It is achievable as long as it is not hijacked.  The recent spate of serious case reviews is of cases that I have no defence of.  If you get too vitriolic a media reaction and the public reaction, then you may encourage </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">authorities </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">to creep back into defensiveness, which </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">means </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">the blame </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">down.  People are quite rightly deeply distressed by what happened to those children.  Paradoxically, it is not helpful to blame professionals as if they did not care.  They do care. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt">that inadequacy. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> If you think of the Daniel Pelka case, the woman had had two boyfriends, where the two adults had been very violent to each other.  Then she got a third boyfriend, where the two of them stopped hitting each other and started hitting Daniel instead.  That is not a particularly predictable change.  The past pattern of behaviour was changed quite radically with the new boyfriend.  There is always an element with human beings that they go and do the unexpected.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt">.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">”  Time and skill, and then the other important dimension is that they do need a team that helps them emotionally, because some of these families are living lives that are very painful to hear about; to realise how awful a child’s life is, or how full of pain and fear, is not something you can just take at an intellectual level.  You do react to it in the way that the public react to the story of Daniel Pelka.  It stirs up very strong feelings in us, and so part of a good organisation is that it recognises how intensely emotional the work is.  Then, if you support the worker, they are able to get close to that child, because they know they can get help to say goodbye to that pain and not carry it home with them when they are looking after their own children.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt">what hinders, and the unexpected ways that things can end up contributing to a serious outcome.  In one case I looked at, one of the factors that led to the social workers not hearing the problems that the paediatrician was seeing was that the paediatrician wrote to the GP and copied in the social worker.  To the paediatrician, copying in the social worker meant they expected the social worker to read and act on the letter.  In the social work office, receiving a letter that was just copied in on a case that was closed meant it just went on the file, because they thought it would be addressed to them if it was asking them to do something.  Just clarifying that they had different rules and that they should agree on a shared rule minimises the chances of that happening in the future.  I know it is a trivial thing, but these trivial things, if you correct enough of them, start to make a difference.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">Perhaps I ought to start with you, Isabelle; congratulations on your appointment.  You have just listened to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Professor Munro</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What Eileen talked about is that things take time and there are a lot of things are in place.  What we are all waiting for is what I would describe as the tipping point.  There is a whole system change going on here, and we need to get things to a point where we are seeing really dramatic change in the frontline.  My expertise is about that interface between social workers and families and that is what is most important.  We now have to see a step change in that interaction.  That is very much about implementation of the reform agenda on the frontline.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt"> Is it your perception that there is broad acceptance of the direction of travel?  If we went back to Victoria Climbié and the inquiries after that, you would have said then that there was an intense period of change, and you are waiting for the changes to come through and bear fruit.  I have sat on this Committee for a number of years now, and it sometimes feels as if you get a new bunch of people sitting in front of you, telling you that things were not very good five years ago, they are improving now and they are all going to get better.  Just five years on you get a different bunch of people sitting in front of you, optimistically telling you the same thing.  One of the jobs is trying to work out when we really are on the right track and when there is just that optimism bias that involves people on the frontline; it is not that they are not genuine, but it is about whether they are right or not.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Isabelle Trowler</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: One of the really significant changes is that we have a structure now and an opportunity to bring the professional voice into play.  Over the last few years, at those times that you referred to, employers, academics and politicians hav</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">e had </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">huge influence on what happens to the profession.  Since the Munro Review, we have an architecture in place that enables the professional voice to come to the fore.  We have been given this opportunity to bring ourselves to the table and be influential in decision</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">making, and we now have to step up to the mark and act on that.  We have the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">College</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt"> I suppose, in a way, one role both of you would be expected to play is to defend the profession and that space, in order to allow that progress to happen.  Ultimately, if the profession does not step up then some politician or other will come in with some alternative idea, a good one or otherwise.  In the meantime, you need to defend the space, so that bad headlines and new Secretaries of State do not just overturn the position we are in now.  Would you agree with that?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Isabelle Trowler</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Not entirely, no.  I love social work; I think it has a huge contribution to make to public service.  I have seen jaw-droppingly brilliant practice taking place that really </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">changes families’ lives.  I absolutely support social work; it is all I have ever done, but I am also probably its harshest critic as well.  Too often we do not do the job that we are meant to be doing.  I see my role as very much about championing the potential of the profession and sharing excellence and good practice, but also being able to offer some challenge.  Implementation is a real issue, and it requires attention to detail.  You do not change local or national systems by not paying attention to real detail and that real day-to-day stuff that goes on.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt"> Do you see your role as also to stand up to Ministers and sometimes say, “Hey”, when they are getting driven by headlines, or the Chamber is going mad here, and they are under enormous pressure to be seen to be doing something?  Is it your role to say, “Actually, you need to see this in perspective and you need to give the profession the space to carry on making improvements, which are there, even if it is not publicly perceived as yet”?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Isabelle Trowler</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Absolutely.  My role is certainly about advising Government on what I think might be the most sensible way forward.  When </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Professor Munro</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> gave evidence when the Committee sat last, she said, “Let’s hope Government holds its nerve</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">”  It is absolutely right that we give the reform agenda time, but we have to have a sharp focus on improvement, and we have to see signs of things moving in the right direction.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Annie Hudson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I would concur with a lot of what Isabelle has just said.  In terms of the passage of time since the publication of your report, there is real consensus within social work, but also amongst employers and academics, about what the problem of social work is.  There is less consensus and less consistency, as yet, about how we make that real and how we address those problems.  As Isabelle has just said, it is about realising some of the ambitions that are behind the reform agenda.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We do have a number of levers there to make the reforms happen, to be really embedded and to be consistently embedded.  That was a very important theme with what </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Professor Munro</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> was saying about the one-third of authorities versus the two-thirds.  We do have some of those levers; the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt"> Do we have the political buy-in?  Local authorities are ultimately run by councillors.  Elected councillors either support early intervention, the long</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Annie Hudson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: In my experience, local politicians do get what good child protection is about, and they know that it is a really important priority, particularly in these very difficult spending rounds.  The issue about the protection of early help is trickier, and clearly in some areas that is much more under threat.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There are also additional risks currently.  Following on from what Eileen was saying, we do need to have some stability of leadership, in terms of driving these reforms through, and we do know that in some local authorities, particularly in the wake of difficult Ofsted inspections </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">or difficult serious case reviews, there is a lot of turbulence in terms of the leadership.  That does not make it easier to embed some of the reforms that we have been discussing.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The biggest challenge is about making sure that every social worker in every team in local authorities, but also in voluntary organisations as well, has the skills, the knowledge and the emotional resilience.  One of the things we have been doing since the publication of your report is publishing curriculum guides.  For example, in relation to child protection, for social workers at the end of their first year, which is called the assessed and supported year of employment—ASYE—we have now published a curriculum guide about the child protection knowledge and capabilities people need to have at the end of their first year post-qualifying.  We will be looking to develop that for further stages in people’s careers.  We have done quite a lot of work about publishing curriculum guides </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">on </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">the capabilities and using the professional capabilities framework—the PCF—to help people have a common language about the skills and competencies people need to have to do good-quality child protection work.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There have been blows to the status of social work in very recent weeks.  Whenever you have reviews like we had recently, with the Daniel Pelka and Keanu Williams serious case reviews, those inevitably engender difficult political and public debates.  When those serious case reviews have come up, we have tried to use that as an opportunity to convey to the public and the media what social work is about.  There is this continued issue that because most people do not have direct experience of social workers, they immediately resort to prejudice and stereotype of social workers.  We have tried to use those opportunities, partly to explain what </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Isabelle Trowler</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I am very clear that there is an expectation that I speak my mind.  It is a permanent senior Civil Service job, so I am there to support the Government of the day.  I am very clear about that.  The last eight weeks has shown me that people expect me to have a professional position in relation to the things that the Department is doing, and that I feel entirely comfortable with working alongside the Department but maintaining my own independence.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Can I just say a couple of things about training, on the back of what Annie is saying?  There are a couple of things on my mind.  First, I think absolutely there is a sense that the calibre of social work students coming off programmes is getting better.  I have two examples.  Probably about 18 months ago I was marking a lot of assessments of people coming into a particular authority.  I suddenly got this batch of brilliant papers, so I contacted the authority and asked what this was about.  They said it was a cohort from Step Up to Social Work, so we need to acknowledge that there is some significant progress.  I was in an authority last week, talking to a large number of social workers, and in that authority they have just managed to recruit 48 fantastic newly qualified social workers.  Something is happening out there, and we need to acknowledge that progress.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What I would say, though, is that, in terms of education and training, I am not convinced that we are teaching social workers what they need to know.  That might be at qualification</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">level and it might be in terms of continuous professional development.  I hope that we will make some more progress on that once the review of social work education comes from Sir Martin Narey.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt"> Following up on placements, I remember when we were doing our inquiry, going into children’s social work, with all the massive challenges of doing that, in your placement a) you did not need to be supervised by a trained social worker; and b) in order to become a children’s social worker, your placement did not require you to have done a children’s social work placement.  Can you assure us that both of those things have been addressed?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Isabelle Trowler</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There is still a debate about how ready you should be once you qualify as a social worker.  These are the debates that will come out of the social work education review: do we need more specialist training?  What is the quality of placements that we are providing?  What is the quality of clinical supervision that is being provided within those arrangements?  I would not be confident to say that we have cracked that.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Isabelle Trowler</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The responsibility for that lies with the employer.  You will have newly qualified social workers coming in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">who </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">will have had a range of different experiences, both in terms of the classroom and practice experience.  The employer has an absolute responsibility to judge that that person is fit for practice, or else I presume they would not have employed them, and then of course there is the assessed year in employment, which is a further 12 months in which newly qualified social workers are meant to be protected, in terms of case work, but also accessing very good-quality supervision. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Annie Hudson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Theoretically that is possible, but I think in the vast majority of cases, that is not the case.  Certainly my experience, when I was in Bristol as the DCS, is that people would come into statutory children’s teams having had children’s placement experience and having been well</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">supervised by practice teachers.  You are quite right that there is an issue about making sure that we have really good</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">quality practice teaching available to every single social work student—we know that there are patches in the country where that is not the case—and that people have access to a statutory child</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">care placement, which I absolutely think is a complete prerequisite of getting employment in a statutory childcare team.  Most good employers would see it that way.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt"> I want to go back to Isabelle’s point when she finished off about local government.  We heard from Professor Munro that she thought two</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">thirds of our authorities were underperforming in some way or another.  My first question is about how you are going to tackle local authorities in general.  There are a lot of them, so how are you going to interface with them?  My second point is about whether you agree with Professor Munro on her analysis, and the extent to which you think that is something you can help with.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Isabelle Trowler</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: When we are looking at inspection results—and there has been some controversy around this very recently—we have to bear in mind that they tend to be one</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">word judgments, so within the “adequate” or “inadequate” categories you will have a huge variation.  You will have some authorities that are really struggling hugely, and then you will have other authorities with the same grading that will have a pocket of problematic practice in one part of the system.  We have to bear that in mind.  The headlines of inspections give us an indication of what lies behind, and it is really important that we get the proper narrative about what is happening in practice. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The emergence of the Principal Social Worker Network is really important, and we have a lot of work to do in getting local authorities to help them think about how that position can be used so that clinical practice gets the visibility and status that it needs in local government.  I have met with the ADCS president a couple of times; we will have a close working relationship, and it goes back to the point about whether I am here to defend the profession </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">or challenge it.  I think it is both.  It is about having that professional dialogue around the table, as well as employers, politicians and academics.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">r</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.  I think there is a culture of disrespect as well as collaboration.  I said to my staff that we had to have high regard for the contribution that partners make.  Obvious partners would be schools, who are working with the children that we work with every single day.  They know those kids inside-out.  We have to offer huge respect and regard for the contribution that schools make.  Again, the health contribution in child protection is enormous; we depend on psychology, psychiatry, and child and adolescent mental health services.  We have to acknowledge the huge contribution that those agencies make.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The other message that I would want to give is that we must get our own house in order.  Too often, where there are problems locally, the tendency is to look immediately to the wider partnership agenda and to look at the fault lines within the whole system.  That, of course, is part of the picture, but actually, in my experience as a leader, you must focus on your own business first, and generate the respect and credibility that you need to have in order for effective partnerships to work.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">quality communication; we had an interesting example from Professor</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Munro earlier on.  It is not just that people do not talk to each other, and why they might not.  It is sometimes about how they hear information in a different way and they reinterpret it, so it maybe becomes less serious or more serious.  Thirdly, to create a really accurate picture of what life is like for a child, it is about how we bring to the table the different specialisms and bits of knowledge, and to do that in a way that the sum is greater than the parts.  That is a piece of work that we are looking to do with the other professional colleges.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">maybe we can do with other organisations is to look at some of the evidence about, for example, some of the multi</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

there is quite a lot of research evidence.  Picking up on the Pelka review, that clearly highlighted the issue of children living in households where there is domestic violence and/or alcohol abuse, and we know that the numbers are very, very significant.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The challenging question is how we best help those children.  That is where you get into some of the preventive help and help at an early stage, as well as when statutory social care needs to intervene on a stronger footing.  That evidence is coming at us at a time when everyone is having to look very carefully at their resources and how they deploy them.  My sense is that in very many local authorities around the country, partly because they are having to do precisely that and having to make strong arguments to local politicians about continuing to invest in early help, people are getting better at being clear about need in their local communities and the variations of need, but also </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">about </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">what kind of interventions are going to have most effect.  We have moved away from a rather woolly approach to early help, which was perhaps characteristic in some parts of the system 10</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">years ago, into being much clearer about the kinds of interventions and practice that really will make a difference and where it is worth investing, and where, although people may like the idea of investing in a particular kind of service, there is no evidence to suggest that it is going to have a positive impact.  Those debates need to continue.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt">those </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">to them.  In other areas, it comes over seamlessly without problem, straightforwardly, under exactly the same regulatory and legal framework.  It is an ongoing issue.  </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt"> On the whole issue of ensuring we have sufficient numbers of right-qualified people in the social work profession, Isabelle, you have already referred in glowing terms to people who have submitted work on the Step Up to Social Work programme.  How does </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Frontline </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">fit in with this and what is the likely success of that, briefly?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Isabelle Trowler</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I absolutely support Frontline.  I had some personal involvement in the original teaching design and curriculum design.  It is a very, very small cohort of students.  It will tell us some things that we do not know, like whether work</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">based learning for qualifying programmes is a good way of supporting social workers; whether the arrangement of having—a little like the old social work student unit model—a small cluster of social work students coming together under the daily supervision of a high</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">quality clinical supervisor makes a substantial difference.  One of the key interests I have in relation to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Frontline </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">is what they are being taught.  It is a very prescriptive skills</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">based curriculum that addresses many of the deficits that have been talked about here today.  However, I appreciate that there is concern about whether enough can be taught in the timeframe that has been given, and that that is absolutely what we need to test.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt">year programme with assessed placement.  I look at the practice learning guidance, which includes 30</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">days for development, for skills, and for practice.  Is that really sufficient for some of the environments that these people are going to go into?  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Annie Hudson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: That is not the only space in which people will be developing their skills.  It goes back to the issue that was raised earlier on about the quality of practice placements.  Practice placements should be absolutely a place where people are developing, extending and being challenged about their skills, as well as their knowledge, through good quality supervision.  We have to be very clear about what we think social workers should be able to do at the end of their initial qualifying and, going back to the earlier point I made, in my view that does need to be linked into a much more coherent and more robust framework for continuing professional development.  We do need to have—the College has a role but so has the HCPC—probably some stronger quality-assurance processes in place, so that we are clear about the courses and the programmes that are delivering consistently good students and those that are struggling, because that has been part of the narrative recently.  There are some programmes that do deliver some very, very high-calibre practitioners.  Step</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Up is one of those, but there are many other programmes as well—MA, postgraduate and degree level.  However, there are some that have not been able to do that for all sorts of reasons, and we need to get more of a grip on that.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Isabelle Trowler</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We had a conversation about that earlier.  One of the things that we were saying is how much of that is to do with the changes that are happening at a local level, where we see a creation of people directorates, so portfolios for directors are changing, and that that might have something to do with it.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Annie Hudson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes, that is right.  An ex</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">DCS colleague said that the average life of a DCS now is 33</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">months; I do not know where that figure came from.  That is one factor.  There is clearly some correlation with some of those departures with difficult Ofsted judgments and, indeed, serious case reviews.  There may also be a generational factor around the age of a number of directors and getting towards retirement age.  That is possibly another factor, and it is something that we have been aware of for some time.  Those three factors together have probably created a very difficult position.  The issue about leadership and unstable leadership is important, in terms of taking forward this reform agenda in a rigorous and vigorous way, because there is something about the story of reform and wanting to make sure that everybody is signed up and committed to taking things forward.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Annie Hudson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I am not sure that we have evidence that social workers are leaving the profession more than they did hitherto.  In some places, in some local authorities, clearly, particularly when people get into a difficult position, you do see haemorrhage out, for reasons that people can probably understand.  That does not necessarily mean that they are lost to social work.  They may go and work in other authorities, or in the voluntary or independent sector.  There is evidence that something like one in four social workers leaving qualifying training do not go on and get employment as social workers, but in a sense they have not even begun their social work careers.  There are some risks in the current situation, and there are also some grounds for optimism.  It is for us within the profession, for employers and, most importantly, for social workers to grasp the promise of the reform agenda and make it work.  If we do not do that, then the grounds for pessimism will come much more to the fore.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;
