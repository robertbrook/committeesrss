I suppose if you are asking what we are doing about wanting to encourage them, the area where part-time study has not fallen off and, indeed, it is positive, there is real growth, is in higher education provided in further education colleges. That is something we have actively promoted. We want to see higher education widened and through a range of providers and FE colleges have a particular, distinctive role. They may be better than conventional universities at picking up people wanting a second start in life, which is where a lot of the part-time students come from. We have also supported adult participation in other ways through the FE sector, so that may be one way in which we can address the adverse trend, but I frequently meet the sector.

The new funding, which is where they are currently out in the market at the moment looking for private sector partners, involves things like new banking institutions that are funding debt in new ways for companies. We hope that some of the new challenger banks may be able to draw on the Business Bank, but that is how it will operate. It will not operate through a high street facade. Maybe people are frustrated and are saying, “Where is the Business Bank? It is not in our area.” It is not intended to be. The leverage that it can obtain in this way is already very striking and through the projects that have already been negotiated—I have forgotten the ratio but it is something like 1:10—we think we can do far more with taxpayers’ money than lending it out directly. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 5.7pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q66 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Walker</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I hope that turns out to be the case.

One of his proposals was to have two new challenger banks. Well, we have just created two new challenger banks out of Lloyds and RBS. It was not straightforward, because there are quite complex issues about dividing up the technology platforms, but that has happened. There is a wide range of challenger banks now coming into the market. We had many of them around the table in my Department a couple of weeks ago, looking at the problems they face in terms of getting access to the clearance network and so on. These things are happening and there is a lot of innovation and the Business Bank is very much behind that. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">One thing I have not mentioned and where I would qualify my earlier response to you is there is one area where we do effectively do direct lending, which is through the Start Up Loans scheme.

It is partly making sure that institutions like the Regional Growth Fund are effective. There was some initial criticism of it, but we now feel very pleased with the quality of the projects, the amount of private sector leverage that they are obtaining, so continuing building on the Regional Growth Fund would be No.1.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">No. 2 would be improving the overall performance of the Local Enterprise Partnerships. They are, necessarily, of variable quality and varying degree of readiness. We are trying to avoid a dependency culture. We try to encourage them to develop on their own with some core funding, so the work that I do and the Minister of State, Mr Fallon, does with the Local Enterprise Partnerships is crucial.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The third step will be next financial year, when there is a much bigger pot of funding under which the local growth arrangements can work, most of them operating through the LEPs, some of them through a City Deal type arrangement.

You talk about ensuring that the Regional Growth Fund leverages private funds in, but how are you going to measure the success of that? You talked about the variable quality of LEPs; that in itself is a difficulty. There are difficulties of it being between Departments; it is not entirely within your gift in BIS. There are quite a few challenges there. What processes do you have in place to measure the effectiveness and success of those things?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Vince Cable</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">If you are talking about a central body like the Regional Growth Fund, there are established metrics that are used in terms of value for money, benefit-cost ratio, jobs created</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> There is always going to be an argument about how much is genuinely additional. That is an inherent problem when you are supporting new investment: would they have done it anyway? We think we do it in a rigorous way. The Public Accounts Committee are there to hold us to account, to make sure that we are giving accurate and meaningful analysis, so there is a process in respect of the Regional Growth Fund that is now, I think, pretty impressive.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In terms of how you measure the performance of the Local Enterprise Partnerships, that is more difficult. The whole point about letting go and letting local organisations, including local government, have more discretion is that you lose control of what they do and, indeed, of its impact. We go back to the arguments that were at the heart of the Heseltine report: do you try to do these things out of central Government and control them and measure them and have tight control of performance, or do you just cut some of the umbilical cord to central Government and let local organisations flourish, in which case some of them will make mistakes?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 5.7pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q72 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mike Crockart</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Equally, though, there is a balance between just throwing money at a problem and hoping that it does what you want and making sure that you are getting value for money for that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Vince Cable</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Exactly.

Of the ones that operate centrally, the only exception is UK Export Finance, which operates separately, but all of the others are now rationalised and operate within a common framework and a common system of management, so we have anticipated that criticism and have addressed it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">A more difficult issue is all the various schemes related to business advice.

We have had a substantial devaluation in the back of 2008 and 2009 of 25% overall and it is disappointing that that has not resulted in a big increase in export performance and import substitution, as it should have done. Economics tells us that should have happened and it did not and probably the main reason is the fact that half of our visible exports are to the European area, and of course you know about the eurozone crisis.

We have not talked about the RAB charge issue. As I am sure you know—you follow this closely—the RAB charge has increased significantly, mainly because of different projections of earnings growth. If, on the back of this recovery, earnings growth were to recover substantially in the next few years, the RAB charge would come back down again. It is a volatile statistic, and of course we have to have a number; that is the methodology that we employ. It does not affect the real world, but as part of our long</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">term accounting we have to have it. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q91 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Paul Blomfield:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I very much appreciate that and we had a lengthy discussion with the Universities Minister last week, where he was talking about the modelling the Department is doing based on an anticipation that there might be a longer period of lower than anticipated earnings and therefore just to get some sense of what the impact of that would be.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Vince Cable</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We are happy to share the modelling with you as best we can. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q92 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> That would be very helpful. Just before we conclude our questions, could I pick up one issue that you raised yourself? That is the Start Up Loan fund. Can I make it clear that I think this is very important? It fills a gap in the market that is not provided by other, more conventional financial institutions, but it is very much needed and, I believe, is quite successful in terms of the applicants. There has been some press criticism, I believe, of the lack of accountability of the money. Now, bearing in mind, inevitably, such a fund is going to have a higher risk profile than others, could you just say what you are doing to try to blunt any attacks on that fund in terms of accountability for public finance?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Vince Cable</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I am not sure I can answer concretely. The key issue with the Start Up Loan scheme goes back to the previous question, it is the RAB charge: what default rate you assume. That is what the Public Accounts Committee and indeed your Committee will want to know. These are very early days and there is quite a small default rate, as you would expect; they have not been going very long. After a year, who knows? The Prince’s Trust has a default rate of 40% or something, so if we do better than that we would be doing particularly well in terms of the integrity of the loans. Your question is a perfectly fair one. It is taxpayers’ money and some of it will be lost and we do need to have a proper system of measuring this. I am sure our people do. It is a question of how we then feed it into the accountability mechanisms, isn’t it?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Martin Donnelly</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes. The other aspect that we do try to be aware of and you will be aware of, which is difficult to put a monetary value on, is people who fail in six months or a year may restart more successfully in two or three years. Our figures do not pick that up, but it is a reality and it is very important socially as well as economically. We do need to take a broad view of this while making sure we safeguard the money wherever we can.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q93 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes, I quite understand that.
