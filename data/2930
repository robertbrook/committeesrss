The forthcoming election offers an important opportunity to broaden the space for women to participate in public decision-making and take positions of public office. Research by Oxfam and partners has repeatedly shown that women in Myanmar are excluded - often systematically - from decision making at all levels of society. DFID's future programming should provide support to raise awareness on women's rights and encourage political parties to put in place measures that ensure greater numbers of women are represented in their ranks. This will be </span><span style="color:#1a1a1a; font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt">key</span><span style="color:#1a1a1a; font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt"> to having more women participate in the forthcoming election, and in the longer term to reducing gender inequality across all spheres of activity and securing a brighter democratic and economic future for Myanmar. DFID's future programming should also support the government to fully implement the National Strategic Plan for the Advancement of Women and provide support to civil society to monitor the government's progress on the implementation of this strategy. Gender Based Violence is widespread in Myanmar and has also a deeply limiting impact on women's capacity to engage in economic activity.

DFID should work closely with the government to ensure that its process of engagement with civil society on the EITI is as broad, deep and inclusive as possible. Whilst the EITI as a process works to achieve greater transparency in the extractives industry as a whole and of the contractual payments by companies in particular, it does not address the concerns around the contract content and the fairness of the agreed contracts, nor does it necessarily provide a vehicle for political solutions to those problems.
