The Office of Parliamentary Counsel pamphlet on consent states, “The issue of consent is entirely a matter of House procedure and becomes redundant once a Bill has received Royal Assent”.

It is certainly not a matter of statute, and I would see no case for it being a matter of statute. Were the arrangement to be changed, it would not require, for example, primary legislation. It would be something that would be in the hands of both Houses.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">David Beamish</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: If I could add to that, I think what that quotation is saying is that, from the lawyers’ point of view, they need not look behind the Bill once it has passed. If this Committee were to recommend a change, certainly in the Lords following precedent, we would start by doing an address to the Crown, inviting the Queen to put her prerogative and interests at our disposal, so we could review the procedures, but that is an internal choice.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Robert Rogers</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: From the Commons’ perspective, I think an address would probably be the right course as well.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q5 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Fabian </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Hamilton</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Why is consent necessary in addition to Royal Assent, particularly given that if the need for consent is not noticed until after a Bill has received Royal Assent, the legislation is still valid?

If there is </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">an informality</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> in the process of passing a Bill—I would not like to imply that we are constantly making mistakes, but even in the best regulated circles the odd mistake does happen—that sort of informality, nothing at all to do with legislative consent, certainly would not deprive a statute of its legitimacy. Of course, with article 9 of the Bill of Rights, the court could not look behind the process of passing that. It is a wholly different phenomenon from Royal Assent. From my perspective, and I think David may agree with this, I see it as part of the comity between what are after all the three parts of Parliament, the Queen, the Queen in Parliament and the two Houses. That sort of comity or </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">courtesy reflects the relations that there </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">are</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> between the two Houses, so I would see it rather in that light.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">David Beamish</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: I certainly agree and I have in front of me Professor Brazier’s evidence to you, paragraph 24.2, where he uses much the same formula, “The requirement of royal consent is matter of comity between Parliament and the Crown”. So in one sense it is not necessary, in that this Committee could recommend its abolition, but it chimes with other ways in which the three parts of Parliament work together.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q6 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Fabian </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Hamilton</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> We had evidence from Dr Tucker from the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">University</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">York</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, which is where I got my degree, and he told us that, “Consent lacks a compelling constitutional justification”.

It is not central to our constitutional arrangements. In terms of the justification, I think that is something that you, as a Committee, will no doubt form a view on, and I would not add to my previous remark about comity, which from my point of view sums it up.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">David Beamish</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: Whether it is compelling or not is perhaps a matter for this Committee.

He recited in his paragraph 23 possible reasons or arguments for treating consent as passing the third limb of the Jennings test, that is to say there is a reason for the rule, but it seems to me that what Robert said in the previous answer, and what I quoted from Professor Brazier, gives a perfectly respectable reason.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q7 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> If Parliament was minded to abolish consent, what would need to be done?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Robert Rogers</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: I think we go back to the route of the address, which we mentioned a few minutes ago.

I am always discouraging about the possibility of primary legislation where the workings of Parliament are concerned, but in this case I do not think that it would be a question that would arise.

It is analogous in a way to the Government providing a money resolution for a Private Member’s Bill. It is possible for the Government to say, “No, we don’t like this Bill, so we are not going to provide a money resolution for it.” That would inhibit or possibly prevent debate. When I was Clerk of Legislation—and I think </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Jacqy</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Sharpe, the current incumbent—we would always say to the Government that is a misuse of the privilege of financial initiative.

Could you describe what exactly </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">is your role</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Richard Heaton</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: This is a part of the law-making process that we do our best dutifully to service. As the previous witnesses explained, it is a rule or convention or custom of Parliament. It is a matter between Parliament and the sovereign. When we are preparing a Bill ready to be introduced, there are a number of things that we have to check and get in order and we correspond or telephone or get in touch with the Clerk’s staff on matters like scope, whether money cover is needed, whether Queen’s or Prince’s consent is needed. Generally speaking, we take an initial view because we know the precedents. We then discuss it with the Clerk of Legislation in each House and, as the Clerks have explained, their view is the authoritative one. We then communicate that to the Department. The Department then writes to the respective royal households in a fairly standard way and await a response.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q27 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> The Palace has to be given 14 days notice of the requirement for consent and the relevant Department has to write a letter copied to the sovereign’s solicitors setting out the purpose of the Bill and how it affects the Crown.

It is more than a pure formality. It does require a substantive letter and the letter writer to apply their mind to it. As you have seen from the guidance, the letter is copied to </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Farrer’s</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. It is not for me to </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">speculate, but no doubt </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Farrer’s</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> can explain to the royal household quite what this Bill is doing. There are substantive bits of correspondence going on. It is one of the things that you have to cover when you are preparing a Bill. There are many other hurdles you have to negotiate and things you have to do, so it is one of those really.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q28 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Can you see any way in which that process could be made simpler?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Richard Heaton</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">: I read the Clerks’ note on that with interest. On the transparency point, on which they thought of some helpful suggestions, I looked at the parliamentary website last night. You go Bill by Bill, and I could not spot a bit of information saying, “This Bill has received or has not received”. I do not know whether that would be useful. It might be confusing because people might confuse it with Royal Assent, which of course is something entirely different. So in the transparency vein, there are probably more things you could do to signal that this is one of those Bills and has received Queen’s or Prince’s consent. As for simplifying the procedure, copying a letter to the Duchy of Cornwall or to </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Farrer’s</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> is not an enormous burden.

They start from different places, don’t they? The sovereign is one of the tripartite parts of legislature. So at the Royal Assent end of the process it is very clear that the House of Commons, the House of Lords and the sovereign all have to give their agreement to a piece of legislation. The Queen’s consent starts from a different end of the telescope, which is the comity between Parliament and the sovereign. The sovereign has a range of prerogative and other interests, which Parliament on the whole does not encroach into. The Queen’s consent is the sovereign saying, “I put these at the disposal of Parliament for you to legislate as you see fit.” It is a different sort of process.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Slightly anticipating the next question: does it add anything and is it a relic? I suppose for me—and you will take a view on this—it is a living reminder of the constitutional settlement whereby the sovereign actually does, as a matter of constitutional convention, place her interests at the disposal of Parliament. It is one of those </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">sort</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> of customary, slightly formal aspects of our constitution that reminds us of how we have got to where we are.
