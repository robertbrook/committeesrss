First of all, I</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">should declare the fact that James Patrick is a serving police constable with the Metropolitan Police, but he lives in my constituency. This evidence session arises out of the accident that Mr</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Patrick is my constituent, and he came to see me about his disciplinary case and the situation he has found himself in. I make no comment about that in this forum, nor should his disciplinary hearing be referred to in this evidence session, as we are going to treat that as what we call sub </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">judice</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. That is not for </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">discussion. I just feel I ought to say that Mr</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Patrick is my constituent, which is how he came to be here.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Secondly, it is only fair to say that Dr Rodger Patrick and Constable James Patrick are not related. There is no connection between them, even by marriage. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Thirdly, I want to put on record how grateful I am for the written evidence we have received and how, personally, I am truly shocked by what I have read, for two reasons: shocked that apparently such manipulation of police statistics could possibly happen on such a wide scale and become so institutionally prevalent, and shocked that we have known about it for such a long time and so little has changed as a result of that public knowledge of this problem. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Finally, I just wish to make another point about privilege. Whatever you say in this session is privileged. That is, so long as you believe it to be true and sincerely believe it to be true, you can say whatever you like without fear or favour, because no court, disciplinary hearing or other tribunal can use in evidence against you anything you say in this Committee. That is obviously a privilege not to be abused. That means we also cannot, as I said, refer to the disciplinary hearing in question, or indeed to the case of the five officers in a certain constabulary who are subject to proceedings regarding their alleged manipulation of data. You may be aware of the case in question.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I have one other formality, which is to welcome Sheila Gilmore to this Committee, newly elected.

May I ask each of you to give a view? Perhaps I could start with Dr Patrick. Can you just describe what techniques, which you have described in your written evidence, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">tend</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> to be used by police officers to alter the outcome of the statistical measures that we use for recording crime?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Rodger Patrick:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Certainly, sir. There are a number of techniques that come under what police officers would call the generic term of “cuffing”, which is making crime figures disappear up the sleeve, in reference to the magician’s art. The actual method would be, when someone reports a crime, to disbelieve them and not record it at all—say they are making it up and that it is a false report. Secondly, they may well record it as lost property. Another technique would be to record a sequence of crimes in the same street—say, five or six cars that have been broken into with different owners—as just one crime, so a continuous offence rule. You could also massage the figures by de</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">recording</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> crimes, de</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">categorising</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> them. So a senior officer would look at a crime report and decide that no crime had occurred, and inappropriately take it off the books. Then you have other methods whereby you downgrade burglaries to theft from property, and attend burglaries as criminal damage.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> That is all under the term “cuffing”.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Rodger Patrick:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q3 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> about nodding?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Rodger Patrick:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Nodding is another matter altogether. That is about collusion between offenders and police officers to improve the detection rate, where a deal is reached with the offender for them to admit a number of offences, thus making the performance of the force look good in term of detections, in return for inducements. That is either through charging less serious offences and TIC</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">ing</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> more serious ones, so that the sentence is reduced, or through an agreement to produce the offender from prison after they have been sentenced and take them on a nodding exercise, where they drive around and nod at properties that they supposedly have broken into. That improves the detection rate. Sometimes inducements in the form of sex, alcohol, access to meals etc. are offered on those occasions when they are brought out of prison. That is nodding.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q4 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">Chair</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What is skewing?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Rodger Patrick:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Skewing is putting your resources into the areas that you are being measured in. If your performance measures are to reduce burglary, you put your resources into investigating burglaries at the cost of investigating something like rape or child protection. You move your resources accordingly. Sometimes you will see forces systematically move resources out of inner</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">city areas to more affluent areas where crime is easier to detect. Generally that is not done deliberately, but the way that the formulas are used can result in that occurring.

I transferred to the Metropolitan Police in October</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">2009. On my transfer, I had a background in intelligence analysis, which I had been doing at my previous force, so I had a good concept of the measurement of crime, how to analyse it correctly, the different types of brackets of crime, and some of the tricks that Rodger has described. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I came initially to a response team. My experience on that response team essentially was to do with robberies first of all, in that robbery offences—and I do mean clear robbery offences—would be </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">downgraded</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. In the Met, they used to do so through an offence called theft</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">snatch</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, which does not actually exist; it is not recognised by the Home Office.

It was a non</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">existent type of crime, and this would happen even in clear cases where there was CCTV showing a robbery taking place. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The extent of this on the borough that I was initially on was large.

Things were clearly being reported as burglaries; you would then re</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">run</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> the same report. There had been a human intervention, i.e. a management intervention, and those burglaries had effectively disappeared in a puff of smoke.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I then was put into another specialist role, this time with Specialist Crime and Operations, working on the crime fighters team, which effectively once a month gathers together the headline performance data for Specialist Crime and Operations at a very senior level, so you are talking about Assistant Commissioner, Chief Superintendents and Commanders sat in the room to discuss what has happened in that month. As part and parcel of that in July, I did some analysis around serious sexual offences and rape. In the course of doing that, I found that no</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">crimes</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, which is a way effectively of establishing that a report is no longer a crime to be investigated, were incorrect in about 80% of cases. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> 80%?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">James Patrick</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes. That is my professional opinion based on what I looked at. It was 80% of cases. I went on to look at crime</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">related</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> incidents, which is another very Met</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">centric</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> type of thing. It is where effectively you say, “Yes, crime has occurred, but it is a third</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">party report”. That would be the general rule for when you would use a crime</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">related</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> incident instead of a crime, so the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">victim</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has not confirmed it to you face-to-face; it is a referral from another agency. In reviewing those, I found that in 70% of cases they should not have been crime</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">related</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> incidents; they were clear crimes.

The Crime Management Unit is effectively a special oversight unit; when crime reports are </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">logged</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, it is their job to review the individual reports to make sure that they have been done ethically, done properly, are not  </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">misrecorded</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> as no</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">crimes</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and are not  </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">misrecorded</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> as crime</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">related</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> incidents. The summary of that conversation was that, across all OCUs, which are Operational Command Units, officers were chancing it asking for no</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">crimes</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, but that this was most prevalent in respect of sexual offences. CMU, which is the Crime Management Unit, were doing their best, but with too limited a resource to ensure that it was kept only to a minimum. Effectively, they have not got enough staff to keep a lid on it. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">They went on to say that, normally, the crime</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">related</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> incident is recorded because the initial report is third-party, which is actually within the rules, but after four weeks or so, which could be 20 to 50 pages of investigative details, they were actually finding that they were looking at crimes instead of CRIs. They should have been reclassified at a much earlier stage. The important thing to note is that the local supervisory regime would be that a Detective Sergeant or Detective Inspector would do periodic reviews on these reports in any case, so this should not be going on for weeks and weeks; this should be identified much sooner.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q9 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Otherwise it is not justified to downgrade the crime.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">James Patrick</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Absolutely.

These are the words from the horse’s mouth; this is something that I recorded in a conversation with the Crime Management Unit themselves. These are not my words. They went on to say, “In part the problem is ignorance of the counting rules”. Also, in the Metropolitan Police—this is a side note that came up later—tendentiously they are working to the charging standards, which is well beyond the remit of what we are there to do. We do not do deciding guilt. That is court, that is the justice system. We gather evidence and put it before the justice system. Effectively, we are usurping that in some way by pre-empting it with our own decisions, based on those standards, which is inappropriate.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Within SCD</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">5, which is now renamed as SOECA—it is the unit that deals with child sexual offences predominantly—“The bulk of the issue relating to No Crime,” they say, was “officers not understanding the counting rules”, but “it appears to be the perception that serious sexual offences being undetected is a dirty word, so the preference has developed to try and justify no crime on the basis of MH”—mental health—or similar issues of vulnerability, or by saying that the victim has refused to go on to disclose to them.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q11 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> This </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">would</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> finish up with trying to persuade a victim they were not raped, for example.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">James Patrick</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Effectively</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, yes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Dr Patrick, you are nodding at this.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Rodger Patrick:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes, but not in the “nodding” sense that we have spoken of earlier.

In 2010, the then Assistant Commissioner decided that he wanted to install a new shift pattern predominantly focusing on response teams. In order to do so, they prepared demand profiles, which were based on a number of data factors. Within that, some of the data was </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">based</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> on activity analysis. Activity analysis was a two</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">week dip sample, which police officers used to fill in themselves. It was well known to be a nonsense. We used to get told which codes to tick so that it would not affect the budgets and stuff like that.

Exercises have been run where the historical formula to determine those levels of workforce has been shown to be grossly out of kilter with the real demand, as opposed to the recorded demand. There is a massive disconnect between the reality of what is happening on the ground and the formula that is used to determine an appropriate workforce for a borough.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Ford</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I would like to echo that.

One of the things that police officers use or are encouraged to use to avoid recording is to actually arrest for offences that do not appear in the National Crime Recording Standard. One particular offence that causes a great deal of difficulty is drunk and disorderly offences, which do not appear in the crime stats. There are significant numbers of people who are arrested for those offences. It is a particular cause of concern for lots of communities at the moment, but there is a skewing of the figures, because ordinarily some people would be arrested in those drunk and disorderly figures for offences under the Public Order Act. They are not actually appearing, so that harm is not being managed; it is not being recognised. There is some real vulnerability for society there.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q19 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">Robert</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold"> Halfon:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> With all the things that you have set out as alleged manipulation of the stats, who makes the decisions as to when you get told to do these things?

They want to serve victims properly. Performance culture then takes its toll, inasmuch as some boroughs have their performance capped. They can only afford to have X number of burglaries per day, X number of robberies per week. In the daily meeting, they will discuss individual crimes with a view to seeing what opportunities there are to count them as something other than a priority crime. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Within the system, within each force, there is an individual known as the Force Incident Registrar and the Force Crime Registrar. In some small forces, they are a combined role. In theory, that individual is the final arbiter as to what is and is not a crime and, if it is a crime, what kind of crime it needs to be classified as. I use the expression “in theory” because the vast majority are either overruled by ACPO officers or have their activities nullified by having their teams effectively gated and given something else to do, rather than looking at areas of performance that would qualify or criticise what some would see as good performance. They are moved away to look at something that is not important and, when they find something that is damaging to good performance, they are either ignored or marginalised.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q20 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Robert Halfon:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">When</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> someone says to you, “Right, we have to change this,” or “We are going to do this </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">this</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> way”, where does that order come from and who makes it?

In </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, the targets would start at MOPAC—the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime—so it would be a 20% reduction over the next four years. In that case, that actually arose in error. It was supposed to be a 20% reduction across the eight</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">year</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> term, but the speechwriter got it wrong, so I am led to believe.

By the time you get down to the level of Inspector or Sergeant or PC, that has actually probably become some sort of tightly linked appraisal or part and parcel of the promotion process and assessment. I think David Gilbertson’s written evidence points to this as well—because this has been going on for such a long time now, from the 1990s right up until today, the entire generation of police leadership, including the junior managers, do not know any other way.

That translates to “Record 20% fewer crimes” as far as ACPO and senior officers are concerned. The number of victims remains exactly the same; they just do not get recorded. If they are not recorded as victims, they do not receive any of the victim care that they would if they were any type of victim, but for certain crimes, they receive a prescribed victim care response. If you are a victim of residential burglary or robbery—mugging, as it is usually referred to—there is a prescribed response to that. You get a certain type of victim care package. If your windows have suffered chisel marks four storeys up, and it is quite obviously an attempt at burglary, but it is claimed as criminal damage, you do not receive anything at all.

The reason that this came up in a conversation was that I was at an analyst seminar and the performance analyst from the Mayor’s office was there. I was genuinely asking how the Mayor’s 20% reduction target came about. The reason I asked that was because they </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">were</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> giggling among themselves. They said, “We all know that, by 2015, the only way to achieve these reductions will be by fudging the figures even more”. So I said, “How did this happen?” She said, “Genuinely, the agreement was that the Mayor saw an 11% reduction in his first term and believed that we could achieve a further reduction of 11% in the second term.” When it came to the announcement, instead of it being a 22% reduction across two terms, it was a 20% reduction this term.

When third parties—a witness—reported a crime, the balance of probability standard should have been applied. That was reinterpreted around about 2005, as a result of the national street crime initiative, and the balance of probability standard became applied to all victims, not just witnesses. In effect, we were going back to the old system where a victim had to prove that actually a crime had occurred and they were a victim of it.

We can take that for granted about the confidence of the public, and one hopes that policymakers will now take note of what you have said this morning.

Many people are persuaded that their pocket has not been picked—“Is it possible that you have lost it?”. It goes to the extent that, from experience, the victims of street robbery where violence has been used to take their property from them have been rung back on many occasions to try to persuade them that, in fact, they were mis</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">t</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">aken, no violence was used and it merely slipped from their bag.

They rehearse the issues we have just been describing today. To say they were unaware is farcical.

The other, of course—this is where there is a direct responsibility on Parliament and on Government—is where political pressure is inadvertently causing the sorts of behaviours that we are talking about. As people who have all had experience in different ways, very simply, what are we going to do? What needs to change, both in the political leadership and structures of policing, but also in stamping out the abuse of culture, so that this sort of thing stops happening, and people can actually have confidence in what we are told are the crime figures for this country?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Ford</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We need a broader approach in to what is reported to the public. As I have already said, we should not just focus on national crime recording figures. There is so much that policing manages </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">in</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> terms of risk and in terms of what we deliver for the public.

I know that HMIC is going to be undertaking some work in the new year around inspection regimes in forces. We have the code of ethics that has been announced by the Home Secretary, which is potentially a way forward.

Key things are leadership, culture and changes to systems and processes, with a focus on people, not stats. That is where we lose a lot of our way as a service.

They do not mention the previous two weeks where crime has gone up. We will have some bad weather, and the crime is down, but the next week, the weather is fine and it goes up again.

They were aware of what the national crime recording standard was and they went into police stations to look at the signs that were up saying, “Question people and prevent making false reports”, and took them down. The problem was that the crime recording standard changed its interpretation to a balance of probability, and their ability to audit that was severely limited. It is restricted because of it, because it is so loose. You need to look at that again and go back to victim sovereignty, so that, when somebody reports a crime, it is their right to have it recorded and investigated. If it is found to be false later on, then they can be charged with the offences. It will not affect the crime figures, because there will be another offence recorded; one will come off the books and one will go on. The burglary will come off and the fraud will go on. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q60 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do we not </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">want</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> a police force, whatever the incentives are, where the police say, “I am sorry; I am not going to do that.

You can see why I regard it as both of those things from the evidence you have heard. There is a tremendous job for us, as Police and Crime Commissioners, to do to bring the governance to policing that is really needed. I recognise much in what I have heard, and I have learned some things. It is a subject of great complexity, as I think you have realised this morning. I learned some things this morning, but much of it was familiar to me, not necessarily from what I have found in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Essex</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> now, but from historical anecdotes and indeed from other forces. There was much that I recognised, much to be concerned about and much that is challenging.

There was a lot of focus on the bonus culture. It is worth recalling—I am not in any way trying, and I am not here today, to defend the police, far from it—with the introduction of Winsor, that performance culture has changed radically. Indeed, in some forces including </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Essex</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, not the current but the previous Chief Constable abandoned that bonus culture as he was appointed Chief Constable. Every force is in a different position on this, and it is absolutely right not to generalise.

That was officers chasing targets, you are absolutely right. It was some officers, not all, chasing targets, which was still lawful, but they had lost the victim at the centre of that piece of business.

All of those items in the recovery plan have now come about. We have had our own crime analyst looking, using the same methodology as HMIC did for that report, four times, and absolutely drilling down four times. That is by looking at when the crime comes in, listening when somebody reports a crime and tracking it all the way down to the disposal. That has never been done before. That was the first time HMIC had done that. He has done it four times. That has been done four times since, and it is coming out at between 95% and 98% compliance, which is a difference from the 90% that was the original HMIC.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I do not want to stop your flow, but you are giving a very full answer for us.

There is a better system within the control room, right at the front end, for supervision and provision, and there is better provision when our officers go to speak to victims of crime and then report the crime.

It is important that the Committee recognises the amount of money and amount of work that go into validating crime statistics. The budget in Nottinghamshire for the police is about £200</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">million. The cost of crime management is £1.9</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">million, so there is quite an elaborate structure, with a registrar and people working with him who check the figures through. I have to say, Mr Halfon, I think, as budgets get more difficult, there will be scrutiny of the amount of money spent on checking the checkers. It is a big sum of money to spend.

I am confident that, in the main, reporting in Nottinghamshire is good, but is 92% validation good enough? I am sure it is not. As I said to the Chairman earlier on—and I guess it is an issue for the Committee—Merseyside Police looked at some of the crime recording practices in Nottinghamshire and said, “They are not the same as ours”.

As a result of that, the priorities of the police have been skewed. Laws have been passed that are probably unnecessary. We mentioned knife crime in the previous session. There was a whole new false perception of an increase in knife crime that was not happening. Huge sums of money have been spent chasing shadows. Do you not feel—all three of you—that a fundamental reform is necessary that you as PCCs could carry out, if you are going to justify your existence?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Nick Alston</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I do not think it is a fundamental reform.

I</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">have set up </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">an ethics and integrity committee to try to bring that broader perspective to bear on this topic. The opportunity is there, and we may be under-weighting the importance of having Police and Crime Commissioners who can really bring this debate alive locally and answer these points. In my police and crime plan, I talked about the likelihood in some areas that recorded crime will go up, because we want people to record crimes. We know that areas of crime are under</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">reported</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, so let us have a really honest, open debate—and a local debate, because there will be local variations. I would not want to be thought of as a zealot for reforming, but there is an opportunity for doing things differently and we should take that opportunity, as one of your previous witnesses said.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Ann Barnes</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: My view is quite simple about the crime-recording figures. If the people of this country are to trust the crime recording figures, then we have to be open and transparent about them, because that is the only way you get trust and integrity, and we have to compare like with like. It is a nonsense when you say that crime is going up in one force and down in another, when you do not have a proper baseline for actually saying what the compliance rate with crime recording</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">is. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Kent</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has got that now.

Without exception, Police and Crime Commissioners are trying to put victims first, giving them more focus. You are absolutely right to say that we have to ensure that people have confidence in the crime statistics. Have they at the moment? No, they have not. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Ann Barnes</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The interesting thing, as well, is that we have introduced in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Kent</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> two appeals processes, which were never there before.

There can be a discussion about how much unreported crime there is. You asked directly, Chairman, whether crime was going up because reporting has been better since 1</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">April. I am not going to make political points but, when police forces are losing officers, and all of them have, and when austerity measures are beginning to rise, those are other factors too.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Nick Alston</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Chairman, I have two or three points. Firstly, the crime survey for </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Wales</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, as we said earlier, will show broadly what has happened in terms of the real levels of crime. The fact that recorded crime has been falling more steeply does suggest to me there has been under</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">recording</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. You will see a wide variation across forces. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Essex</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, for example, in the last two or three years, has been one of the most poorly performing forces if you look at the rate of crime reduction. Crime was falling in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Essex</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, but at a recorded rate that was much lower than elsewhere. I am pleased to say that, from April to date, it has continued to fall in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Essex</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. That may be because, over the last two or three years, crime recording has got tighter and better. I am not sure. The factors driving apparent crime reduction now, or crime going up when it does, are very complex, so I do not think there is a simple answer.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q134 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You draw the all</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">important point, which is that recorded crime was, for quite a period, falling faster than the crime survey. As the ONS has said, declining standards of NCRS compliance may be a possible driver of this divergence. You would all agree with that. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paddy Tipping</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think the important point is “may be”, because they have not come to a judgment on this. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Ann Barnes</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There are many reasons why crime rises or falls. One of them in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Kent</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is that we do have a big push on visible community policing. We are doing predictive policing, predicting where crimes might happen and placing officers there. We have a fleet of mobile police stations out and about in town centres, finding more crime. By being more visible, which is one of my manifesto pledges—I want our officers on our streets working with local people—they are actually finding more crime as well. I suppose in a way we are a victim of our own success, in many respects.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q135 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> On that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">happy</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> note, unless there are any other further questions or any further comments that you wish to add, may I thank you?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Nick Alston</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Chairman, can I just say something very briefly? Do be careful about the question you ask. We are talking about crimes where there are victims. There are many victimless crimes—all the crimes against society, all the drug offences. You need to look not only at the victim crimes, but also where there are no victims, when you are looking at the data. Police forces can go out and arrest lots of people who may be carrying drugs, and they will then impact the crime data very significantly. It will put crime up; it might put the detection rates up as well. There is a level of sophistication and complexity here, which is quite challenging.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paddy Tipping</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Just to add briefly, Chairman, one of the things the Committee might look at is the notion of cybercrime, because crime is occurring, but no one really knows what the source of that crime is and how it should be recorded, in which authority and in which country.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Understood.
