The services which local government procures are many and varied ranging from direct services such as housing, and the collection of household waste; more personal services such as social care services for children, older people and people with disabilities; and the buying in of day-to-day goods or products such as IT and stationary. Increasingly procurement activity is carried out across agencies especially with health services or other local councils. Local councillors through their involvement in Local Commissioning Groups control significant health and local government expenditure. New responsibilities for public health give local government responsibilities to procure preventative services. Increasingly public bodies are urged to pool their resources and to undertake joint activity in order achieve value for money for local communities.</span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; line-height:18pt; margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 32.17pt; orphans:0; padding-left:3.83pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">For many people procurement decisions can have a major impact on their daily lives and their quality of life. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The services provided can be both essential and services for which the individual has little or no choice in the provider. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">In addition, when procuring care services councils are urged to ensure more personal services are delivered tailored to individual needs.

The report argues that ethical standards are important and that they are particularly important where public money is being spent on public services or public functions.  Society can expect better outcomes when decisions are made fairly and on merit and not influenced by personal and private interests.  Organisations in every sector benefit </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">from greater legitimacy when the public has confidence in their integrity.  The UK economy benefits nationally and internationally from that confidence.  </span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; line-height:18pt; margin:0pt 0pt 9pt 32.17pt; orphans:0; padding-left:3.83pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The report highlights the most important of the current risks to ethical standards in public life. One significant risk identified in the report stems from the introduction of a wide range of new ways of delivering public services, currently being driven by a combination of political philosophy and economic pressure. These include clinical commissioning groups, elected mayors and police and crime commissioners, academy schools and private, voluntary sector, mutual or citizen-led provision in areas ranging from prisons to hospitals, social housing and </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">libraries.  Some of these new roles and methods of service delivery will entail services being delivered</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> by people not previously involved in public service</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">or being faced with different demands and challenges. It is essential however public services are delivered, governance structures are designed which actively promote the right ethical behaviour. Local government procurement and contracting should take account of and manage the risk to ethical standards when considering changes to the way in which a service is delivered.

Findings suggest that respondents support the use of external scrutiny and audit mechanisms and the development of a strong internal culture fostering standards and openness as means for improving professional integrity and increasing confidence in public institutions.
