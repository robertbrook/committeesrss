font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Governor and team from the FPC, thank you very much for coming to see us this afternoon. Can I begin by asking you, Governor, a couple of questions on the topical subjects that are knocking around at the moment on bank restructuring and on remuneration in banks? On the issue of restructuring—that is, the case for capping market share or balance sheet size in order to improve competition—the Vickers Commission did quite a bit of work on this and they came to the conclusion that neither approach was appropriate. You have come new to this, although you might have some Canadian experience to bring to bear. Have you had a chance to examine what John Vickers said in all this and what do you think?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Carney</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: Thank you, Chair and members. In terms of my recollection of what the Vickers Commission said on this subject, I think the points they raised with which I would agree, or at least the ones I retained, let us put it that way—and I only retain the ones I agree with—that a sort of simple approach that caps size or, in the specific case they looked at, a specific number of branches that were going to be potentially disposed </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">of </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">and ultimately were or are in the process of being, you need to look at the entire package of the institution. What is the actual business model? What goes with the liabilities, i.e. the deposits and others that come with the branches? What is the asset </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">structure with the loans? Where are loans to deposits? What is the risk structure as a consequence of that? What are the Treasury operations that go with that? What is the risk management? What is the strategic objective?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Then also—and this gets into higher order questions of effective competition, which Sir John Vickers is very well placed to comment upon given his extensive expertise—just breaking up an institution does not necessarily create a more intensive competitive structure, and so relevant competition authorities need to look at it. I will make that general point, which is that it is not just about one aspect. You need to look at the entire business model and the risk profile and certainly, whether it is the PRA or more broadly the FPC, we would look at that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">I make a separate point from my experience, which is more international than Canadian, which is that in the </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> there is a hard cap on deposits. You can’t have more than 10% of the deposit share in the </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> and that is a rule that has been in place for—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> That is Dodd-Frank, is it?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Carney</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: It is a rule that has been in place for decades, so well precedes, obviously, Dodd-Frank. One of the points I would make from a Financial Policy Committee perspective is that obviously that rule, in and of itself, did not prevent the creation of large systemic financial institutions. In fact, one could argue a bit—but I would not overstate this—that, by limiting the absolute funding for certain large institutions—in other words, they cannot go above that 10% deposit cap—it encouraged on the margin more wholesale funding for expanding balance sheets, which created a risk in and of itself. So we have to look at this in the round. I will finish here. As this Committee is well aware, in part through this Committee’s work and work through the PCBS, we now have a secondary remit at the PRA to have regard to competition with respect to regulation in our actions.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> We had to work very hard to get it there, but I am glad we have.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Carney</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: But it is there and we will discharge it, yes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q2 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> The Vickers Commission, concluded, “Capping market share and balance sheet size would not result in substantial improvements to competition in retail banking in the </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">.” Do you agree with that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Carney</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: I certainly have no reason to disagree with the conclusions of the Vickers Commission.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q3 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> A cautious man, but I have the general gist.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">On the bonus cap, the Parliamentary Commission—and there are a couple of members of it here now—looked at the EU bonus cap and we concluded, “We are not convinced that a crude bonus cap is the right instrument for controlling pay.

Are you entirely happy with the </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Basel</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">—no, you are not. There was a definite twitch even before I completed the word “happy”. Perhaps you could tell me what it is about </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Basel</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> that you think would merit a bit of improvement.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Carney</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: If I may answer the question directly, I would say we are satisfied with the </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Basel</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> agreement. Let me go through the positives and I will highlight one or two issues. The first reason why we are absolutely satisfied is we now have a global</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">ly</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> agreed standard for leverage, so it takes away the uncertainty for a leverage ratio. I will not go into all the reasons why a leverage ratio is important, unless people want me to, but we have a globally agreed standard. It takes away that definitional uncertainty, assuming that it is applied appropriately in the relative jurisdictions that we all watch. That is the first point.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">The second point is we have a stricter definition than the definition that we were applying here in the </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> and that was in CRD IV. It is stricter in terms of its treatment of credit derivatives as one example, and it is also stricter in terms of its treatment of securities financing transactions, so those are material </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">tightenings</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">The third reason to be satisfied is that there are sensible adjustments to this definition that will help the system function better. I will give you a couple of examples.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> They are not get-outs?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Carney</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: They are not get-outs. These are sensible things. I will give you the examples and hopefully you will agree with it. First is that there is now the ability to net cash margin against derivative positions, both initial and variable. If you have cash in hand against an exposure, you can net that off against the exposure. This is exactly what we want to happen in the market—that there is more posting of cash, more posting of margin against these exposures, and it reinforces that behaviour. Since it is cash in hand, not securities that are treated as cash, it is a sensible adjustment. That is the first thing.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">The second thing is that there is on-boarding—bringing on balance sheet off-balance sheet exposures—and it uses the standardised approach. I should start with everything that is on balance sheet. Everything that is on balance</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> sheet is there in the leverage</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> ratio. Nothing is taken away. There are always arguments around the fringes and I would say going into this past weekend our concern was that there would be some success in stating that a certain asset is risk-free and, therefore, the one next to it is slightly, almost risk-free and so on and gradually you lose the great advantage of a leveraged ratio, which is simplicity. Everything on balance sheet is there. Another advantage is it is accounting neutral, so the treatment of it is neutral to the small—in some cases larger—differences between US GAAP and international GAAP.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">It also brings on to balance sheet off-balance sheet factors and here is where the compromise is. This is part of the slightly unhappy—or accepting as part of a compromise. It uses what is the standardised approach in </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Basel</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> for the risk of those off-balance sheet items, so a certain risk is applied to a back-up liquidity line and it uses that percentage. It is the one case where there is the use of a risk weighting to bring things that are off balance sheet on to balance sheet—contingent exposures. One of the reasons why we were happy with that is we received the other </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">tightenings</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> as part of the agreement in exchange for that and </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">relatedly</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">, as part of using that approach, we had a much more sensible approach to trade finance exposures. It was punitive to trade finance exposures, which are contingent exposures, and that proved to be problematic during the course of the crisis and in the immediate aftermath of the crisis, so this again is a sensible adjustment.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q5 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> You are going to fully implement all this?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Carney</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: Our intention is to fully implement it.

What was agreed in </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Basel</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> was the definition and additional disclosure around that definition, so you could adjust all those things I just referenced by additional disclosure that banks were going to make. If you did not like the definition as an investor or a lender to a bank, you could make adjustments in their prescribed disclosure, but what was agreed was that banks will have to report in Basel at a minimum from 2015—in the UK it will be sooner than this—and then in 2017 there will be a decision of the Basel Committee about making this a formal pillar 1 requirement. Somewhere between now and then there will be calibration. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Because we have used this number internationally, the presumption is that it will be at least 3%.

As I have indicated in the past, my personal—and I am not speaking for the Committee—inclination is that we would not jack up but gross up whatever the base level is for ring-fenced banks and for systemic banks in order to ensure that the leverage ratio fully performs its function.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q7 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> There was something of a rally in banking stocks after this announcement, suggesting they thought things were going to be worse.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Carney</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: There was a rally, yes.

In UK bank stocks it was a very modest adjustment on the course of the day, which can be consistent with the way we have been applying leverage and the fact that this is a slight tightening.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q8 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Do you get the impression, as was reported in various places, that the banks were all over those taking the decision and that they—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Carney</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: No, not at all. I think the banks were totally in the dark about what was going to be decided. As Chairman of the FSB, I am pretty confident about that. We had a consultation process as the Basel Committee, as we should have. I think the adjustments we made were sensible adjustments and I will stress that netting off of cash margin is a sensible adjustment. It is good for the derivative market and it reduces risk. The other adjustment we made, which is slightly arcane and complex, was an adjustment for the margin that banks hold when they clear on behalf of other clients through a central counterparty clearing arrangement. That is something that again reduces systemic risk because it promotes central clearing of counterparties. Those are the types of changes that we were able to make as a result of the consultation, but they were not the types of changes that institutions had any reason to expect that we necessarily would have made.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q9 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Ruffley</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Eligibility of mortgage lending—FLS.

Thank you for the question. We looked at a range of indicators in terms of the absolute levels of mortgages, both fixed and variable, the survey measures of the availability, and bank level data in terms of mortgage applications and mortgage lending. There has been a marked improvement. We also looked, for part of the broader consideration, at the overall change in bank funding costs in wholesale markets because, as you will recall, one of the original motivations of Funding for Lending was exactly to help reduce the funding costs of banks in the whole in order to promote lending both to the mortgage and the commercial sector.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q10 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Ruffley</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> The mortgage lending withdrawal was in relation to the FLS extension and the additional allowance.

If you earned an allowance through mortgage lending in the past, you retain that allowance and you can use that allowance over the life of the scheme, which runs through the course of next year. However, you cannot earn, as you well know, those additional allowances.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">If I could put it in some context in the mortgage market, the analogy was taking our foot off the accelerator, not putting our foot on the brake, in terms of this change because our sense was—given where mortgage lending was likely to go, various scenarios for mortgage lending over the course of 2014 and the additional allowances that could be earned as a consequence of that—that it could provide an additional reduction in mortgage rates through lower funding costs of, I would say, up to 30 basis points. Mortgage rates have come down by a couple of hundred basis points as funding has come down, but an additional amount was, in our view, just not necessary at a time when mortgages are growing in high single digits at very competitive rates.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q11 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Ruffley</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Is there a sense that this existing relief will be unwound at some future date, and if so, when?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Carney</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: The scheme itself runs out at the end of this year.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q12 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Ruffley</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Is there a sense that, when it does expire, the commercial lenders might hit a brick wall?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Carney</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: I would say no for two main reasons. First, our observations of funding conditions for commercial lenders are very strong. Secondly, for the FLS to be consistent with its original spirit, which was to get funding costs down from extreme levels and support the funding market—it would become a backstop-type facility, so something that banks would draw on in the event that there were disruptions to funding markets. We have changed the way we supply liquidity to the system as a whole. There is a new sterling market framework and, in that sterling market framework, the banks can use mortgages and, in fact, a much broader range of collateral to collateralise, in any sort of distressed market condition, quite cost-effective funding from the Bank of England. We still provide the backstop, but we provide it on a much more coherent, comprehensive and permanent basis.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q13 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Ruffley</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Is there any sense that you might have to have tapering provisions at all?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Carney</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: No.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q14 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Ruffley</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> My colleague, Mrs Pearce, will be asking about house prices but before she asks those questions, Governor, could you just reflect on the credit conditions survey?

Obviously the survey came into being just as credit demand was at a peak and then it very sharply fell off. We are still in a position, as I think you are aware, that mortgage applications, mortgage transactions and housing transactions, for that matter, are running, on average, at about three quarters of the pre-crisis average levels. We have had an acceleration from quite a low level. As a Committee, obviously in all aspects of the housing market and certainly any time we see sharp increases in credit growth, we take an interest. We are monitoring this closely because it is the question of the momentum that is there and the length of time that it is sustained. We do have to put it some context, though—that it is running still below historic averages.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Ruffley</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> What do you think is driving it?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Carney</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: Housing activity.

Very importantly, one of the things this Committee has been very focused on, as has the PRA, has been: will further sustained high single-digit or even low double-digit growth in mortgage activity be accompanied, and could it only be accompanied by a deterioration in underwriting standards? We do not want to see that because that is the type of behaviour that obviously reduces the resilience of the system as a whole and feeds potentially extrapolative dynamics in the housing market, which is a risk that we are monitoring closely.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q15 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Ruffley</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> A final question.

We do not have an FPC forecast of house prices. We do have an MPC analysis of potential ranges of house prices. We do not give a point forecast, but our general expectation has been for a continuation of current momentum, house price momentum and mortgage activity and credit growth momentum into 2014 before decelerating around the middle of 2015, towards 2016, towards growth in terms of debt; so total household debt more approximating the rate of growth of incomes.

There has been very little home building here relative to desired household formation for a long period of time, and that was exacerbated since the start of the crisis where was a sharp fall-off in home building. Thirdly, as the financial sector has started to recover and fulfil its function there has been a change in mortgage availability, but it has not been complete because one of the dynamics we see in terms of house prices—and this is true across the United Kingdom—is that there has been more movement in higher-price house prices for a given region. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">If you look at the upper quartile of house prices, those have increased more than those cheaper houses in relative terms.

It has been tougher to get mortgages if you are an entrant to the housing market.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q19 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Teresa Pearce:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Yet in </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">, where house prices are vastly increasing, a large percentage of purchases of properties are cash purchases.

In value terms, these are big numbers in </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">. In volume terms—so percentage of transactions—these are low single-digit numbers in terms of actual numbers of houses. Again, from a financial stability perspective, where is the risk? First, the risk, of course, is what is happening across the </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">United Kingdom</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">. Secondly, it is where people are borrowing as opposed to paying cash.

It is not one single factor that produces the situation you now have. I think the underlying issue is an imbalance between supply and demand in housing in the areas that people want or need to live. That has been the </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> issue for as long as I can remember.

There is an underlying problem of supply and demand and that has been with us for a long time. I think what you see now is that the market was depressed.

As to what the problem is, I think the thing that one takes note of is the speed of the increase in house prices.

As Sir Jon intimated, in the areas where people either want to live or have to live, there just is not that order of magnitude of supply and it gives one a sense at least of the scale of the issue.

If there are extrapolative expectations of individuals and, very importantly, if that is accompanied by the expectations of lenders—in other words, if a lender is lending to an individual basically on the assumption that the risk is very low because the value of the underlying asset of the house is going to continue to go up, so as the lender I do not do a very good job of checking your ability to pay and I am willing to lend a very high proportion of the current value of the house because I expect it to continue to go up. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">It has been that deterioration in underwriting standards, whether it was in the </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">United States</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">, whether it was in </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Sweden</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> in the early 1990s or whether it was here at times in the last decade—it is that type of behaviour that drives the last bubble-like phase of the housing market and creates the financial stability problem. That is why the mortgage market review terms are coming into force in April of this year. That is why we are conducting stress tests, as both the FPC and the PRA, of the banks. That is why we are looking to have affordability tests as well, to stop this type of behaviour in its tracks.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">I will finish with this.

Under the Help to Buy scheme, where people are given larger mortgages than they would have received normally, should house prices drop because supply increases—and possibly house prices will come down—the risk does not fall on the lender. The risk falls on the taxpayer because, if there is a negative equity or a person cannot pay, the bank or whoever lent the money gets their money first and the taxpayer loses their money. You have to be even more careful to make sure that when they are lending, when they are not bearing the risk, they adhere to those sensible policies that you have just outlined. Do you have to be even more rigorous with Help to Buy loans than we have with ordinary loans?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Carney</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: Lenders have to be rigorous with Help to Buy loans. Lenders have to apply those mortgage market regulation standards from the start of the Help to Buy programme, so they do not wait until April. Those are already in place. They also take the first exposure before the taxpayer does.</span><a name="_ftnref1"></a><a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> The structure of it has a so-called vertical slice, if you will, of exposure that goes to the bank lender, but it is not the scale of the mortgage. You are absolutely right that the core of it is providing the additional insurance to reduce the effect of loan to value. The underwriting standards have to be there. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Now, the programme thus far, to my information, is about 6,000 applications and about 750 mortgages that have been written. They are mostly 95% loan to value, so high loan to value mortgages. The loan to income stats or one of the measures of the creditworthiness of the borrower are not elevated relative to other first-time buyers and the actual value of the properties are around the median and slightly below the median value of a property in the UK.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">I will finish with this. From a Financial Policy Committee perspective, any evaluation of Help to Buy would be in the context of what impact it could have on the mortgage market in general and risk to financial stability in general.

It included things we are doing that are already in train and some additional measures that we are doing this year, including stress tests, the funding for lending adjustment that is there and others.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Loan to value and loan to income tools have been used in other jurisdictions for macro-prudential purposes. There are a variety of variants, but they would include an absolute cap on loan to value. By shifting that cap from 95% loan to value, which is the upper end at present in the </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">, to something lower effectively is a quantity restriction in terms of lending in the market. A similar loan to income type measure would have a similar effect.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">If I can put it in these terms, there is an important consideration in terms of stock and flow. With loan to value you have a stock question; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">to put it in everyday terms, a question of </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">downpayment</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">. If you drop the loan to value ratio, if you have some cap that is lower, people have to save longer for a </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">downpayment</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">. Is that the best route if they can afford to continue to service the mortgage? The advantage of the loan to income, appropriately used, is it focuses on affordability and the ability to continue to service. One of the things that we are exploring with the FCA is to focus on affordability and create a new tool that we think has some promise, which is to change the qualifying interest rate or the interest rate that banks use in order to assess that affordability.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q28 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Stewart </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Hosie</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Setting aside the specific detail of the tool for a moment, given that your role is macroeconomic stability, what conditions would need to be met before you would consider invoking such a tool?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Carney:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> We would have to see broad-based momentum in the housing market with the prospect of it persisting, and associated rates of credit growth that increased risk to financial stability, including analysis of cohorts of </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">borrowers</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">—so by different ability to service borrowing over time.

The interim FPC in March 2012 said it did not yet want to be given loan to value or loan to income tools as they lacked public acceptability.

I think in this we did not go back into that question about whether Parliament should give the FPC directive powers. It is much more a question of what sort of instruments within the set that we have, including recommendations, we could use. I have to say I think the recommendation tools—my guess, as we have not used this—are quite powerful, particularly “comply or explain”, before you get to this question of whether the Committee should have directive powers.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q31 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Stewart </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Hosie</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> That is quite helpful.

The FPC record notes that it was possible that any decision by the FPC to raise the MMR stress test interest rate in the future might encourage borrowers to switch to mortgage products with fixed interest rates rather than floating rates. Would that be a good outcome or not?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Richard Sharp</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: Earlier we were discussing the question of individuals exposed to risk as a result of house purchases at the margin; obviously a very important cohort, as described by the Governor. One of the risks associated with that and making purchases at increasingly elevated prices is the affordability. The affordability is clearly also a function, if they do not lock in the interest rates, of a real risk exposed to rising interest rates. Therefore, it is axiomatic that the risk is reduced if the affordability criterion is based upon a fixed interest rate. Certainly, the structure in the </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> would have lower risk associated with the housing market if more mortgages were fixed and fixed for longer.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q34 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Newmark</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> That seems to be more the American model.

In that sense, the individuals in this nation have benefited from being short of the curve going down the interest rate spectrum. For practical purposes we are now close to zero-rate bound, so you also have to make a judgment about the future. Certainly, my judgment would be, this would be a good time. Now, the </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> problems </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">on </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> housing were not to do with the structure of the interest rates.

The issue then is the source of their liquidity and the funding in relati</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">on to the duration of the assets</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">. That remains constant—them extending variable 20-year mortgages. That is still a 20-year asset they hold.

Prospective servicing ability, which </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">goes back to the exchange you just had with Mr Sharp, is important.

Where do you see things moving and possibly having an impact? The reason why I am asking all this is that, as Mr Sharp said, many people have benefited from a yield curve that effectively has continued to drop.

If we take the interest rate point in isolation, it is one of the reasons why it makes sense—and disciplined lenders are doing this already—to look at a household’s ability to service a mortgage, not just at the current 2.2% best floating rate or the two-year fixed rate on a mortgage but where that rate could be five or seven years out and under various income scenarios. It is why we are looking more closely at so-called micro data or cohort-level data, and we will be reporting on them in subsequent financial stability reports—basically the quintiles of borrowers by type, in terms of debt servicing ability, how those are shifting and how they would further shift in higher interest rate scenarios.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q39 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Newmark</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> You touch on two separate issues.

The matching of those assets and liabilities is, as you would expect, far from perfect. Basically, those assets are seldom available to help service those liabilities.

For early, first-time buyers in the south-east we have that. Within the Bank of England writ large we are the regulator of all the mortgage lenders in the </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">United Kingdom</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">. We have access to additional data and perspective</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">s</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> from those institutions. One of the strategic priorities we have as an institution is to make better use of the potential synergies of that data, which is there for micro-prudential regulatory purposes. One of the things we ask ourselves is how we can better use that data to anticipate macro trends, both for financial stability and—not the purpose of today—also for monetary policy purposes. That is one of the potentials of the structure that this Committee and Parliament has put in place.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q40 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Newmark</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> I guess my real concern, having lived through the 1980s and the 1990s and seen a lot of people get pulled into a market for a whole variety of reasons, is that we have had for some time now very low interest rates. People have almost forgotten what it was like when interest rates were double digit and some people’s mortgages were double digit. Do you think households have become too used to low interest rates? Do you see that as problematic?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Carney:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Well, a couple of things. One is that the MPC will set monetary policy in a way that is consistent with low, stable, predictable inflation or inflation target at all times. We are certainly not anticipating some dramatic adjustment to levels of rates, but when we sit here as the Financial Policy Committee your question is on point, in that we need to ensure that lenders and households—and households are the first line of defence; they are the ones taking out the mortgages—</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">consider their ability to service their mortgages, retain their homes is what we are talking about, in more adverse, higher interest rate scenarios. That is one of the reasons why we are working with the FCA to create this tool, which is a qualifying interest rate. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">I do not think you are confused about this but just to make sure anyone watching is not, this is something that would be used to assess affordability. It is not the actual rate that somebody would pay, but it goes directly to your point, which is to say, “What if interest rates were at X number?”, a number that would be set by the FPC in order to assess the ability to service that mortgage through the cycle.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q41 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Newmark</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> I guess it is not just the affordability issue. There is another impact, which is that psychologically if people see house prices going up they feel wealthier and they tend to spend more money. If you raised interest rates by 200 basis points, psychologically that is going to have an impact because people who are used to paying X are now going to be having to pay X plus 200 basis points multiplied by whatever. Do you see that having an impact? We are seeing a return to growth now and the Office for Budget Responsibility has now increased where growth expectations are for this year, next year and beyond. If you suddenly increased interest rates by 200 basis points—I am just pulling a figure out of the air, but that would normalise it to where it has been historically at least—would that have an impact on that growth trajectory or do you see that as not a big risk?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Carney:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> There is a very fundamental point, which is that—and I am afraid we are straying into monetary policy—any decision to change monetary policy has to take into account the impact of that on growth, the utilisation of resources and the impact as a consequence on inflation. If it is a self-defeating change—in other words, it is one that then causes the cessation of the pressures—then it is </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">mis</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">-calibrated. From a financial stability perspective, though, it is not what we think is the most likely scenario. We have to look at, what if this happened? Your 200, 300, 400, 500 basis points example, a range of things like that, is what we do have to look at in order to assess what the risk would be to financial stability if for whatever reason this scenario were to transpire. Have we taken adequate precautions? Has the system taken adequate precautions? If not, what is the most proportionate, targeted and prudent response to that and, with respect to housing, from a menu of a very broad range of tools to which we have access?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q42 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jesse Norman:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Governor, I apologise for being late to join this.

There have been substantial changes to the structure. First up, from our perspective, from the perspective of the FPC, from a prudential perspective and from a system-wide risk perspective what we are most focused on is the structure of compensation, not the level. It is the structure of compensation. The mistakes in compensation from a financial stability perspective, from a prudential perspective—and there were many mistakes—in advance of the crisis related to, in effect, the immediate payment of cash compensation for activities that left risks in terms of actual risk, whether they were credit risks or liability risks or, shamefully, conduct risks, misconduct to be more precise, that remained with the institution for years and hit the institution.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">From </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">2008, in</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> various guises, Sir Jon and I were involved in this development internationally that put in place the initial framework to change the structure of compensation so that there was a much greater emphasis on deferred compensation and equity compensation and the ability to take back compensation if risks crystallised. The </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">, to my memory, was if not the first then one of the first to take those rules and map them into a remuneration code, in 2009. That code was strengthened with European CRD III legislation in 2010. We intend to consult to do two things potentially this year. The PRA will consult on this, but potentially to lengthen the deferral process so that the deferral of compensation is longer than five years. It is not just a question of the ability to claw back deferred compensation if risks come to light, but you can claw back from past compensation that is paid as well.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q43 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jesse Norman:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Just briefly, Governor, is our regime soft touch, medium touch or hard touch at the moment by international standards?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Carney:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> I would say that the regime, as it has been practised in the </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">, is hard touch from a financial stability perspective. A concern, which I know Andrew Bailey at the PRA and I certainly share, with the CRD IV compensation rules is that it takes back some of the advantages of the approach that we have had because it will incentivise more cash compensation today—exactly the type of problem we had before—that we cannot claw back. We would rather see more deferral, more equity, and this ability to take it back when those risks come to light.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q44 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jesse Norman:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> That is helpful.

There are a couple of areas, some of which are in train and we will look to reinforce. Let me say something first. I think what the PRA needs to do, having been given this statutory responsibility by Parliament, is review its approach and prioritise how it gives life to fulfilling that. That is a review, I would suggest, that we would conduct under the oversight of the Oversight Committee of Court first and foremost. We would obviously report to Parliament directly through this Committee and other formats. We will need to add resources, so we are in a budgeting round right now to look at additional people that we would bring in or dedicate to this issue.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Then we would look in areas where our current activities are intended to be pro-competitive and promote competition. One of the areas that we have focused on and we should reinforce is the ease of entry into </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">the banking sector. We have streamlined our processes. How well is that working? We certainly have an increasing number of applications, but how well is that working? We have easier—maybe not the best adjective—liquidity rules and capital rules in the initial three to five years of life of the new institution, again for ease of entry. We are strongly of the view that ease of exit also facilitates ease of entry because I think there needs to be a shared understanding of everybody—but certainly the people in this room, current and future—that there will be failures of institutions. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Orderly failures of institutions are a good thing because it is pro-competitive. If we are charged with operating a zero failure regime then we will not have a competitive regime because everything will be gold-plated and safe. We have those aspects, and then, more broadly, we need to have due regard with new regulations. Whether it is in the capital framework, liquidity framework, “too big to fail”, other derivatives, other aspects of our regime—what is the impact on competition?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q53 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr McFadden:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> I am just trying to be clear about what the problem is that you would be trying to resolve through everything that you have outlined there.

I do not want to give a blanket “all competition is necessarily good”, particularly sitting here today as a member of the Financial Policy Committee.

You mentioned exit as well as entry. You have a very broad international perspective on all the regulatory and other measures taken since the crisis and there have been a lot of them. We do not need to list them here, but there has been a lot of stuff. Not for the first time today to quote your colleague, Mr Haldane, he said, “There is plainly a significant degree of unfinished business here.” Could you just tell us your view on resolving this? It would be quite fair if consumers looked at everything done on ring-fencing and culture and individual responsibility both in this country and abroad and if it has not resolved the question of “too big to fail”, then isn’t that something of an indictment of what has been done so far? If that is the case, if Mr Haldane is right, what more needs to be done to resolve this and to get the taxpayer out of the dilemma that they found themselves in five or six years ago?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Carney:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> We are absolutely clear, both as an institution and internationally, that we have not yet resolved “too big to fail”. We have not yet ended “too big to fail”. The objective of 2014 within the G20 is to make the final major international decisions and agreements that will unlock the international component of ending “too big to fail”. Sir Jon and I happily gave up our Sunday and Monday for a series of discussions not just about the leverage ratio, which we will set aside for this purpose, but with international colleagues on something called “gone concern, loss-absorbing capacity”—bail-in-able debt; in effect, the ability to bail in—which is absolutely essential to unlocking this. It was very productive. We set out the timetable that is consistent with </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Brisbane</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">. We set out all the issues and agreed all the issues internationally. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">What we are effectively trying to do is give life not just to—within Europe and, most importantly, the </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">—the RRD, the recovery and resolution directive, but ensure that it is internationalised. If it is not internationalised, or that approach is not internationalised, then any of these international banks cannot be responsibly resolved without that recourse. That is absolutely a clear objective. We have to get agreement on quantum, location, type or components of this gone concern, loss-absorbing capacity this year in order to unlock this. We have to get some restructuring of how derivative markets work so that you can have stays in derivative markets of collateral. It is a very </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">important technical issue, if we had to resolve one of these without taxpayer reliance. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">What we are also doing internationally—and obviously domestically, but what is relevant internationally for these purposes—is we are going through the resolution plans of all these major institutions, not just in the UK but with the Americans and with the other major centres, to make sure that in our view they work and, if they do not work, what we have to change about them.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">The last thing I will say is on Vickers’ ring-fencing. Yes, that is part of making this work, but I do not think we should forget that it is something that has been agreed. It has gone into legislation and now it has to be implemented. We will not sit here, and you would not want us for a second to do it, and tell you, “Oh, yes, we have all the components.” I can tell you that we have all the components to do this, but they have to be implemented and they have to be agreed.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q57 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr McFadden:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> When can you look the consumer in the eye and say, “We have resolved this and the next time a big bank falls over we will not have to come to you”?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Carney:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> I think that by the end of this year we should have a proposal on the GLAC that will indicate the ability to do this or not.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr McFadden:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> By the end of the year?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Carney:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> That is the objective, by </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">Brisbane</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">.

I chair another Committee, which was sitting. Dame Clara, can I very quickly follow up with you the conversation that we had at your appointment hearing? You will remember that we expressed quite a lot of concern about the fact that you did not seem to be aware of the need, or our feeling that there was a need, for external members to show considerable independence both from the Treasury and the Bank. Having now been an external member for some while, do you understand our concerns?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dame Clara </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Furse</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: I certainly do understand your concerns and I am very sorry, indeed, that I gave the wrong impression because I think it is extremely important that the Committee is independent and is seen to be independent. I think I certainly have a reputation for being independent, which is partly why I was surprised by the questioning on this. Yes, I absolutely agree that it is extremely important.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q59 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">John </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Thurso</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Part of the concern, if I can invite you to perhaps respond a little bit further, is not only that the Committee is seen to be independent but that individual members are seen to be independent. One of the things that we observe and appreciate about the external members of the Monetary Policy Committee is, for example, their habit of going around making speeches which make it very clear that there are differences of opinion that are resolved within the Committee process. That is exactly what we want to see, that robust bringing of independent views. You have not had a chance to make any speeches yet, but do you see that as something that you would like to do to show us that you are individually independent as well as collectively independent?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dame Clara </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Furse</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: Yes, and I am very much looking forward to doing that.

I do completely agree that, particularly because the Financial Policy Committee is not an elected body and does have very great powers, it is extremely important that its members are seen not just to communicate actively with industry, with business and with the market, but are able to explain what the Committee does and how it does it, and the fact that it does so in a context where there is very good discussion and where independent members bring their expertise to bear.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">John </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Thurso</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> I will look forward to listening to you.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q60 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> Those are helpful replies. It is extremely important for the accountability of the FPC that the independents, as they are called, should perform this role. Have you made any speeches yet, Mr Sharp?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Richard Sharp</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">: No. I was quite interested in the way you framed that question. Performing the role as an independent member is of absolutely critical importance, as I say, in relation to one of the things you were concerned about in the past, which was the groupthink and in some sense being dominated by the Executive, and also that we can make judgments that affect macro-prudential supervision and, therefore, affect the economy—that we make them with respect to the sole goal of financial stability.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">I have deliberately not made any speeches because, first of all, I have wanted to gauge, through my own attending of the meetings, the subjects that we discuss and how we discuss them and also because I have a very acute sensitivity to the fact that some of the things that we are discussing have some elements of market sensitivity associated with them. What I have done is discussed with the Governor the development of a communication strategy. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">As you no doubt know, the Chancellor in his remit to us asked us to make sure that our communications were fully coordinated. Differences in nuances can also in themselves create some instability. There is a skill in both demonstrating independence but also making sure that the FPC is seen to be coherent and stable, and not supplying different nuances associated with the same policies to too great a degree. This is an area, as I said when we met, of some discomfort for me but one I intend to tread into because I respect your desire to see members of the FPC engaging with the public. However, I will do so very carefully.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q61 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt"> One of the things that has been of huge benefit to an understanding of monetary policy in this country has been the fact that MPC independents do speak up. They do not always say the same thing by any means, and people are expected to be mature and sensible in listening to this stuff to work out what the overall balance of the MPC is on those extremely sensitive issues, ones that can move markets very quickly. We are not looking for the removal of nuance. We are looking for the expression of genuine views and I very much hope that is what we are going to see in the months and years ahead as the FPC develops.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt">I have one slightly left-field question for you to end with, Governor—I am hoping we can finish before 4pm because there will be a vote—which you may or may not be aware of, which was brought to my attention by a journalist.
