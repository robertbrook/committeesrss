As we have taken evidence in this short inquiry, I still remain a little unclear about the difference between Foresight and crystal ball gazing. We are struggling to get clear definitions here. Perhaps there are different vested interests in this space.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It has been suggested that the Foresight written reports, Sir Mark, take too long to prepare and that the policy agenda has sometimes moved on by the time that they are published. Do you agree with that? If so, what will you do to improve it?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Mark </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Walport</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> In my last session, I talked about the Future Cities Foresight programme, which has just kicked off. I indicated that as part of that we were going to have intermediate end points. You can deduce from that, I think, that the model of two years of work followed by a single output could be improved, so we are moving to do that: we will not have a single, monolithic end point. We will have outputs during the process, and the process itself will be </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">part of the project in the sense that I have already talked about. So the seminars that we are having in individual cities will be outputs and impacts in their own right.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In terms of Foresight and Horizon Scanning, they are both different ways of looking at the future. I hope that we are a little more effective than a crystal ball, but it has always been easier to predict the past than the future. The point about Horizon Scanning and Foresight is to look forward, to use the best evidence, to talk to the best people and to look around the world. Foresight is a parti</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">cu</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">l</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">ar</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> implementer for Horizon Scanning, where a particular topic is picked from a very broad horizon </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">survey</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and focus is based in those areas. So the Future Cities project is an example of that. A recent project that my predecessor, Sir John </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Beddington</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, undertook—the Foresight Future of Computer Trading project—was over a much shorter time scale and had important impacts. Some Foresight projects—there is a subset around certain security projects—happen over sometimes six months.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q168</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Some Foresight projects, it seems to me, have multiple target audiences. As I understand it, however, the principal target is the policy makers. How do you manage in terms of drafting documents that need to address both the policy makers, encouraging them to get the policy right following these studies, and the broader public issues, where you need behavioural change particularly to kick in to achieve the kind of vision that has emerged?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Mark </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Walport</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> If I may, I will give you an example from another Foresight project that concluded very recently, the Future of Manufacturing project, which again was kicked off by Sir John </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Beddington</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, my predecessor. The lead expert group there was chaired by Sir Richard </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Lapthorne</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> of Cable &amp; Wireless. I think most Foresight projects are not directed at just one audi</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">ence</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. The Future of Manufacturing project is about manufacturing and therefore is at least as much directed to industry as it is to Government.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There was a lot of public engagement following the production of that report. I went to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Berlin</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> to launch the report in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Germany</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, because there is a sense that the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has been viewed </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">[in some other countries] </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">as not being a significant manufacturing nation any more. That could not be further from the case: 10% of our GDP is from manufacturing. Admittedly, it is significantly down from a number of years ago, as it is in many economies, but it is still £124 billion a year approximately. It was important to talk about that with our partners in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and the Germans produced a rather similar report around the future of manufacturing.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We have seen dramatic changes in manufacturing and the impact for policy makers is that, if we are to have the best policy support for manufacturing, we need to measure it in different ways—we need to measure the whole value chain. Manufacturing is a lot more now than just turning out hundreds of widgets and measuring their value. It is everything from the design through to the embedded services that go with many products. If you buy a jet engine, you are also buying the future servicing—its re-manufacturing, effectively—over five years </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">and more</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. So that Foresight report was directed to Government but was also directed to industry. A great deal of evidence was commissioned in preparation of the report so that, as far as possible, it was a well-illuminated crystal ball, to use that metaphor.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jon Day:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> In my experience, a critical factor is to make sure that you know who your readers and customers are. That is one of the things that we have tried to do in the broader Horizon Scanning work. For example, the papers that we are producing for the group that Sir Jeremy Heywood chairs are five or six pages. By contrast, some of the work on which they are based is much longer. For example, the D</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CDC</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’s “Global Strategic Trends” that the MOD produces is a very large document.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I think the problem has often been in the past that the Horizon Scanning community has adopted a one-size-fits-all approach and has produced a single document without thinking who the customer is and what the customer needs. Part of what we are trying to do is to build on what Sir Mark has said and be more nuanced in the way in which we approach this across the board.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q169</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So you would endorse the idea of interim reports like the city report and tailored reports for different audiences?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jon Day:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Very much so.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q170</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Stephen Metcalfe:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Following on from that, can you talk specifically about the Horizon Scanning Centre? Can you give us some indication of the volume of work it does each year on behalf of Departments? What would be an average number of reports and can you give us some examples—I know you already have—of what the Horizon Scanning Centre might do?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Mark </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Walport</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> A lot of the work of the Horizon Scanning Centre is not in producing reports; it is working with networks of people both inside Government and outside to catalyse Horizon Scanning work. A recent example is the work of the Horizon Scanning Centre with DEFRA and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Cranfield</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, where </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Horizon Scanning</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Centre</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, DEFRA and the Futures team at </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Cranfield</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> ran a workshop to help inform DEFRA’s upcoming evidence investment strategy. So the Horizon Scanning Centre is running workshops. In 2012, its work on technology and innovation futures was done through workshops and helped to inform </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Science Minister</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">s </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">thinking </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">of technologies. So a lot of the Centre’s work is about catalysis. The Horizon Scanning Centre provides expertise and the reports are often ultimately produced by others.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q171</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Stephen Metcalfe:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> And the volume of work?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Mark </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Walport</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I don’t think I could tell you, although I have some information.

There is the Future Intelligence and Security Outlook Network, which focuses on security issues and includes more than 60 members from across 20 organisations.

What we tried to do was create a common description that would apply to all of these disciplines across Government.

The genesis of this was Sir Jeremy Heywood’s concern about the Government’s ability to do long-term policy planning, if you like. His concern was that the Government were not joined up in terms of what they were doing. From my own experience in defence, there is a sense of defence and security being insular at times, compared with the rest of the Government. For example, with the global strategic trends work that the Defence Development, Concept and Doctrine Centre produces, which is of the highest quality, most of the rest of Government hadn’t the faintest idea it existed.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">My aim was to try to break down the stovepipes that we had been talking about and bring a sense of relevance to this work. What struck me in the work that we did on what the situation was last year was that a lot of Horizon Scanning work was not directed by policy, but self-initiated.  It was not directed at a particular customer and was therefore often unintelligible for potential users. It was finalised and then essentially thrown over the wall into the policy area without any structure for following up. All those weaknesses, we felt, meant that there was a better way of doing things.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q185</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Stephen Mosley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Why were you specifically chosen to do the review?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jon Day:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You would have to ask Jeremy Heywood that.

We have been doing it in the Horizon Scanning field for a year, but I hope, over time, that that will be one of the real benefits of this process, and that as the reports come up to Jeremy’s group, there will be a coherent, organised, structured process of challenge. That means that there will be some occasions when the work will be pushed back to be started again or just finished.  I am keen to use this to challenge some of the preconceptions that exist within Government about what we do and do not know.

If at the end of next year they have essentially had little impact then we will not have succeeded and will need to look again at the model.

Leaving acronyms aside, I come in—I am relatively new in Government—and I look at function. I don’t think this is a complicated structure. It is basically two committees at the centre of Government. It is the Cabinet Secretary’s Advisory Group, which is supported by another committee which has the acronym GOSH.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Form should follow function and the function here works well. I then inherited within the Government Office for Science the Foresight Horizon Scanning group and they work together very effectively using the instruments of the binoculars and the telescope. That feeds into this process very well. I am delighted that the central structure is now set up in Government, which is a very good customer for the work of the Government Office for Science. If you look outside Government at the sorts of organisations that are involved in scanning the future you will see that it is those organisations that are effective and where science, engineering and technology are important. I could not conceive, personally, of having a Horizon Scanning group that did not have scientific input.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q213</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">David </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Tredinnick</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Sir Mark, you touched on this and I seek clarity here: what is the role of GO-Science in the new Horizon Scanning programme?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Mark </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Walport</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We provide support for it.

A few years ago I was privileged to attend a course—Jon Day will be familiar with it—at the Royal College of Defence Studies. There was significant academic input into the course, not just from King’s, which runs it, but from outside. It engaged the students, who are our future military strategists, on issues such as the future causes of war—water, religion, climate change, you name it. Would it not be better to have such systems inside the civil service training system so that you inculcate that thinking in every part of the civil service, rather than these committees operating independently?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jon Day:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So that I understand, are you suggesting a version of the RCDS for civilians?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q216</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair: </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Yes.
