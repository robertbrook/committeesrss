However, we are disappointed that the Government has not used the draft Bill as an opportunity to rationalise the current range of strengthened statutory scrutiny procedures, as was recommended by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee of the House of Lords in 2012. In our view there is lots of existing legislation intended to reduce regulation, but little use is made of it. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:MinionPro-Regular; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="2" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:MinionPro-Regular; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 13.25pt; padding-left:4.75pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:MinionPro-Regular; font-size:12pt">Legislative reform orders made under the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act are one of eleven existing statutory procedures with strengthened statutory scrutiny procedures. It seems ironic that the draft Deregulation Bill would bring into force yet another statutory procedure for deregulation, through the order making powers proposed in clause 51. We consider the existence of so many variations of these procedures to be unhelpful to Parliament and the public in understanding the scrutiny process. Rationalising these various procedures would in our view represent a more enlightened approach to regulatory reform.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:MinionPro-Regular; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="3" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:MinionPro-Regular; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 13.25pt; padding-left:4.75pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:MinionPro-Regular; font-size:12pt">Given the Regulatory Reform Committee’s remit, our comments are largely limited to the proposed order making powers contained in the draft Bill.
