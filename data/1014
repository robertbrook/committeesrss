font-size:12pt">In respect of the option of (a) of disqualifying prisoners sentenced to 4 years or more from voting, this besides being discriminatory, will do nothing to enhance the respect of prisoners for the 'rule of law', and the vast majority of prisoners who are being radicalised something the Government have voiced great concern about are serving more than 4 years.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">In respect of the option of (b) of disqualifying prisoners sentenced to more than 6 months the above also applies, of this being discriminatory, and doing nothing to enhance the respect for the 'rule of law', with most prisoners being radicalised serving longer than 6 months, though it cannot be established that prisoners serving such short sentences are not also open to radicalisation.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt;

A nation should not be judged by how it treats its highest citizens, but its lowest ones."
