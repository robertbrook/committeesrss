This may be perceived with differences in medical trainee numbers and vacancies across disparate regions, but may be further amplified with much greater apparent resource in the large teaching hospital compared to smaller District General Hospitals.  The effectiveness of the mechanisms by which resources are distributed geographically in the NHS has to be clear - it is a fundamental precept that the NHS should be equitable.  A national system of allocation is needed to adjudicate on equity (as has been seen in the allocation of money for Emergency departments this winter).  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.35pt;
