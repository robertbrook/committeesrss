BIVDA currently represents over 90% of the industry, and BIVDA members employ over 8,000 people, with a total industry turnover of approximately £900 million. IVDs play a crucial role in the detection, management and prevention of major diseases and, as such, they are vital in achieving an improvement in public health and health awareness. BIVDA, and its members, are committed to ensuring that opportunities are maximised for improving patient outcomes and reducing costs to the NHS.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">BIVDA welcomes the Science and Technology Committee’s inquiry into Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) and is pleased to put forward the following submission on behalf of, and in conjunction with, our members. As you will see, we have aimed to answer each question raised by the Science and Technology Committee in line with the information gathered from our membership. The consensus, however, is that the third question in the inquiry, ‘Is there sufficient research and investment into new antibiotics or other treatments and methods to ensure continued protection against infection? If not, how could this be rectified?’, would best be answered by other sources, as the question is directed at the pharmaceutical industry.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-variant:small-caps">1.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-variant:small-caps">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-variant:small-caps">How has Antibiotic Resistance developed in the past decade? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">1.1 Modern healthcare relies heavily on the use of antibiotics. the Chief Medical Officer has stated in the UK’s Five Year AMR strategy that GPs in England prescribe over 35million courses of antibiotics per year. However, bacteria are constantly adapting, and have evolved antibiotic resistance, signifying a huge threat to modern medicine. It is one of the biggest challenges we face today. Coupled with the fact that there are rarely new antibiotics released onto the market, we may find ourselves in a situation where we are unable to complete simple operations which were considered routine just fifty years ago</span><a name="_ftnref1"></a><a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">1.2 Bacteria may evolve through genetic mutation or gene transfer, although some bacteria are inherently resistant to certain antibiotics. AMR has increased on a global scale for numerous reasons, including increased exposure to, and reliance on antibiotics by humans and in animals. Therefore humans are also affected by AMR through the food chain. Additionally, globalisation is a factor; some regions of the world harbour more resistant bacteria than others, and the process of movement, flows of migration, and health tourism (e.g. from India</span><a name="_ftnref2"></a><a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">), has allowed these resistant bacteria to spread. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">1.4 The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control estimates that there are 25,000 deaths each year across Europe, caused from antimicrobial resistance. Unfortunately, this situation will only escalate if we do not act to impede the spread of resistance</span><a name="_ftnref3"></a><a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">1.3 The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has coordinated the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network</span><a name="_ftnref4"></a><a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> (EARS-Net). EARS-NET works as a network of national surveillance systems, providing European reference data on antimicrobial resistance. Their most recent annual report looks into antimicrobial resistance from invasive isolates from 29 EU/EEA countries from between 2008 to 2011</span><a name="_ftnref5"></a><a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. The results of this report show that there has been a Europe-wide increase in resistance in the gram-</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">negative pathogens under their surveillance (Escherichia Coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa), although it also states that many gram-positive pathogens are stabilising in some countries. They have also stated that combined resistance is becoming a problem in Europe for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, whereby one third of countries have significantly increased combined resistance over the four year period. The report also states that there are differences across countries, it is outlined that geographical differences follow infection control practises. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-variant:small-caps">2.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-variant:small-caps">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-variant:small-caps">What are the gaps in our knowledge about antimicrobial resistance? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">2.1 Although we have known about the possibility of antimicrobial resistance for some time, it is only recently that the threat of AMR has become so pronounced. Even now, we are still learning about the impacts of AMR, and for this reason the Department of Health has set its strategy for tackling the issue. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">2.2 While some bacteria are resistant to certain antibiotics, they may not be resistant to others. It is necessary for diagnostic tests to be used in Primary Care, so that the most appropriate antibiotic is given to a patient, rather than using a broad-spectrum drug which itself may increase AMR. There is a lack of understanding of diagnostic tests; in how they work, and the results/benefits that they can give. Our members’ feel that the diagnostic tests they produce are not always taken up in the NHS or within the healthcare sector. Rapid test diagnostics can be used at the point of care to outline the causes of illness, and whether antibiotics are appropriate. Research has shown that availability of these tests has led to a reduction in antibiotic prescriptions</span><a name="_ftnref6"></a><a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">,</span><a name="_ftnref7"></a><a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. Diagnostic tests which give detailed and sensitive readings should be used more widely. Unfortunately, their uptake is not as high as it should be, because of silo budgeting, lack of understanding, bureaucracy and also because the tests can indicate whether a patient has one or more Hospital Acquired Infections (HAI). This information may be damaging information for the hospital and may cause them to miss the targets set for levels of HAI.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">2.3 BIVDA is aware that there are new health management systems available, which can manage the patient record in primary and secondary care, and also integrate alerts, to show appropriate or inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. This may help combat problems of poor surveillance of antimicrobial use in primary and secondary care as well as the inability to link patient level data with diagnosis, microbiological testing, antimicrobial usage and clinical outcomes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">2.3 BIVDA would like to make reference to the HAPPY AUDIT (Health Alliance for Prudent Prescribing, Yield and Use of Antimicrobial Drugs in the Treatment of Respiratory Tract Infections</span><a name="_ftnref8"></a><a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">). This was a European Financed Project, looking into respiratory tract infections across 6 countries. The objective of the project was to improve the quality of diagnostic procedures and treatment of respiratory tract infections in order to ensure that only the right patients get the necessary antibiotics. The results indicated that increasing the use of diagnostics, as well as raising awareness decreased the amount of antibiotics in use. In Britain, the majority of antibiotics are provided through Primary Care.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">2.4 BIVDA believes therefore that there should be open discussion between the health community and industry, particularly regarding the uptake of diagnostics. It is important to ascertain the specific tests which are needed, as well as putting forward those which are available. Open dialogue and healthy collaboration as well as augmented education for those practising in Primary Care, will close the gaps in knowledge within this area. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-variant:small-caps">3.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-variant:small-caps">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-variant:small-caps">Is there sufficient research and investment into new antibiotics or other treatments and methods to ensure continued protection against infection?

These include restricting the use of antibiotics, increased infection control, for example through handwashing, as well as general screening and surveillance. BIVDA welcomes these considerations, as controlling the spread of resistant pathogens will require a multi-faceted approach. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">4.2 However, BIVDA regards diagnostics to be of utmost importance in achieving the goals outlined in this strategy. It is widely acknowledged that antibiotic rates are linked to resistance rates, and consequently that the reduction of unnecessary prescribing may lower resistance. As previously stated, diagnostics can indicate the makeup of different bacteria, and whether antibiotics are appropriate. This therefore means that diagnostic tests should be commonly utilised in order for patients to obtain the right drug, at the right dose, at the right time, for right duration in order to limit antibiotic exposure. A case in point is shown through Lower Respiratory Tract Infections (LRTI). These are one of the most common reasons for patients to seek medical assessment. Accordingly, LRTI accounts for 17million patient consultations in Europe, and are considered one of the most common reasons for antibiotic prescribing in Primary Care. This is significant, considering that statistics indicate that 90% of respiratory tract infections (RTI) are caused by virus, and therefore antibiotics are not likely to have any clinical benefit for the patient</span><a name="_ftnref9"></a><a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">4.3 By giving patients antibiotics when they are not needed, antimicrobial resistance is encouraged, patients are put at risk because of any associated side-effects, and it encourages the patient to seek help when the illness may simply be solved through rest and palliative care. As with the case with RTIs, most patients recover without any need for treatment</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:7.33pt; vertical-align:super">5</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">4.4 As outlined in the question above, behavioural change is important. Patients suffering from RTIs should be aware when visiting a GP, for example, that they will receive a rapid diagnostic test and if their illness is not a serious bacterial infection, then antibiotics should not be taken immediately.  The increased use of diagnostics, and the improved knowledge of the outcomes, to the public and to clinicians should mean that eventually there will be fewer GP appointments, as people have a better understanding of when they are necessary. as they are made further aware of the need to rest as opposed to believing that they need antibiotics. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">4.5 An additional point is that GP’s need to be educated and trained further, in order to improve patient care through diagnostics. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Despite initiatives in Primary Care, such as the TARGET antibiotics toolkit, developed by the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP), Public Health England (PHE) and the Antimicrobial Stewardship in Primary Care (ASPIC), antibiotic prescribing is not declining in Primary Care but is in fact increasing</span><a name="_ftnref10"></a><a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. Better tools are required at Primary Care to enable appropriate antibiotic prescribing, especially for respiratory tract infections where the symptoms can be difficult to interpret, especially if there are </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">underlying co-morbidities such as left ventricular failure, chronic lung disease or COPD and in the elderly who frequently present with non-specific symptoms and an absence of chest signs. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">4.6 The strategy of Primary Care diagnostic testing to improve decision making for antibiotic prescribing, and reduce the prescribing rate, has been successful in Nordic countries and was recently implemented in the Netherlands for acute cough.

The HAPPY AUDIT, as previously mentioned in this submission, has shown that countries which exercise an increased use of diagnostics, have lower levels of AMR. The Audit had a significant effect with a subsequent increase in the use of diagnostics. Coordination and data sharing across countries will therefore be able to show the benefits of using diagnostics in order to achieve the goal of slowing the spread of AMR. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">5.2 In September 2013, the Department of Health released their Five Year Antimicrobial Strategy, highlighting the importance of tackling antimicrobial resistance on a national and international scale. BIVDA feel that this is an excellent opportunity to encourage an increased uptake of diagnostic tests and innovative behaviour into the NHS. Britain could then act as a leader in the field, encouraging other countries, and showing available data to outline the benefits of diagnostics. It is therefore in BIVDA’s view that the Government should harness innovation and actively encourage it within the NHS, so that diagnostics are tested and taken up more widely. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">5.3 BIVDA welcome the Department of Health’s aim to coordinate between different national and international bodies and BIVDA believes that they should also combine with industry as this will allow for heightened collaboration in order to achieve these goals. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-variant:small-caps">6.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-variant:small-caps">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-variant:small-caps">What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Government’s 2013-2018 strategy for tackling antimicrobial resistance? What changes might be made to further strengthen the Government’s action plan?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">6.1 BIVDA welcomed the publication of the Department of Health’s UK Five Year Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy for 2013-2018, which sets out actions to address the key challenges to Antimicrobial Resistance, alongside DEFRA, government agencies, research councils and industry. These are important goals in society today, for Britain and for the world. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">6.2 BIVDA is concerned that the strategy is largely focused on obtaining and developing new antibiotics. BIVDA feels that although this is important, the nature of AMR is evolutionary. As this is the case, BIVDA believes wholeheartedly that a way forward for tackling AMR will be through diagnostics, ensuring that antibiotics are only prescribed in the appropriate circumstances. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">6.3 As you can see from the Government’s strategy new diagnostics and novel therapies are being discussed. However, our members feel that attention should additionally be paid to pre-existing diagnostic tests as well as investment into new ones. Concerns have been raised that diagnostic tests are not used to their full capabilities at the Point of Care. BIVDA is aware that certain diagnostic tests are currently available and used successfully in other countries, but they are not being used to their full extent in the British healthcare system today. This may be due to a lack of knowledge about the full range of uses that diagnostics can provide, silo budgeting within Trusts and getting the tests themselves into the NHS.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">6.4 BIVDA welcomes the Government’s initiatives which aim to educate those in the healthcare sector as well as the public about the challenges of AMR, appropriate use of antibiotics, diagnostics and novel therapies, and hopes that this will become entrenched into society. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">6.5 The Department of Health’s strategy discusses the idea that a way to conserving and stewarding the effectiveness of existing treatments may be undertaken through exploring the possibility of developing a ‘drugs resistance index’ to communicate gaps in antibiotic effectiveness. BIVDA’s members believe that if this idea is considered, a case could also be made for extending this, and developing a diagnostics-index, which could show the different diagnostic tests available, the uptake of diagnostic tests, as compared to the use of antibiotics. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">6.6 BIVDA members have raised concerns, however, that without giving a heightened impetus to the health sector to take on more diagnostic tests, they may not do so even if it is to their detriment. This is because changing behaviours, becoming innovative and therefore increasing opportunities for risk, may not lead to change. BIVDA believe that there is a strong case for cooperation between government, the health sector and industry, in the long term, rather than shorter governmental cycles.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">November 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="color:#070ea1; font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div><hr style="width:33%; height:1px; text-align:left" /><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn1"></a><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt"> Department of Health, UK (2013) Five Year Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy 2013 to 2018.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="color:#070ea1; font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn2"></a><a href="#_ftnref2">[2]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt"> The European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance  Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance in Europe, 2011. </span><a href="http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/antimicrobial-resistance-surveillance-europe-2011.pdf"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt; text-decoration:underline">http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/antimicrobial-resistance-surveillance-europe-2011.pdf</span></a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt; text-decoration:underline">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn3"></a><a href="#_ftnref3">[3]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt"> European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, </span><a href="http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/Pages/home.aspx"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt; text-decoration:underline">http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/Pages/home.aspx</span></a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="color:#070ea1; font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn4"></a><a href="#_ftnref4">[4]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt"> European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net), Annual report, 2011, accessed here: </span><a href="http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/antimicrobial-resistance-surveillance-europe-2011.pdf"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt; text-decoration:underline">http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/antimicrobial-resistance-surveillance-europe-2011.pdf</span></a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt; text-decoration:underline">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn5"></a><a href="#_ftnref5">[5]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt"> Department of Health, UK (2013) Five Year Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy 2013 to 2018.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="color:#070ea1; font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn6"></a><a href="#_ftnref6">[6]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">Brian J.
