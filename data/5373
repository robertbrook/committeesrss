CLA members own or manage approximately half the rural land in England and Wales including edge of settlement locations and some urban portfolios. The quality of the countryside, and its natural resources, is of vital importance to our members. Most objectives for the countryside - economic, social and environmental - rely on landowners and managers for their success.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">CLA has a long-standing interest in the prevention and containment of Invasive and Alien Species (IAS), in particular the grey squirrel, Muntjac deer, Japanese knotweed, Himalayan balsam, pennywort, signal crayfish and Asian long-horned beetle, as these cause a significant amount of damage to woodlands and waterways. Other impacts of IAS include loss of crops, damaged buildings and loss of ecosystem services. The land manager bears the cost of tackling IAS.  While effective prevention can avoid entry of IAS in the first place, we should not lose sight of the importance of the containment of IAS already in the UK. With the significant cost of control and eradication set to rise further, such activity is regarded as a priority for land managers.  Funding needs to be provided to ensure work is affordable for land managers, and that the programme of containment and eradication is of sufficient quality.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Question 1</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">The proposed size of the list of species of concern</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">There are approximately 1500 known i</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">nvasive alien species (IAS)</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> within the EU. CLA is concerned by the proposed cap of 50 species of EU concern, which would cap the number of priority species to the top 3% of the list. Each member state will draw up their own list of 50 top IAS concerns from which the EU will put together an EU level list of 50 top IAS concerns. We assume that funding will be available to address the EU top 50 IAS list. The proposal for a five year review, and possible extension of this list, while welcome, may not be soon enough to help combat the entry of IAS in the meantime.  Emergency measures, including bans, can be implemented by Members States on the basis of preliminary scientific evidence; however, if this concerns a newly identified, rather than a known IAS, this could prove challenging. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">According to the GB Non-Native Species Secretariat (NNSS), there are 2,000 IAS established in Britain, with 10 new species established a year, almost half (48%) of which come from Europe. Under Article 10, Member States are able to ban the intentional release of IAS, on top of the IAS of EU concern, based on scientific evidence. This means that action must be adequately resourced and relevant at a national level. The Commission proposes that Member States risk assess invasive species in their countries, with the results being used to draw up a list of species of ‘union concern’. The CLA are concerned that due to the isolation of the UK and resulting differentiation in habitats and species, that a Union list collated from all Member States will not adequately represent the UK, for example, grey </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">squirrels.

Whilst it is reasonable to put more effort and resources into the prevention of further IAS into the EU, the €12 billion a year costs of damage relates to IAS already present.

These enormous costs </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">are a consequence of the failure to take action in the past.

The report also revealed an exponential increase in the cost of control as an invasion progresses, and demonstrated the benefits of intervention at an early stage, as well as the long term cost savings if eradication is undertaken early in the invasion process.  The GB NNSS has since quantified the cost (damage and control) to the UK economy at £2.1 billion a year, with the UK Government supporting the management of about 25 species.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Prevention is internationally recognised as the most effective way</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">of avoiding the IAS problem.

It is difficult to see that a policy that is implementing stronger control measures and regulations will not have a greater additional financial burden than the Commission proposal of €26-40 million a year, on top of the existing annual cost of €1.4 billion. Given the increasing number of IAS entering the EU, the cost of damage can only rise; thus there must be an argument for greater investment in control measures.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Member States lack the necessary means</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> to implement the recommendations </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">, which could place undue burdens on land managers</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">.

Finally, the Birds Directive (2009/147/EC) and</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC), the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) and the</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Marine Strategy Framework Directive (2008/56/EC) require the restoration of ecological</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">conditions and refer to the need to take IAS into consideration. Nevertheless, existing </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">EU </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">action leaves most IAS unaddressed.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The benefits of working at an EU level include learning from actions and effective measures taken in other countries for species which may have only recently become an issue nationally. We do, however, feel that any ‘top 50’ list drawn up at EU level will not adequately represent our situation, due to the difference in habitat type and species found. Therefore, the CLA believe that each Member State should be given the opportunity to target their top invasive species, in order to ensure that support is evenly spread.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Given the level of damage caused by invasive species, it is difficult to see any significant environmental conflicts with other environmental obligations. That said the main conflict </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">between the need to tackle invasive species and other environmental obligations</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> is likely to be over the allocation of finite funds to address different environmental priorities.  </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">There may be a suggestion that we should take a different approach to species that are currently rare or endangered in their native range. For example, in the UK, the population of Chinese water deer is small but expanding, and has the potential to become invasive. Current management strategy is influenced by the fact that it is rare in its native range. It is questionable whether this is the correct response to that situation.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">It is important that obstacles are not put in the way of efforts to manage IAS. The inability of a landowner to identify IAS should not result in direct penalty. Individuals concerned are likely to need a high degree of knowledge, and in all likelihood a non-native invasive species will be unfamiliar to a significant proportion of the population; as such it would be unreasonable to impose an obligation dependent on them being able to identify IAS. An objective should be included to not add further red tape to the agricultural industry. An illustrative example of a flawed process is that surrounding the licensing of Warfarin, the most effective control measure for grey squirrel (sciurus carolinensis) in the UK. It will be illegal to use Warfarin for this purpose from April 2014, due to the exorbitant cost or re-registering the product for such use. This is a classic case of unintended consequences of EU regulation that must be reversed.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Question 6: </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">What the UK’s strategy should be and where, if at all, the UK should diverge from, or go further than, the proposed EU approach</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The UK is an island and in some instances, at least theoretically, this offers the potential to put measures in place to build a stronger defence against the incursion or export of some IAS.
