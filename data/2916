Victims tell me loudly and clearly that offenders do not lose their liberty without good reason and often have had a number of opportunities to change their behaviour through the CJS with non custodial measures and sentencing. I do understand and indeed respect that not all victims would feel this way. From a personal point of view as a victim of crime it seems quite bizarre that when some victims lose their rights to vote through death, serious mental incapacity that offenders retain theirs. There does need to be consequences to each individual person’s actions and if they wish us to respect their right to vote, they should choose through personal responsibility to respect the law and the persons they hurt.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:center"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
