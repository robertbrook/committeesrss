The Planning and Energy Act’s ‘Merton Rule’ is therefore the only policy tool explicitly incentivising on-site renewables in new homes and allowing for higher overall energy performance standards, and must remain available to local authorities at least until Building Regulations are sufficiently strong to drive uptake of on-site renewables in new homes (which will not be before 2016 at the earliest).</span><br /><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></li><li style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:11pt">Part L of the ‘2013’ Building Regulations will come into force in April 2014, a year later than promised by this Government, and a year later than anticipated by industry. It was originally planned to require energy performance akin to Code for Sustainable Homes (‘the Code’) level 4. This would have made it consistent with the requirement for zero carbon homes from 2016, and would have been the continuation of the roadmap for the tightening of Part L standards, as pioneered by the Code, since 2005. The Housing Standards Review consultation consistently uses as justification for its proposals to scrap the voluntary Code standards and the powers granted to local authorities by the Planning and Energy Act the fact that Part L 2013 is equivalent to being between Code levels 3 and 4.</span><br /><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></li><li style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:11pt">This means that Part L has now for the first time diverged from the roadmap to 2016, and is actually situated much closer to Code level 3 than level 4 (the latter being the level required of new social housing since 2010). Not only has it diverged, it has fallen behind schedule. Against this backdrop, the powers granted to local authorities under the Planning and Energy Act are more important than ever in ensuring 2016 can be met at least cost and maximum benefit, by continuing to drive sustainability, innovation, and learning effects in the construction sector – a role which Part L is now in a less strong position to play than it could have been.</span><br /><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></li><li style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:11pt">As the Impact Assessment accompanying the consultation reports, 39% of homes are being built to Code levels 3 and above. What appears to have been forgotten throughout is that homes compliant with the Code are of higher quality and desirability than homes not built to the Code, and that occupants face lower running costs. Many, if not most, local authorities around the country understand this. The Greater London Authority now proposes to move to a 40% improvement on 2010 building regulations for all planning submissions to the Mayor from October 2013</span><a name="_ftnref3"></a><a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:11pt">.

The first justification used is that a diversity of higher and nationally recognised voluntary standards being required of developers makes new housing construction less economically viable. There is zero evidence in the consultation’s impact assessment to substantiate this, and new housing starts have been increasing consistently this year compared to 2012. The second justification used argues higher than minimum energy standards, based on the Code, only have a ‘shelf life’ of three years as all new homes will have to be built to zero carbon standards from 2016. This justification is then also used to argue that the Planning and Energy Act “may need to be amended or removed”.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="6" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:11pt">In one fell swoop, the consultation attempts to remove widely recognised higher energy performance standards for new homes as well as the Planning and Energy Act.

It will always be possible to build homes to a higher standard, and innovation in energy efficient and low carbon construction will of course continue beyond 2016. The proposals put forward would merely serve to stifle this innovation.

Over the summer, Yvette Cooper, the Housing Minister, proposed new planning guidance under which it would be possible to meet the 10 per cent rule by using off-site renewables. In other words, instead of integrating a wind turbine into the new development, the developers could invest in an offshore wind farm which might have been built anyway, thereby failing to improve the provision of non-carbon energy. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 17.85pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 17.85pt"><span style="font-family:Cambria; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Miss Cooper has since said that the Government remains committed to the rule.

Setting targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions is the easy bit; achieving them is far more difficult. What is most ingenious about the Merton rule is not its potential for energy saving but that councils can adopt it on a voluntary basis and negotiate it locally with developers. Apart from Merton, 25 other boroughs have followed suit. Another 100 want to change their local plans to include the provision. They are doing it without Whitehall having to tell them to.
