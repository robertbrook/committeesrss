However, there are many potential indirect contributions to research as indicated in the Silverman review (Table 1, p.6).  In the assessment of grant proposals to RCUK, it is important that, where appropriate, reviewers who appreciate the forensic scientific nature of a proposal be appointed.  A pool of suitable reviewers is required.  It is not yet clear that forensic science has been established as a strategic research priority for the Research Councils, another key recommendation of the Silverman review though there have been contacts between RCUK, academics, industry and end users about this.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="6" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 13.25pt; padding-left:4.75pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The Society notes with approval that there is now a Knowledge Transfer Network established by the Technology Strategy Board.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="7" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 13.25pt; padding-left:4.75pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">However, the Society is concerned that the UK lacks any permanent institution or body with the authority and expertise to formulate an overall strategy addressing the needs of the justice system and supporting future research and development through appropriate funding, collaborative working and sharing of resources, as recommended by the Forensic Science Society in its submission to the Silverman review. There is also an urgent need for strategic direction in professional training and the development of normative frameworks for ethical practice (to underpin and supplement existing ethics codes produced by professional organisations and learned societies, etc.).</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">An independent forensic science institute with a remit to commission and conduct research and development in forensic science would be the most obvious, and perhaps most desirable, way of filling this significant institutional gap in the UK’s criminal justice machinery. Notably, Recommendation 1 of the US National Academies’ wide-ranging and authoritative review of forensic science in the USA was that:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">To promote the development of forensic science into a mature field of multidisciplinary research and practice, founded on the systematic collection and analysis of relevant data, Congress should establish and appropriate funds for an independent federal entity, the National Institute of Forensic Science (NIFS).

With the FSS disbanded, and its expertise dissipated (and potentially draining away), the creation of an independent institute presents greater challenges. Moreover, there is an additional element of urgency, in that some key staff may retire or relocate overseas before their advice or other, more substantial, contributions can be secured.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="8" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 13.25pt; padding-left:4.75pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Proper attention has to be paid to the differing needs of “research”, understood as original investigation undertaken in order to gain knowledge and understanding, and “development”, meaning the translation of research outputs into procedures and tools with practical utility. The Silverman review recommends a regular single cross-disciplinary forensic science conference, facilitated by the Forensic Science Regulator.  It is important that such conferences cover all aspects of forensic science research and development.  The programme has to include reports of blue-sky research.  Presentation of such research to bring it to the attention of forensic scientists can only be to the benefit of all parties, the research scientists and the forensic scientists. The conferences must not be concerned solely with policing requirements or with issues of cost and timeliness. Space and time are needed for original thought.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="9" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 13.25pt; padding-left:4.75pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The Society is concerned that judicial evidence should be evaluated and interpreted correctly. This is a vital, yet frequently overlooked or downplayed, dimension of forensic science.   A recent (July 2012) report by Gill, Guiness and Iveson on the interpretation of DNA evidence for the Forensic Science Regulator provides an example of this importance.  It is perverse for the administration of justice to commit resources to promoting scientific work of the highest quality, if the resulting evidence is then evaluated incorrectly or misinterpreted in court, potentially leading to miscarriages of justice. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">It is worth noting that some statements that forensic scientists have routinely stated, for example, that a particular technique provides a unique identification, are now of questionable scientific validity and some courts in the US have limited what can be said.  The book by Brandon Garrett </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">(2011) </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Convicting the Innocent</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> (Harvard University Press) studied the first 250 people exonerated by the Innocence Project on the basis of DNA evidence (theirs did NOT match the crime scene). In 75% of the cases, there was erroneous eye witness testimony and in 75% of the cases there were errors in the forensic evidence (some cases had both types of incorrect evidence). Also, some state courts now carefully examine eyewitness identifications and evaluate whether "line-ups" were properly conducted. Two examples are State v. Lawson Or. No S059234 (2012) and State v. Henderson 27. A. 3d 872 (NJ. 2011). </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Scientific evidence today plays an ever-expanding role in criminal proceedings in the UK, and statistics and probabilistic reasoning underpin modern science. One unfortunate consequence of the closure of the FSS, however, has been the dispersal of its in-house statistics and interpretation group.  This group was a significant national asset, both in terms of its direct input into FSS case-work and as a producer of published research at the cutting edge of international debate. The synergy which arises when a group of talented individuals work together far outweighs the opportunity for the education of others that may be thought a benefit of dispersal.
