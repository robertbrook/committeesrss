Do you agree with the proposal that providers should only be paid for work carried out on an application for judicial review, including a request for reconsideration of the application at a hearing, the renewal hearing, or an onward permission appeal to the Court of Appeal, if permission is granted by the Court (but that reasonable disbursements should be payable in any event)? Please give reasons. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">The Parole Board is very concerned about any attempts to limit the access which offenders will have to judicial review.  The parole process is unusual in that it is a judicial process for which there is no formal appeals mechanism.  As such, judicial review is the only avenue for offenders to formally challenge the decisions of the Parole Board.  Whilst our aim is to avoid legal challenges, the Parole Board is committed to a system which provides justice for all those affected by it and the opportunity to challenge parole decisions legally is an essential aspect of that.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q7. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Do you agree with the proposed scope of criminal legal aid services to be competed?
