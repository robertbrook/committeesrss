Since primates and humans are more closely related in evolutionary terms than say, people and dogs, the risk of transmitting serious infection either from primate to human, or vice versa, is very real. There are a number of potentially serious viral and bacterial diseases that may be transmitted via saliva, nasal secretions or faeces. These are in addition to the risks of injury to people from bites or scratches.</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; line-height:13.5pt; margin:12pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Implementation of a ban on the keeping of primates as pets.</span></p><ol type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="background-color:#ffffff; font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; line-height:13.5pt; margin:12pt 0pt 12pt 33.01pt; padding-left:2.99pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">The first step towards the implementation of a ban would be a government announcement for all owners of primates kept as pets to register them with their local authority. Registration would require a record and identification of each and every primate, either by a detailed physical description, photographs, etc., or else by way of a microchip. Those found subsequently with pet primates who failed to register by a set deadline would face a significant fine. This would also include all primate rescue centres, pet shops, etc. </span></li></ol><p style="background-color:#ffffff; line-height:13.5pt; margin:12pt 0pt 12pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Once registered, the premises would be visited as soon as possible by a veterinary inspection team (ideally a veterinary surgeon and an animal behaviourist) to assess the health and welfare of the primates. If the health and welfare conditions were found to be significantly lacking (based on a predetermined list of criteria, along the lines of the Five Freedoms), then the primate(s) would be confiscated and placed in a suitable sanctuary. The costs to the sanctuaries of keeping additional animals could be met in part by the fines collected from individuals who had not registered their primates and from licence fees (see below). </span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; line-height:13.5pt; margin:12pt 0pt 12pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">However, if the health and welfare conditions were found to be very marginally lacking then the inspection team could carefully weigh up the possibility of issuing a list of improvements to the owner, and provided these could be met within a specified time period, allow the owner to keep the primate as a pet. This exception would apply chiefly to those situations where there is convincing evidence to show that the owner and primate have formed a strong emotional bond and to separate them could conceivably cause more distress to the primate than removal to a sanctuary (assuming a suitable sanctuary would be available). In these </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">cases, arrangements would need to be made to ensure that the primate could not be used for breeding purposes (e.g. contraception, sterilisation or other appropriate guarantee). Owners allowed to keep their primates as pets would need to pay an annual licence fee to ensure that the primate could be accounted for, for the rest of its life. The licence fee could also go towards covering the cost of sanctuaries who receive confiscated primates.</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; line-height:13.5pt; margin:12pt 0pt 12pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; line-height:13.5pt; margin:12pt 0pt 12pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">January 2014 </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
