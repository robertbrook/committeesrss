However, it needs to be remembered that there are many ways of achieving that impact. It would be a mistake to use a Government response to a report as the chief indicator of effectiveness: sometimes recommendations made by committees are rejected initially but are taken up much later. Sometimes the act of holding an inquiry and exposing a subject area to the glare of scrutiny can achieve an impact simply by requiring officials to examine policy from first principles.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="4" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.11pt; padding-left:7.19pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">To take one example: we have pressed the Foreign and Commonwealth Office almost since the start of this Parliament to recognise language skills within the competency framework used for promotion to the highest levels of the Department. We take the view that excluding language skills from the framework risks populating the senior ranks of the Department with staff who have strong general management skills but who, because of a lack of facility in learning and using a foreign language, may lack the credibility needed to command respect in key diplomatic postings. The FCO has until now stoutly resisted our argument; but we have recently learnt that it is to change its policy and reflect language learning within the competency framework. We have yet to consider the detail, but we hope that this will be a step towards increasing the chances that our diplomats overseas are perceived favourably by host nations – and that they will wield greater influence as a result.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="5" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.11pt; padding-left:7.19pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">A similar change of heart appears to be under way on the provision of information on numbers of staff at each overseas mission. We have been continually frustrated by the Department’s refusal to provide precise figures – even in confidence – on staffing at individual posts. We argued that this was a hindrance to us in our work if we could not keep track of trends over time. The Department has consistently cited security concerns for not divulging exact figures; but it has now stated that it is considering the best way to present detailed information on staffing levels overseas, including provision of unrounded figures. This is a significant advance for future scrutiny, and we have no doubt that sustained pressure from this Committee will have played a part in the decision.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="6" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.11pt; padding-left:7.19pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Similar progress has been made in clarifying the number of UK nationals working for the main European Union institutions. The FCO has recognised the poor (and worsening) representation of UK staff in EU institutions, but we found it difficult to compile an accurate picture of quite how bad the situation was, as the data had to be drawn from multiple sources. Following a recommendation from the Committee, the FCO has agreed to publish an annual report bringing together these data.   </span></li></ol><p style="line-height:14.5pt; margin:17pt 0pt 10pt; page-break-after:avoid"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:13pt; font-weight:bold">Core tasks</span></p><ol start="7" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.11pt; padding-left:7.19pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We welcome the Liaison Committee’s redefinition of core tasks for departmental select committees.

There is little primary legislation emanating from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office: what there is tends either to have constitutional significance (and to receive extensive scrutiny on the floor of the House and in the media) or to be minor and relatively uncontentious. The FCO has not been responsible for any draft bills in the last twelve months. There was potential for post-legislative scrutiny of the European Union (Amendment) Act 2008, but as this had been almost entirely superseded by subsequent legislation, we agreed with the FCO that it made little sense to require the Department to lay a memorandum on post-legislative scrutiny of the Act.</span></li></ol><p style="line-height:14.5pt; margin:17pt 0pt 9.95pt; page-break-after:avoid"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Appointments</span></p><ol start="9" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14.11pt; padding-left:7.19pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We have no formal role, recognised by the Government, in any public appointment.

However, we believe that this goes beyond providing timely reports, as indicated by Core Task 9. The House benefits directly, for instance, from evidence, including correspondence from Ministers. Our recent report on the FCO’s human rights work dealt with the delicate subject of attendance by the Prime Minister at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Colombo in November 2013. The report was cited during backbench debates, in debates in the House of Lords, during FCO Oral Questions and indeed on the floor of the House with the Prime Minister; but it was not simply the Committee’s observations that informed the House. The chain of correspondence between the Committee Chairman and the Foreign Secretary, which was published by the Committee, provided crucial detail on the FCO’s policy both when the decision was taken to award to Sri Lanka the right to host the CHOGM and  subsequently.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="11" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 20.19pt; padding-left:1.11pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We also take very seriously a role which is not mentioned in the core tasks – that of scrutinising on behalf of the House treaties and departmental minutes covering gifts to foreign nations or organisations. As you will be aware, for treaties subject to the provisions of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010, if Parliament resolves within 21 sitting days of the treaty being laid that it should not be ratified, the Government must consider that opinion before proceeding with ratification of that treaty. We strongly believe that it would be remiss if the Foreign Affairs Committee, as an informed body representative of the House, did not assess the implications of such treaties when there are policy implications for the FCO. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="12" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 20.19pt; padding-left:1.11pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We therefore considered three Agreements with Uzbekistan, laid in February 2013, enabling the recovery by air and by rail of personnel and equipment from Afghanistan.

We have not opted for a formal strategic plan, along the lines recommended by the Liaison Committee, and we would be wary of publishing such a thing. Our work will need to mirror to some degree that of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office; and the Department’s work, more than most, is driven by external events over which it may have very little control. A strategic plan for the Foreign Affairs Committee, unless defined in the broadest of terms, could soon seem irrelevant.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="17" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 20.19pt; padding-left:1.11pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We agree, however, that when committees consider their future work programme, they should take decisions on subjects for inquiry in the context of a long-term vision of what issues should be addressed at some point during the Parliament, either because they are fundamental to the UK’s foreign policy approach or because they consume a disproportionately large slice of the Department’s resources. Some areas need to be revisited regularly: this is something which we recognised at the outset, in July 2010, when we resolved to examine on an annual basis the FCO’s work on human rights and to inquire into each Departmental Annual Report published by the Department. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="18" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 20.19pt; padding-left:1.11pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The Liaison Committee rightly encourages committees to include in their inquiries, as a matter of routine, consideration of financial aspects and implications of policies being examined. Finance should not be treated as an occasional exercise, reserved for evidence sessions on the Annual Report and Accounts, and examination of the Estimates: it permeates every inquiry. In the light of the Spending Review, it has been standard for each of our inquiries to examine the impact of the savings programme on staffing levels and programme spending, and the resources available to organisations which complement the Department in projecting the values and culture of the UK, principally the British Council and the BBC World Service.</span></li></ol><p style="line-height:14.5pt; margin:17pt 0pt 10pt; page-break-after:avoid"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:13pt; font-weight:bold">Evidence</span></p><ol start="19" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 20.19pt; padding-left:1.11pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We note the suggestion made to the Liaison Committee by some witnesses that the practice of allocating areas of questioning to individual members might not always be effective, and that witnesses might escape proper scrutiny by avoiding answering the question in the knowledge that questioning would move on after five or ten minutes. We recognise the danger; but the solution lies principally with individual committee members, their skills in eliciting information, and their sense of common purpose. Sometimes that will involve open questioning, and sometimes it will be a matter of persistence and combined effort and pressure. We have no fixed time limit for individual questioners, and there is certainly no bar to committee members following up on unsatisfactory responses to questions posed by colleagues.  </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify"><br style="page-break-before:always; clear:both" /></p><ol start="20" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 20.19pt; padding-left:1.11pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The Liaison Committee put forward a number of alternative proposals for improving questioning. Opinion is divided on the merits of appointing rapporteurs to lead inquiries, or of choosing “lead questioners” for evidence sessions, as suggested by the Liaison Committee, but we are yet to be persuaded. The dangers of limiting other committee members’ engagement with an inquiry would seem to us to outweigh any advantage that might accrue from a more exclusive approach. Committee members would probably feel uncomfortable signing up to a report if they had not had a full opportunity to test the evidence. Nonetheless, we are aware of experiments in this field by other committees and await with interest the outcome. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="21" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 20.19pt; padding-left:1.11pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The Committee’s point about diversity of witnesses is well made. We face a difficulty in this respect as, unlike committees which are concerned with public services largely implemented by professionals with a clear set of “customers” (such as education and health), the “user group” for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is not clearly defined, and the professional cadre involved is the staff of the FCO itself. We tend to rely heavily on evidence from major public figures, thinktanks, academics and former diplomats.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="22" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 20.19pt; padding-left:1.11pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We hope to overcome this in a forthcoming inquiry into the FCO’s consular services, which are the public-facing arm of the Department.

Shorter, more focused and specific inquiries and reports, and more use of one-off evidence sessions, would also enable a greater throughput of work and a more nimble response to events when required. We intend that some of our reports in the remainder of the Parliament should be considerably shorter, with a focus on specific recommendations clearly targeted at the Government.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="24" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 20.19pt; padding-left:1.11pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We take a systematic approach to Government responses to reports.

We use our time to the full: in under 24 hours in Vienna in March, the Committee attended a briefing meeting at the British Embassy; we held a breakfast meeting with Austrian politicians to discuss the Committee’s inquiry into UK Government policy on the future of the EU; we met senior figures in the UN Office of Drugs and Crime to discuss piracy, in the context of the Committee’s inquiry into piracy off the coast of Somalia; and we held three meetings in connection with our inquiry into the Iranian nuclear programme – one with senior figures at the International Atomic Energy Authority, one with Permanent Representatives to the IAEA from the US, France, Germany and the UK; and another with the Iranian Permanent Representative. In Bahrain in March, we held eleven meetings in a single day, in connection with our inquiry into the UK’s relations with Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify"><br style="page-break-before:always; clear:both" /></p><ol start="29" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 20.19pt; padding-left:1.11pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">We would encourage the Liaison Committee not to think in terms of cutting back further on the budget for overseas travel but to at least maintain it and to justify it energetically to sceptics.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">9 December 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:right"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; letter-spacing:-0.15pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Minion Pro'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
