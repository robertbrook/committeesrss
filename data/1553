It is hailed by its architect as the answer to all rural transport problems. However, local experience shows it to be </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">a financial burden to the taxpayer, and to be operating in a most inefficient manner, which causes it to be unpopular. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">6.3.2 The set-up of </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">Bwcabus</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal"> is too complicated.

Its own websi</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">te purports to have a budget of £2.9million. It has been revealed by the FOI that massive sums have been put in from the various taxpayers’ purses, be it via local authority, Welsh Government or European funding, whilst only a small fraction has been forth</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">coming from the users. In 2012, the operator took just over £10,000 from customers, most of that amount from reimbursement of people’s bus passes.  In that same year, the University of Glamorgan was paid £91,187.86 in fees.  These figures merely illustrate</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal"> the gross inadequacy of the system from a financial point of view. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">6.3.4 The </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">Bwcabus</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal"> scheme is also mixed up with various scheduled services. These scheduled services can be accessed by anybody without previously booking; the rest has to be booked in adv</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">ance. The system is cumbersome and is set up in such a way as to have a high failure rate. As a consequence, these buses are seen sitting empty in lay-bys for many hours each day. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">6.4 Most people in rural areas live in sizeable communities along major tra</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">nsport corridors. These can be reached by normal scheduled services.

For example, most children get to school by bus in rural Wales. School buses are mostly used for transporting children to and from school. Consequently these vehicles only run in term times and are sitting idle most of the </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">day. Social services operate their own vehicles, often with just one or two customers on board. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">7. 3.2 There needs to be a reappraisal of how such vehicles are deployed. There are some good examples of how this can be done.

This works out much cheaper. Many of the pupils can be transported on scheduled services. The trouble has been with the lack of seatbelts. Again, Lloyds Coache</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">s has managed to overcome this issue by having seatbelts on all their vehicles. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">8.1 Additional comments</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal">8.2 Competition between bus operators does not make for an efficient and cost effective service for passengers in rural areas.
