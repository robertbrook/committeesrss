Compared to state schools where the local authority and ultimately the government can be called in to exert accountability, it's not even possible to have a dialogue with an academy's directors (aka governors) if they </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">dont</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> want to have one. Repeated attempts to contact and speak with parent governors were ignored, complaints to the secretary of state for education were referred to the education funding agency (no surprise there as no-one expects Michael Gove to do anything but support academies) and the EFA's response was to refer to the office of the schools adjudicator if we felt there was an issue with admissions (which we did).</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">This is a completely unsatisfactory situation which means the taxpayer (for it is still the taxpayer footing the bill) has no right to question what the academy does, no recourse to a formally laid down process to engage with the academy and the academy has no obligation to respond to questions raised or engage with the community. Academies are being run and treated like private companies, but companies have shareholders who can hold the directors accountable, dismiss  directors and appoint new ones. This is an impossibility at the moment.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">A school like this is in charge of a budget of approximately £5m per annum, assets of around £2m and around 600 young peoples' educations.
