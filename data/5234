The </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Broadcasting Act 1996 </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">gives the Secretary of State of Culture, Media &amp; Sport the power to designate key sporting </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">and other events</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> as ‘listed events’. The purpose of the list is to ensure that such events are made available to all television viewers, particularly those who do not have subscription television. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) explains that a ’listed event’ is “one which is generally felt to have special national resonance” and which contains “an element which serves to unite the nation, a shared point on the national calendar”</span><a name="_ftnref4"></a><a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">. For this reason, such events are protected by law to ensure that they are available to as many viewers as possible, particularly those who cannot afford the extra cost of subscription television. Arqiva believes, the Leadership Debates broadcast during a UK General Election campaign are of such significance to our public and civic life, that they should be treated as ‘national events’ which should also be protected with the same principle as ‘listed events’.  </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Looking back:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="4" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.11pt; padding-left:3.89pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">In 2010, for the first time in British politics, the leaders of each of the three main parties took part in Prime Ministerial Debates during the general election campaign. Each debate ran for ninety minutes, and was broadcast weekly by ITV, BSkyB and the BBC over three successive Thursday evenings, starting on 15 April. The first half of each debate focused on a particular topic - domestic affairs, foreign affairs and the economy respectively - with the second half allowing for a discussion of general issues, with questions picked from the audience. They took place in various locations across the UK– the first in Manchester, the second Bristol and the final debate was in Leicester. Whether owing to their uniqueness, there was considerable advance-publicity, post-event analysis and comment on both national and social media. They impacted on the public consciousness</span><a name="_ftnref5"></a><a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> – and changed the course of the campaign, even if their actual impact on the election result remains debatable.

Only four out of 14 television regions had actually completed TV switchover – Border, West Country, Wales and Granada, which only amounted to 21% of the UK population. Despite 23 million UK households already having digital TV on their main set by April 2010 a significant 10.5% of households still lacked access to Digital – and were deprived of the opportunity to watch the second debate broadcast ‘live’ on Sky News. This group included a disproportionate number of senior citizens who relied on analogue TV news and radio, rather than the Internet, as the main source of news. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Looking forward:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="8" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32.11pt; padding-left:3.89pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Of course, any potential debates held in 2015 would be post-TV Switchover.
