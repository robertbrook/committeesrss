The Government believes that those who do not have a strong connection should not be prioritised for public funding in the same way as those who do have a strong connection. I believe that the residence test I have put forward is a fair and appropriate way to demonstrate such a strong connection. We must ensure that limited resource is targeted appropriately. This is always an important responsibility of Government but even more so at a time of financial constraint. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">This is why I will be introducing a residence test for individuals who are applying for civil legal aid. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="13" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">I am satisfied that the proposed residence test complies with Article 6 of the ECHR. An important point to note from the outset is that anyone excluded from accessing civil legal aid because of the residence test will be able to apply for exceptional funding under section 10 of LASPO (including applications for services which are described in Part 1 of Schedule 1 to LASPO</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">from which the individual would be excluded as a result of the residence test). This ensures that civil legal aid will continue to be provided in any individual case where failure do so would breach the applicant's rights to legal aid under the ECHR or EU law (or, in the light of the risk of such a breach, it is appropriate to provide legal aid). Accordingly, the system has been specifically set up so as to avoid a breach of Convention rights; and any person who is entitled to legal aid under Article 6 ECHR will continue to receive legal aid notwithstanding their ability to meet the residence test.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="14" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">I am also satisfied that the test complies with Article 14 of the ECHR, taken with Article 6. Whilst we recognise that it may be easier for British nationals to satisfy the test than other nationals, we consider that the test is justified and proportionate to the legitimate aim of the provision. It is a reasonable principle that individuals should have a strong connection to the </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> in order to benefit from the civil legal aid scheme for the reasons summarised in </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">paragraph 12</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> above. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="15" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">The requirement to be lawfully resident at the time of applying for civil legal aid and to have been lawfully resident for 12 months in the past is a fair and appropriate way to demonstrate such a strong connection. A period of 12 months of previous lawful residence demonstrates a meaningful connection with the </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">. A test such as this inevitably </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">involves making a choice on how a strong connection is best demonstrated. We consider that the test proposed, taken together with the exceptional funding provision at section 10 of LASPO, strikes the correct, justified and proportionate balance by focusing on past and current connection to the </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="16" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">In the light of these points, we consider that the proposed residence test is lawful, justified and appropriate. However, in the light of the consultation responses, we have modified our approach in some areas.

Having listened to </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">consultees</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> views, we agree that there are further limited circumstances where applicants for civil legal aid on certain matters of law (as set out in Schedule 1 to LASPO) should not be required to meet the residence test.

The Government continues to believe that legal aid should be focussed on those judicial review cases where it is really required. However, the Government has listened to concerns raised by a number of respondents who argued that the original proposal would also affect meritorious cases where permission </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">is not granted simply because the case concludes prior to the permission decision. The Government is now consulting on a further proposal whereby, in addition to the original proposal not to pay a provider unless a case is granted permission, the LAA will have a discretionary power to pay providers in certain other cases which conclude prior to permission.

In relation to an individual case in which a provider agrees to act and which passes the means and merits tests for legal aid, the individual will receive representation and therefore there can be no issue of incompatibility with Article 6 ECHR. The financial risk will rest with the provider, not the client, who will remain in receipt of legal aid. Arguments were raised by respondents to the Transforming Legal Aid consultation that the proposal would have a wider chilling effect on judicial review applications, in that providers would be unwilling to take on legally aided judicial review cases at risk. This, it was argued, would lead to individuals being unable to obtain legal aid for a judicial review and inhibit their right of access to a court under Article 6 ECHR. It was argued that this would affect vulnerable clients (who might share certain protected characteristics for discrimination purposes).</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="30" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">The Government does not accept these arguments. The purpose of the proposal is to incentivise providers to scrutinise the strength of a judicial review claim before applying for legal aid to issue proceedings. Legal aid will as now remain available to enable the provider to undertake that scrutiny at the pre-action stage. In so far as the proposal is intended to target weak cases, this is a legitimate objective in the context of Article 6 ECHR, in relation to which it is well-established that a State may place limits on the availability of legal aid provision, including by reference to the prospects of success in the case. In relation to this proposal, the limitation is a proper one to encourage providers to assess the prospects before issuing proceedings, and is reasonable in that the risk that the provider bears is not linked to the ultimate outcome of the case, but to whether a court permits the case to proceed at the permission stage. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="31" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">In so far as different views may be taken by a court at the permission stage, a provider who disagrees with the refusal of permission can in an ordinary judicial review (and unless the judge certifies the case as being "totally without merit") apply for an oral renewal hearing and from there may appeal to the Court of Appeal. Taking these steps into account, it is therefore proportionate and reasonable to rely on the permission threshold as a basis upon which to limit the circumstances in which the provider will be paid for the case.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="32" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Neither does the Government accept that the proposal will have any wider chilling effect on the ability of individuals to access justice in meritorious cases. In addition to the opportunities available to a </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">provider to challenge a refusal of permission, it should be remembered that providers will still be paid in both arguable and strong cases under the proposal. First, providers will be paid in all cases which are granted permission, even if they are ultimately unsuccessful. Second, where a case settles in the claimant's favour at any stage, including prior to permission, the claimant can apply for a costs order or agree costs as part of settlement. Where costs are ordered or agreed, they will be at </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">inter </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">partes</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">rates, which are higher than legal aid rates. The courts have recently affirmed that the principle that the losing party should generally pay the winning party's litigation costs applies to public law claims, regardless of the fact that the defendant is a public body (</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">R(M) v Croydon London Borough Council </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">[2012] EWCA </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Civ</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> 595). Costs should therefore be available to a successful legal aid provider in very many cases on this basis. Finally, under the Government's revised proposal a legal aid provider who concludes a case prior to the permission stage without securing a costs order or agreement may apply to the LAA for payment at legal aid rates. The LAA will consider each case on its facts, applying a set of criteria which is subject to consultation, but which is designed to enable payment in genuinely meritorious cases. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="33" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">The Government will listen carefully to consultation responses before making its final decisions on this proposal.
