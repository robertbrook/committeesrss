The most substantial of these obligations is likely to be new rights to support for carers, though as the impact assessment accompanying the bill points out, where this expenditure enables carers to remain economically active it will yield huge benefits to the wider economy. As family carers currently provide the bulk of care and support, any reduction in the propensity of family members to care would require a proportionately larger increase in public spending to compensate. It is important that the government has the mechanisms to properly consider these wider economic impacts when deciding on funding levels for social care. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 39.6pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.6pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal">7.2.</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Other obligations in the bill include improved information and advice for people who do not meet local authority eligibility criteria, and a national system of eligibility. Age UK strongly supports both of these measures and argues that eligibility should be set at the equivalent of ‘moderate’ under the current system rather than the more restrictive ‘substantial’. Again, there are considerable longer term economic benefits in having a more inclusive system as it would result in earlier opportunities to prevent or delay the development of more intensive care needs. A study by Deloitte</span><a name="_ftnref13"></a><a href="#_ftn13">[13]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> found that funding people with moderate needs produces substantial savings for local authorities, central government and individuals</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 39.6pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.6pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal">7.3.</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">It is also important that the benefits of the proposed cap on individual care spending are not undermined by over-restrictive funding. The proposed cap is considerably higher than that proposed by the Dilnot commission and restrictive eligibility criteria will mean that people would have to spend large amounts on care before expenditure even starts to count towards the cap. These and other restrictions mean that there is a risk that implementation of the spending cap will not be perceived as fair.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';
