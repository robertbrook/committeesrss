However, we recognise the implications of operating compliantly within the EU Public Contracting Regulations make developing long term relationships with supplier difficult. Further, in most Local Authorities the responsibility for supplier management lies with teams outside of Procurement who may not have the commercial skills to perform this function. As part of the North Yorkshire Procurement Service, YPO has developed a contract management toolkit designed to help service teams understand their role in the performance management cycle, determine where their time would be best applied to manage risks whilst delivery greater value and how to structure an engagement plan with </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">suppliers to foster a culture of improvement.

We fully recognise that pressures to engage local suppliers and to stimulate local economies are both valid and unique to that Local Authority but at the same there are numerous instances where supply markets have matured to a national level and it would make sense to aggregate demand to a similar level also in order to drive greater levels of value for money. We are not suggesting a single solution would be the most appropriate answer as choice is a significant driver in obtaining best value (particularly in Care markets where personalisation is becoming an increasing driver) but in order to understand the supply market and provide a cohesive voice on the requirements of Local Government greater levels of collaboration are required.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">2.2 Fundamental to this challenge is the current lack of resource to co-ordinate collaborative activity regionally and ultimately input into national strategies.
