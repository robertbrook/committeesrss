Initiatives by UNHCR have included an ‘administration of justice’ programme centring on the role of the Thai criminal justice system, and the creation of Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) Committees in the seven ‘Karen’ camps. The largest program on access to justice has been implemented by IRC with DFID funding, which is the creation of Legal Assistance Centres (LAC). LAC provide</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">s</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> support to refugees in referring cases to the Thai legal system, responds to requests for legal advice, offers basic legal education and training to refugees, </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">and provides material and technical support to camp-based dispute resolution structures. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">LAC have operated in three camps since 2007 and in a further two camps since 2012.  </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="5" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 13.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Two particular benefits of LAC have been in providing valuable material support to a long-neglected sector and in serving as an essential liaison between refugees and the Thai criminal justice system. In its recognition of the importance of local legal empowerment as well as of strengthening refugees’ access to the Thai criminal justice system, LAC was an ambitious and forward-thinking institutional model. A project evaluation in 2010 found positive impacts of LAC in increased awareness of Thai law, in increased perceptions of fairness in decision-making at camp level and in satisfaction with case outcomes (though it is important to note that the same evaluation also found that the majority of refugees still turned to existing camp management structures as their first source of advice and assistance).</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="6" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 13.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">However, there are also areas where international involvement in the justice sector has been less successful and has perhaps even been harmful. The findings outlined below were raised in my research interviews and conversations with members of refugee-led Camp Committees, justice and security workers; staff of refugee community-based organisations; and staff of international non-governmental organisations. Indicating the seriousness and sensitivity of these questions, both international staff and refugees were only willing to speak about these issues with a guarantee of anonymity. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">The model of justice reform </span></p><ol start="7" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 13.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">IRC-LAC currently operates in five camps but for the first five years of its operation was present in only one of the seven ‘Karen’ camps on the border. This has had implications for equitable service delivery and for the capacity building objectives of its work. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">It has also had implications for consistent policy advice to refugees. In the camps where LAC is present, IRC is the primary avenue of external contact and advice on justice matters. Where LAC is not present, UNHCR is the lead agency on these issues. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Lack of political will from a host government is a classic problem of international law reform programmes. However, in the context of the refugee camps in Thailand, resistance to LAC’s legal empowerment agenda seems to have primarily originated from within UNHCR. In April 2012, I interviewed camp staff and community organisations from four of the five camps where LAC was operational; all of whom described receiving conflicting advice from IRC-LAC staff and from UNHCR staff on crucial issues, including the types of cases that could be resolved at camp level and the permitted use of detention in camps. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="8" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 13.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">For refugees, the difficulties caused by this lack of agreement between UNHCR and IRC-LAC staff were compounded by the familiar development-sector problem of staff turnover and rotation which constantly changed relationships between INGOs and refugees and changed the emphasis given to different dimensions of justice programming. LAC’s original model for justice reform gave equal weight to enhancing refugees’ access to the Thai criminal justice system and strengthening capacity for camp-based dispute resolution. The opinion of several of my interviewees was that the legal empowerment dimension of LACs work has come to be secondary to its engagement on and with the Thai criminal justice system. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Access to Thai courts </span></p><ol start="9" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 13.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Access to national courts is extremely important for </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">refugees, and indeed is a right under the 1951 Refugee Convention (which the Royal Thai Government has not signed or ratified). However, refugees face particular challenges in accessing national courts, for a variety of reasons including unfamiliar language, lack of freedom of movement and a lack of institutional literacy and knowledge. Refugees are in a position of relative powerlessness and vulnerability and understandably fear that engaging with national authorities may have negative consequences, potentially even deportation. For all of these reasons, external assistance (such as that provided by LAC) is an essential bridge in facilitating refugees’ access to the Thai criminal justice system.  </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="10" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">In camps where LAC is present, many more cases are being sent to the Thai criminal justice system than in the past. While this is broadly positive, there are more problematic dimensions that are not immediately obvious. First, not all cases that are ‘sent out of camp’ are accepted by Thai police. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">In all the camps that I conducted interviews in, respondents </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">described cases being refused by the Thai authorities and sent b</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ack to the camps to deal with. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Camp leaders and justice staff were unclear as to how they should respond in such cases, with the result that </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">they </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">were going unpunished. (</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">I</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">t is also worth noting here that the vast majority of problems occurring in the camps are not serious crimes but minor disputes; confusion regarding permitted camp-based responses risks </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">reducing the confidence of camp staff to conduct the low-level </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">dispute resolution that is required </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">for </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">such cases.) </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="11" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">A second important caveat relates to the types of cases that are being processed in Thai courts.  LAC provided me with statistics of cases in Thai courts from the inception of the programme until April 2011. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">In 2010 (the last full year that I have statistics for),</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> from Ban Mai Nai Soi and Ban Mae Surin, 73 cases were in the Thai justice system.

For UNHCR, this was the creation of Sexual and Gender Based Violence Committees in the seven ‘Karen’ camps.  These Committees were created in the first instance as an education and awareness-raising tool but their remit was later extended to establish the Committees as the lead agency in SGBV case management. This role was resisted by some refugee leaders as it was perceived to place the SGBV Committees in opposition to existing services that were operated by the primary refugee-led women’s organisation, the Karen Women Organisation. In one camp, Umpiem Mai, relations deteriorated to the extent that in 2010 the Camp Committee expelled the SGBV Committee from the camp.  A series of emergency meetings were held between refugee leaders and NGOs to resolve the issue. Three years later, the existence and role of SGBV Committees continues to be opposed by the Karen Women Organisation. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="13" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">A prominent programme by IRC-LAC was to conduct a ‘law reform’ that would clarify camp rules, jurisdiction and procedures.  After more than three years, this project had not circulated even a draft document. Participants in this process attributed the delay to a combination of IRC-LAC staff turnover and to UNHCR opposition. At the outset, the process was called ‘Law Reform’.  UNHCR staff objected that that this was tantamount to creating a parallel legal system in violation of Thai sovereignty, and the process was renamed as Developing Mediation and Legal Standards.  Again, UNHCR staff considered this to be too close to ‘law’ and another name change was requested, to ‘Mediation and Dispute Resolution Guidelines’. These Guidelines were finally circulated to refugee community organisations in August 2013.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">              </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="14" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The SGBV Committees and the Law Reform process have complex histories </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">that </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">cannot be fully explained without lengthy detail.

Camp-based refugees may find it difficult to challenge host-country nationals – and this may be the case even if there is ostensibly a shared ethnic identity. For the success of a programme, refugee staff should be seen as much more than interpreters but as crucial intermediaries and cultural knowledge brokers. For this reason, it is important that people in this role are already recognised community leaders with some authority and popular support. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="20" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Recognising that the support of local actors is essential to the success of programming suggests that significant efforts should be made to map existing community activities to identify where international agencies can make the most effective contribution. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">I</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">t may be that the mos</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">t valuable contribution will be </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">material support to existing community-led programmes. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Community mapping should seek to identify existing programmes; to determine </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">which organisation and individuals possess</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> popular support and legitimacy;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> and to </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">identify </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">community priorities and concerns</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> to establish where these agree with or diverge from those of NGOs</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">.  </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="21" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">As funders, DFID have a vital role to play. Access to justice programming cannot be done effectively on a short-term basis. If objectives for reform have been established and buy-in has been secured from key stakeholders, it must be recognised that this is a long-term intervention and funded and staffed appropriately. Many damaging dynamics of justice programming in Thailand </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">and elsewhere can be related to </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">funding insecurity, including high staff turnover and reliance on short-term volunteers to conduct sensitive and challenging protection work. Some staff turnover is inevitable but it is essential that the overarching goals of a project are sufficiently well defined and established that they are not reinvented with each change in personnel. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="22" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">An additional advantage of committing to long-term funding support is that it allows implementing agencies to focus on developing the most effective programmes rather than on presenting the most persuasive case for funding.  Inevitably, some programme activities will be more successful than others. Long-term funding permits confident decision-making about which aspects to emphasise – and, perhaps, which to abandon.  As a related point, evaluations and any publications resulting from an evaluation should be genuinely independent of implementing agencies. Given the complexity of understanding local justice systems, it would be beneficial for evaluators to also have a long-term commitment, revisiting projects repeatedly over a sustained period to fully appreciate and understand their local impact.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">October 2013</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div><hr style="width:33%; height:1px; text-align:left" /><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn1"></a><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt"> The statistics were provided to me as a pie-chart with a total number of cases and a percentage breakdown: Illegal presence 66%; rape of a minor 7%; physical harm/assault 4%; other 3%; fraud 4%; forestry offences 5%;domestic violence 1%; assisting illegal presence 1%; arson 1%; accidental death 1%; vehicle accident 1%; threat of physical harm 1%; theft 4%; taking child away from parents 1%. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="_ftn2"></a><a href="#_ftnref2">[2]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt"> Illegal presence 33%; murder 2%; other 14%; physical harm/assault 3%; physical harm/grievous bodily harm 1%; rape 1%; rape of a minor 16%; suicide 1%; theft 4%; vehicle accident 5%; accidental death 4%; attempted murder 1%; child abuse 2%; drug trafficking 1%; drug use 1%; forestry offence 11%.</span></p></body></html>
