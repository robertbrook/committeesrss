Another important path is seeking to facilitate a smoother transition from education to work, while some interventions strive to increase the employability of young people. The problem today across Europe is the lack of coordination among different schemes and programmes and their links with the existing legislation and other important measures such as labour incentives and industrial policies plans. The EU youth guarantee is a scheme that tries for the first time to coordinate all those actions while also promoting a cultural shift in the way how we design active employment policies for young people. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">4. </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Are the EU’s accounting, monitoring and evaluation procedures sufficient to be able to determine whether EU funded projects to tackle youth unemployment have been successful or not?

How might any negative consequences be mitigated? </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Several Member States have already implemented measures to support the integration of young migrant workers into the labour market. Generally, young Europeans who move to another Member State to find work are highly motivated and may also be well educated and trained, but this should not exclude them from programmes aimed at getting young people into work. In particular, young migrant workers may not always know their employment rights in the country to which they have moved, and can thus be vulnerable to exploitation by unscrupulous employers, for example being paid less than the minimum wage or (unknowingly) doing undeclared work. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">In addition, it can be necessary to undertake targeted action for those young people from an immigrant background who suffer the problems of early exit from education and long term unemployment.

One example of this could be for the UK to use online resources and social media to promote EU funded programmes such as ERASMUS, which enables students to spend a part of their course at a university in another European country, or LEONARDO, which offers graduates the possibility of doing a paid internship in another European country. Such programmes are able to provide young people with essential practical and intercultural skills, which are often more valuable than exam results to employers working in a globalised economy. Recent British Council research lamented that that “fewer than 2% of UK students are studying abroad, despite the opportunities it provides."</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">21 October 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
