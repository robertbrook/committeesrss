We concluded that carers’ electronic monitoring record should be the main source of evidence for missed visits, poor timing and too frequent changes of carer and that, where user opinion was apparently unavoidable, care should be taken that the sample of users approached would be drawn from those most at risk of poor care. In April 2012, after reading an article by the Care Quality Commission’s Director of Regulatory Development about the Domiciliary Care themed inspection, we felt that the Commission’s approach to inspection could be improved in the same way and asked for a place on its lay advisory committee where I continued to urge these points until the group was disbanded on January 31</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:7.33pt; vertical-align:super">st</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> 2013.
