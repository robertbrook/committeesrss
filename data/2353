The intention to omit the "other" it is believed would strengthen Sub-Section (b) regardless whether Sub-Section (a) were removed or retained.  However, the inter-relationship between the two Sub-Sections is acknowledged.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Referring to Clause 48 Ambulatory References to International Shipping Instruments to insert after Section 306 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, Section 306 A the power to make Ambulatory References to International Instruments appears an entirely sensible procedure so as to facilitate the introduction and implementation of International Instruments. This potentially can save a burdensome legislative and consultative process since amendments to International Instruments are obligatory, particularly where there has been the adoption of the 'tacit acceptance procedure', and are therefore obligatory. Such processes are used by other countries with considerable beneficial effect, including the early implementation of International Instruments.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Allan Graveson</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Senior National Secretary</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">13 September 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
