line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">My father was killed in 1979 by a lorry turning left into his path at traffic lights.  I was young at the time, but I understand now that the inquest suggested my father had arrived at the lights before the lorry, intending to go straight on, and that the lorry driver had “lost” my father in the blind spot to the left of his vehicle.</span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">I will not, I think, have to record for the committee the grief suffered by my mother for the past 34 years for this split second lapse by the lorry driver, nor the burden that he, a good man whom we knew, had to endure for the rest of his days.</span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt"> I have, for obvious reasons, kept a track on cycling safety issues since that time, and I am of course pained by the six very recent deaths on London roads.    I no longer live in London, but I have always, as my father, been a keen cyclist, and know London’s roads very well, and feel I may have something to contribute to your ongoing inquiry from the point of view of the law-abiding but observant cyclist.  I make my points as briefly as possible:</span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">1) I do not have figures  for the percentage of cycling fatalities which are caused by lorries turning to the left, with cyclists caught in the blind spot, and cyclists then left with “nowhere to go” other than under the lorry’s wheels.  You may wish to ascertain the percentage of all fatalities who die in this way from experts appearing  to give evidence, if indeed there are such figures available.  However, my own review of newspaper accounts of fatalities over the last few years, along with observation of many near misses on London and other roads, would suggest to me that the percentage is very high.  In turn, this would suggest that priority should be given to this specific problem.</span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">2) One such solution comes in the form of draft legislation already laid before parliament, albeit via a private members’ bill.  This is the Road Safety Traffic Bill 2011, which recommends that the law be changed to:</span></p><p style="line-height:12.75pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7.5pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">a) require the fitting of equipment to heavy goods vehicles to eliminate driver </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">blindspots</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt"> and aid driver awareness of cyclists, pedestrians and other road users in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle;</span></p><p style="line-height:12.75pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7.5pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">(b) make other regulations to ensure drivers are trained in using safety equipment as fitted to their vehicles, to improve the safety of cyclists, pedestrians and other road users.</span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">I would ask that the Committee inquire as to why this draft bill got so much support from a wide range of MPs, and then consider whether it is worth taking forward its provisions by another legislative route.  This would of </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">of</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt"> course require investment, but  as I noted at the time Alan Leith MP brought the bill before the House, </span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt"><span style="background-color:#ffffff; font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">2,500 cyclists are killed or badly injured every year.</span><span style="background-color:#ffffff;

font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">3) While the inves</span><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="background-color:#ffffff; font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">tment proposed by Alan Leith makes sense, the actions of the Metropolitan Police in the wake of the six fatalities do not.  Far from bringing about safer cycling conditions, the police’s decision to clamp down on the jumping of red lights brings with it the risk of even more fatalities.</span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="background-color:#ffffff; font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">Let me take this back to my father’s last experience, and quote from a piece that I wrote yesterday:</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff; line-height:12.75pt; margin:0pt 0pt 7.5pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">Had my dad jumped a red light on his way home from work on December 11th 1979,</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">he’d probably have lived quite a lot longer. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">As it was, he was a very law abiding man, and </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">- as far </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">as we know from the </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">inquesed</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">– he positioned himself precisely at the white stop line, planning then to proceed straightforward towards his tea. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">A few seconds later, the lorry came up on his right and, when the lights turned to green, said lorry turned left, my dad had nowhere to go, and that was that – other than the 34 years of grief my mother has lived through, and the pain and guilt that the lorry driver </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">(a good man, everyone new everyone in Eccles in those days) took to his own grave.</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff;

font-size:10pt">I’ve ridden the streets of London a lot (though not so much since I moved back up north), and THE key reason cyclists position themselves is advance of red lights, or “jump” them where, at tight corners or where there are pedestrian crossings (there’s something about positioning the other side of these which is just</span><span style="font-family:Arial;

font-size:10pt">obviously naughty to you average polite cyclist) is that it’s much safer to do that than risk being turned into, with nowhere to go other than under the wheels. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">If you’ve noticed London’s roads at all, the pavements tend to be pretty high from the roadside, and are not jumpable on a bike, especially if you’re in clips – it’s the kind of thing experienced cyclists pick up, sometimes subconsciously).</span></p><p style="background-color:#ffffff;

font-size:10pt">Perhaps the problem – to be charitable to the police – is that safety first approach to cycling has developed its own</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic">habitus</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">, whereby not even cyclists recognise the legitimacy of their positioning – it’s just what cyclists do in London, and if you’re all kitted out in </span><span style="font-family:Arial;

font-size:10pt">that non-cycling police officers and others might interpret red-light passing as cyclist arrogance. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Arial;
