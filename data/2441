Although lengthy, the MLC consultation process, co-ordinated by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, was absolutely essential in understanding the scope and impact of the Convention on UK law and UK seafarers, as well as identifying those parts of the Convention that the Government/MCA has interpreted.
