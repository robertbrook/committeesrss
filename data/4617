The Steiner Academy Hereford (SAH) was the first publicly funded Steiner school in the UK. It was established in 2008as a conversion from an independent school.    It is an all-though academy to 16 with capacity for 330 pupils. From the outset about one third of pupils have been on the academy’s SEN register. Also from the outset demand has outstripped supply with the academy having to hold waiting lists for all its year groups.  In 2011 the Steiner Academy </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Frome</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> (SAF) was opened, with places for young children only, but with a plan to grow to become an all-through academy from 4-16 with 624 places by 2020. In Sept 2012 another Steiner academy opened in Exeter, with similar limited provision to begin with and a plan to grow to offer two-form entry from 4 - 16.  A fourth Steiner academy is due to open in Bristol next September. The level of parental demand for a place in the Steiner Academies is high and so far the evidence is that demand outstrips supply.  Demand data for Steiner Academies that are being proposed also are significantly </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">high.Given</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> that there is concern that some approved Free Schools proposals are not able to match their demand survey with an ability to fill all their places when they open, </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">it should be noted that demand for Steiner education seems to translate into a new Steiner Academy being able to fill its places as soon as it opens. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">1.04</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The supply of suitably qualified teachers and leaders is a challenge for us.
