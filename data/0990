font-size:11pt">a marked tendency to use climate change as an umbrella term for a number of other environmental issues such as pollution and</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> population growth.  There is a widespread</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> causal connection with climate change and the ozone layer.  For example, in our research, the ozone layer was associated with climate change with far greater frequency than, say, CO2 em</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">i</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">ssions.  </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The most frequently made association across our sample </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';

font-size:11pt"> which shows that awareness and self-reported knowledge of climate change has been rising over the last two decades.  However a confusion of depletion of the ozone layer with climate change, for example, has remained fairly consistent in this time</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';

font-size:11pt"> and credibility</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> in relation to sources of information on climate science and policy is a complex process in an environment in which there are multiple voices engaged in the debate across a range of media.  We found that television news is still the first place that people hear about what is happening in the world</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">though they </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">sometimes </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">follow TV reports with independent research on the internet in order to provide clarity or to substantiate what has been reported. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> In this sense, credibility is weighed up in relation to consistency of information and the accountability of the individual speaker.  However, we found that the BBC, across media, remains a highly trusted source –</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">it was felt to be the least partial, and most serious about addressing the issues.  </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">9. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">A further group to which a high level of trust was attributed was the scientists, academics and other experts – speakers who are </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">directly involved in research, and possessed of the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">expertise and knowledge which other sources such as journalists and television producers would draw on</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> in producing media accounts</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">.  However, in spite of the trust invested in the scien</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">tists and other experts, questions were raised about the validity of the science of climate change.  There were two aspects to this: the first is the suggestion that the arguments around climate change are theoretical and cannot be easily proved or disproved, and the second is that, as a result, the scientists contradict each other and there is a lack of consistency within the science community.  </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">We found that, without prompting, participants rarely referred to the existence of any consensus amongst the scientists, although a recent survey showed that 97% of peer-reviewed scientific papers agree that man-made climate change is happening</span><a name="_ednref2"></a><a href="#_edn2">[ii]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">.  Instead the perceived </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">‘woolly’ nature of the evidence led to a belief that the science was open to interpretation</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">.  It was further widely believed that </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">a range of speakers, such as politicians and representatives from the business community, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">interpreted the science </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">to meet their own agendas</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">.  </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The view that media coverage was agenda-led - and, in the extreme, mere ‘propaganda’ </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">- </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">was widely expressed. </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">10. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Politicians were most named </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">(by 28%) </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">as the source not to be trusted on climate change, which reflected a wider sense of distrust and cynicism about public figures in general.  The expenses scandal of 2009 was cited as a key reason for this, but broken manifesto pledges and the lack of attention paid to public protests were also mentioned.  The lack of trust in political players in general was transferred to their handling of climate change and implementation of policy.  </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The low level of public trust combined with the belief in the lack of solidity of the scientific evidence led to difficulty in knowing who to trust, which our research showed had a direct impact on levels of engagement with the issue.  </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">11. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">In view of the role of Government Departments and members of the scientific community in communicating climate science, it is our strong belief that there should be a shift </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">in focus </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">with the latter taking a more public role and propelling the arguments forward in the public sphere.  </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The arguments need to be contextualised by the scientific knowledge, de-politicised and presented as evidence-based rather than as conjecture.  </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">There are however difficulties associated with this.  Firstly that the science is complex and journalists struggle to find ways to engage audiences which is, of course, their primary concern.  Further, partially as a result of this aim, the media have often drawn </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">on ‘experts’ </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">- sometimes called climate sceptics - </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">without the appropriate credentials to speak on climate science </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">to fuel debate</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">.  </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">There is evidence that these sceptics are a well organised and well funded group with the aim of discrediting climate science and downplaying the need for action</span><a name="_ednref3"></a><a href="#_edn3">[iii]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> – as a result they are vocal in publicising their views.  This stands in contrast to </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">climate scientists and other experts in the area of climate change who are reluctant to do so.  </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">However if the scientists developed high </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">profile public roles, it </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">would reduce the capacity for the sceptics to challenge their credibility.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">  This would make it simpler for audiences to identify tho</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">se sources of trust and to focus on accurate information.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">  </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Our research also showed the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">importance of the reinforcement of media messages</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> suggesting a key part of building these public roles is to be prolific in spreading their knowledge.  </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">12. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The role of the p</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">olitical speakers in this process lies in their agenda-setting powers.  In recent years an equal if not more significant problem in climate change communications is that there has not </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">been enough of it.  Since 2010 </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">there has been a global and national decline in the coverage of climate change</span><a name="_ednref4"></a><a href="#_edn4">[iv]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> and our research showed that this impacts on the public’s sense of it being a pressing problem.  Simply if it is in the news, it is more likely to be thought of as a priority and to play on people’s minds.  This decline is due to a number of factors but one reason is that the media </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">take their lead from the official sources upon which they are reliant on for their information.  Politicians are the most significant of this group. The BBC, in particular, sets its agenda on the basis of the political debate as a key aspect of its role is to present the range of views in a democracy in which parliament is seen to represent the will of the people.  In essence therefore the boundaries of parliamentary debate form the core of the political arguments which it features.  </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Climate change has not been a major priority of the </span><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">coalition government – and</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> the dissent over climate change and related issues was exposed through the internal conflict over the Energy Bill and the lack of promotion of the latter </span><span style="background-color:#ffffff;

font-size:11pt">Whilst we would argue the scientists should take centre stage in the coverage, it therefore lies</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> with the politicians to </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">open up the </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">media landscape.  </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Politicians </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';

font-size:11pt"> and independent experts, such as engineers, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">as a unified group who are arguing the case for evidence-based policy.  Central to this is the communicative relationship between scientists, Government Departments and journalis</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">ts from the full range of media, but the evidence must be seen to be coming from the scientists.  In relation to the aforementioned difficulties that journalists face in covering as complex an issue as climate change, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';

font-size:11pt">cynicism about </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">public figures, and resultant feelings of distrust, found in our research indicates that initiatives which rely on voluntary behavioural changes are unlikely to be widely engaged with.  However, we did find in our groups, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';

font-size:11pt">broader systemic issues</span><a name="_ednref5"></a><a href="#_edn5">[v]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">.  But whilst these issues are clearly significant – people are unlikely to take up cycling to work without the protection of a network of cycle lanes - we argue this does </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">not sufficiently account for the way the media shape possibilities within those bounds.  </span><span style="color:#1f497d; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The range of the work of the Glasgow University Media group has showed the conditions under which new information produced sometimes radical changes in behaviour – for example, in our work on HIV/AIDS, we analysed the differing effects of the government campaign on changes in condom use and sexual behaviour.  The link between smoking and cancer has also clearly produced substantial behavioural change.  But there are also examples in which new information does not produce such changes and the literature illustrates that information on climate change often fails to do so.  Our research would strongly suggest that one of the reasons is that the information in the area of climate change is so widely contested that there is no simple understanding which could lead to engagement with or without all the other cultural and social considerations.</span><span style="color:#ff0000;
