Thank you very much for coming to give evidence. We are very grateful to all three of you. Can I begin with a straightforward question that may not necessarily have a straightforward answer? Of course, the financial services industry is particularly important to the UK—we have got two-thirds of the wholesale markets in Europe—and much more important to us even than, say, the car industry is to the Germans or agriculture is to the French or the Italians. What is it that we think Brussels can do for us and do to help our industry compete globally, and what is it that they are doing that is getting in the way? Why don’t I start with Dr Lyons and then go to Jim O’Neill and then Sir Nigel?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Love:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You have drawn the short straw.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Lyons</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Good afternoon. It is a pleasure to be here. In terms of the City, I would differentiate between the retail sector and the wholesale sector. Often, the complaints I hear or worries about </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> come more from the retail side than from the wholesale side. I am not an expert on this, so I am looking at it from a macroeconomic perspective and I might miss some of the fine detail, but my understanding is that the problem we had in monetary policy, which is one size does not fit all, seems very much to apply in the retail sector, which is why there is a lot of noise around there and why there is a need to differentiate between the different structures of the retail markets across Europe. The essence is: Europe is trying to say what is required to make life better for the consumer in terms of better and best protection, but what seems to be happening is that Europe is pushing directives, not regulations, so things are being imposed on a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> retail sector that is far more advanced than on the continent. There are about 4 million </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> consumers who save, invest or are involved in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> retail financial sector, and I would imagine that the message they are constantly bombarded with is that they are being hit by further regulations from </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. From the European side, there is the need to differentiate across the retail consumer sectors.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">From the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> perspective, it seems to me that we are very good tactically—I would apply this to the wholesale sector as well as the retail sector—by which I mean that we are very good at fire-fighting or responding to problems as they are arising. I am not sure we are as good strategically in terms of being involved at an early stage of the process to influence the debate as much as we can.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The final point on the retail side—again, I am not an expert—is that just from reading the financial press and talking to people in the City, the whole idea of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">passporting</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> comes up. Some of the big problems that have cost the UK industry, asset managers, life insurance maybe but certainly the retail side, are things that have been </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">passported</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in from Luxembourg. Because they are in the EU, their regulation applies to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, so there is the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">passporting</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> issue as well. In a nutshell, there are a lot of micro things, but it is effectively the same issue we had on the monetary policy side, which is one size does not fit all, and bringing that down and recognising that there is a difference.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In terms of the wholesale financial sector, Open Europe have pointed out a figure that is regularly quoted, so I am quoting it second hand, which is that services account for about three-quarters of the European economy, but in terms of the exports and imports within the internal market, services only constitute about a quarter of the economy. The point from the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> side that you usually hear is that we need to make the single market work properly.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The way I tend to see it is that we can think about almost four different aspects, one of which is non-economic, which is foreign affairs and all those issues. Park that to one side, and then you have three different aspects. There is the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">eurozone</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, of which we are not a part. Then there is the single market—a single market in terms of the four freedoms and the core competencies, with the Cabinet Office and so on looking at this. That is where people want things to work properly, making the single market work properly. Then there are the other economic issues, of which there is a lot clubbed together in there. That, it seems, leads to a lot of regulation. What people want in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is to make the single market work properly, particularly within financial services.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Just to conclude because we can take this further, and obviously my colleagues have a lot more to say than I, the other issue is the relationship between the EZ and the non-EZ, i.e. the relationship between the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">eurozone</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, the EZ group, and the non-</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">eurozone</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> group. This is work in motion, shall we say? We need probably to be engaging as much as the continent. It seems to me that we approach this very much from an economic and financial issue, whereas the continent maybe approaches it from a political issue. Therefore, we need to have greater clarity about where we stand at the beginning of the process. In terms of the EZ and the non-EZ group, it is about how that relationship would work in the future, including between the Bank of England and the European Central Bank. To conclude, there is the whole issue about engagement as well, so there is a whole host of broad issues and micro issues.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We want to explore those in more detail, but let us just get a quick further view from Mr O’Neill and then Sir Nigel Wicks.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jim O'Neill</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Okay. Thank you also for inviting me here. Can I just make clear that in talking on all these matters, because sometimes people forget, I left Goldman Sachs seven months ago? I am no longer at Goldman Sachs or Goldman Sachs Asset Management. In that regard, I might have a different view on some issues than they might. I am certainly not here representing Goldman Sachs, although obviously having had 20 years there I am influenced by my experiences having been there as well as other things.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I guess I have maybe two and a half or three comments. First of all, like Gerard, I would also make a distinction at the start but in a slightly different way of doing it than he suggested. I would distinguish between British banks and the City. Frequently, in so many areas that this Committee and others have engaged in and opined on over the past interesting years, it seems to me that quite often that gets lost. I say that because if I think of your specific question, your exact question, I think maybe there are some things to be learnt from the continent, if not necessarily Brussels, about how our banks engage with the rest of the economies. I often think the nature of how the German banking system has developed historically, particularly the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Landesbanks</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Sparkassens</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in the function of some kind of national post-war regional development; they see their role as being part of a broader economic community and are not quite so motivated as perhaps some of our banks have become. I do not know whether there is a great deal to be learnt from </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Brussels</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in that regard, but there may be some things to be learnt from parts of the continent.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Against that, and going to what I hear as the tone of your question—maybe that is just me reading things into it—I do not know what can be learnt because, as you also implied, emphasising the importance of financial services for this country, in a global sense there are not many sectors of life where Europe has that expertise for the world as the City does for the UK and Europe. They should think a lot more carefully about some of the consequences of their decisions.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Why I say two and a half, it seems to me, touching on an aspect that I thought of while Gerard was </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">talking,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> a lot of the decisions in the past three-plus years are basically being driven to ensure the survival of the euro, not necessarily in the greater interests of the EU and all its members, in my opinion.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I am going to move on to Sir Nigel because we will get more detail on all of these, but just a quick response as well, anything that you want to add.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Nigel Wicks</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes. Going to your question, I think you have to start from the fundamental point about what the purpose is of financial services. The purpose of financial services is to provide a service to individual consumers—retail—and businesses, which is a retail but also a wholesale. To answer your question, what we want from the European Union as far as British citizens are concerned, is a financial services framework that helps us serve the consumer and serve the business community.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q2 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Okay. Well, are we getting it, and in what ways are we not getting it? That is my question.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Nigel Wicks</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Well, I think the answer is up to a point, if I might put it that way. I think to an extent we are. Take, for example, the key fundamental, which is financial stability. Some few years ago the G20 set out a programme for achieving financial stability. Virtually all that programme is being delivered through the European Union. We have our own things that we are doing in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—for example, the John Vickers proposal and all those—but a great deal is coming from the European Union. That is something that is absolutely essential and it is right that it is done on a continental basis, the whole of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, because if there are problems in one member state, with contagion and the linkages between the banks they can so easily spread. One of the things that they are doing to help is trying to get a financially stable situation in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Not everything they are doing is helping. In this country, in the financial services area here, in the wholesale, it is a global business. You can tell that if you go round many of the large foreign investment banks in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. They have their global heads for EMEA—that is the European, Middle East and Africa region—in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. Sometimes, what comes out of the European Union is not helpful for the banks in the City of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> penetrating new markets abroad. I will give you two examples.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes, give us two quick examples.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Nigel Wicks</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: One of the things that the Commission is much enamoured with is the concept of equivalence: that is, before you allow businesses established within the European Union to operate in a third country, that third country has to have arrangements for clearing houses, CCPs, that sort of thing, equivalent to what we have here. That is asserting a sort of extraterritoriality, saying, “Our banks can go up there provided you have the same standards as ours.” That can be unhelpful and in some parts of the world they do not much like it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Another quick example—and this is a rather controversial example but I will nevertheless make it—is you can make a good case, though some people would dispute it, for the proposals on bonuses and bonus caps that have come out of CRD IV. However, it starts to cause problems for European banks—I am talking about not just British banks, but banks right across the whole European Union—when they are applied to subsidiaries of European Union banks in third countries when they are not applied to the non-European banks that are their competitors. For example, and I simply make it up, take </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Santander</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> as a European bank operating in Rio or </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Sao Paulo</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: its people there are caught by the bonus cap, whereas JP Morgan or </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Citi</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> operating there is not. There is anecdotal evidence that that is inhibiting the European banks operating in those jurisdictions.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Okay, helpful examples. I think we are going to need to get into more detail.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q3 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jesse Norman:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Can I just ask you, Dr Lyons, if you can give us a quick sense of the geography of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> from a financial standpoint? Who are our allies among the Euro-bureaucracy and who are our enemies, as you see it from a City of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> perspective?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Lyons</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Thanks for the question. I do not think there is any right or wrong answer to that and it is very difficult to quantify the answer. Let me approach it in two different ways.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I think the key issue facing Europe, including the UK, is how we reposition ourselves in a changing and growing global economy, which is why the last point Sir Nigel mentioned about the third party is key. Within that, the key issue is where the financial sector and the City stand. The City is Europe’s financial centre, so in relation to the size of the European economy the City is not that big, but in relation to the size of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> economy it is huge, hence all the problems we saw in the crisis. That is the first point.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The second point follows from that. Coming back to that, I think we need to position how the financial sector is seen within the overall economic picture and within the overall economic aim. Now, as Jim O’Neill touched on, a lot of the issues in the last few years on the continent have been more about fire-fighting—he did not use those words, but it is about protecting the euro and protecting the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">eurozone</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in particular. Given all that, my view is that all of the euro area should be our allies if we present the case right for the importance of a good financial centre: good to service the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, good to service the continent, good to position us. The reality, however, is that we are some way from that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">If we look at it in terms of which countries might be trying to force reform within </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, in generic terms not just in financial terms, the Dutch over this year seemed to, and the Swedes have. The Germans seem very keen on reform but they are approaching it more, I would say, initially from ensuring that the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">eurozone</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> itself is strong. There are a number of coalitions or potential economies that should or could come together in terms of the reform process.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The other aspect is that, given where we are at the moment, the non-</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">eurozone</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> members should be our natural allies. I am sure you are aware that the two countries that have said that they will not join the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">eurozone</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> are </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Denmark</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. All other countries are obliged to join it. At the moment, as things stand, that group should be our natural allies. The other people who should be our natural allies are the people who want to reform the European area. Beyond all that, if it is about repositioning </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, then we should all pretty much be in the same position. It is very much coming back to Sir Nigel’s point about how you position the financial sector as helping the economy.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q4 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jesse Norman:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Where does the Commission fit into this and where does the ECB fit into this?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Lyons</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I am not sure, is the answer to that. The ECB is, as I see it, very much there to ensure that the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">eurozone</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is doing well. A banking union has yet to fully develop so there are lots of issues there in terms of fiscal issues, not just normal monetary issues. In terms of your previous question about allies, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank need to develop further the clarity about how things will behave between the non-</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">eurozone</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> economies and the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">eurozone</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> economies. That is seen as an important bit within the City. The ECB has played a fantastic role on the continent in the last 18 months.

Sir Nigel, are there particular segments of the financial services area where you think the City holds a particular comparative advantage?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Nigel Wicks</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes. One is that we hold a particular comparative advantage because in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> we do such a lot of things that there are cross-synergies. Because we can offer a complete package, that is a very big comparative advantage. If you go to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Dublin</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> or </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Luxembourg</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, they are great for funds, but in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> you can offer the whole range of services in whatever currency you want; we have lawyers in the City who will write whatever contract you want and whatever law you want. That is the great advantage of the City. In some sense, it is one of our risks, one of our danger points, because if we start contracting and start losing some of these important elements to the total package, it weakens the City as a whole. I am therefore very pleased that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is making great efforts to get the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">renminbi</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> market in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. We hear talk of an Islamic bond being issued here in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. That is working, in my view, in entirely the right direction because it is broadening the portfolio of products and services that we can offer and, therefore, improving the position of the City in its entirety.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q6 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jesse Norman:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> If you were doing an economic analysis, you might take the view there are some areas we should not be playing in because we are never going to be a low quality, low price, mass volume player in some areas.

Jim O’Neill, do you think that some of the recent relative falls in the ratings of the City of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> have been due to the many reputational issues that our banks have faced over the last three to five years?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Nigel Wicks</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: That is undoubtedly a contributory factor. It is not the only factor but it is a contributory factor. It is in the interests of the City, of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> financial market, the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> financial market, that we are seen to have a palpably honest, open, transparent and fair financial market. Certain of the things that have happened in recent years have not demonstrated that. There is work to be done to demonstrate it and it will take several years to demonstrate that we have that sort of market. But there are other reasons why we may have slipped down this index.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q8 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jesse Norman:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We will come on to those. Let me just ask Jim O’Neill quickly if he wants to comment on my question about reputational damage.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jim O'Neill</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I just want to be sure. Are you asking in terms of our reputation in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Brussels</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> or our general reputation?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jesse Norman:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Generally. Obviously, we are thinking about </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> particularly at the moment, but essentially undermining our claims to—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jim O'Neill</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Even though you did not ask me this, I want to precede this by also quickly answering you about comparative advantages. I have always jokingly said the biggest threat to the City would be if </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">New York</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> changed its time zone by five hours. We have incredibly important simple things that are impossible for anybody else to compete with: the time zone, the language, and a hugely deep, skilled and flexible pool of labour.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">By the way, in all the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">rantings</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and ravings about the City—I am going to come to your other question—it is frequently forgotten that I think for the past 30 years it has contributed about 2% of GDP invisible surplus, without which we could have had some severe balance of payments problems. There are very few parts of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> that could do that for such a long period.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Obviously, there have been events over the past five years that have damaged the reputation as such, but, as difficult as the interplay between real damage and a desire to seem populist and to blame is, the previous points I made need to not be forgotten because they are hugely important advantages that we have for this massively growing global industry that are not so easy to find in other parts of life here. In my opinion, a lot of the problems are because of issues about the regulatory environment that has presided over how the City has evolved, not necessarily a genuine reflection of how the hundreds of thousands of people that work in the City behave.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q9 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Jesse Norman:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Can I ask one final question, Chairman? Just back to Sir Nigel, if, as you suggest, some of these scandals have undermined our credibility with these European institutions, do you think there are offsetting factors that we can look forward to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">to</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> restore our </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">position? Is there a danger that the European countries or institutions may start ganging up against </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Britain</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and using that lack of legitimacy from those scandals as a cause of action?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Nigel Wicks</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Well, there undoubtedly are people in the mainland of Europe, as there are no doubt in this country, who are antipathetic to a free, open market, properly regulated financial business, and they will use these scandals that have happened in the debate against the sort of business that goes on in the City. We will have to combat that by pointing out the arguments in the opposite direction, but the best way of combating it is to show that these very unfortunate episodes have taken place in the past, and we are working very hard and hopefully with some success to prevent that in the future.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The other point, which is a wider point we must get across and has been touched upon by my two colleagues, is that the City is not only a benefit to the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> it is a real benefit to the European Union. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> will always exist in terms of a financial </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">market,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> it will always exist in some form or other, but say it did not exist. Where else in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> would it be? Now, I have respect for Paris, I have respect for Frankfurt, but I for one moment do not see them being able to replicate what we have in London. The services that the mainland members of the European Union call upon in the wholesale financial markets, they would not be able to get in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">; they would have to go wider abroad for that. We must continually make the case—and we have to do it with a voice of some humility, which we are not always very good at doing—that the financial markets in this country are there to serve the interests not just of the UK but of the citizens of Europe as a whole.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Lyons</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Can I just make two very quick points?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Very quickly, and then I am going to bring in John Mann.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Lyons</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The first point is in the context of your question about friends and allies. One of the concerns in the City is the whole change in the voting structure, which comes into effect next year. The point made, for instance, is that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">France</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has effectively a veto to protect its agricultural sector, whereas we do not really have anything to protect the City. The change in voting structure, which is based, as I understand it, on the population because of the Lisbon Treaty, means that we now have a minority in terms of anything to do with the financial sector, so we can be outvoted. Some people fear there might be a structural bias among </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">eurozone</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> members, so that future voting structure is a key issue.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The second very quick point in terms of the survey is that macroeconomic environment is very </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">key</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in terms of how people often judge things. It is not just regulation. For instance, in the global competitiveness index we </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">fell</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> a couple of points. The issue I would stress is it is not just about the competition of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> versus Frankfurt and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Paris</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. The key issue in the future debate is the point that Sir Nigel made about the City helping </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. It is about how we position ourselves given what is happening in the rest of the world. The City could easily do relatively well in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> but stagnate as people move business, or grow business more likely, in other markets overseas.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I have seven more colleagues who want to come in so I am going to have to ask for quicker questions and quick replies if at all possible, with the replies supplemented if necessary with written evidence if you feel we are not giving you the chance to say what you want to say.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q10 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">John Mann:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I only have one question.

In the rationale for why the EU exists in the first place, it is to create greater economies of scale. By and large, most policies that get debated resist cross-border services integration. It is a major shortfall, in my judgment, of the EU’s success to date and is something that is vital for this country, which has even more of its GDP in services than the average of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Nigel Wicks</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: If I had a list of six points, Mr O’Neill’s point would have been one of the six, but I will give another one. For every piece of legislation, for every action that is taken by the Commission, the Parliament or by the Council of Ministers, they should ask themselves—and I am talking about the financial area—how does this impact in Korea, China, Brazil and the rest of the world? Does it help our financial industries compete there and does it help their financial industries, in a sense, come into our markets?

When the crisis hit, it highlighted the scale of the shadow banking industry. It highlighted the high scale of intra-financial activity, but it also highlighted the need for our banks to be well capitalised and liquid. What I think we have in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is a pretty good post-crisis macroeconomic </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">framework.

Let me very briefly elaborate. First of all, I think the Government did a good job some several months back when they agreed a new voting mechanism for the EBA, the European Banking Authority. That was a good day’s work and helpful.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">If you do not mind me quoting something very short from a speech that Andrea </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Enria</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, who is the chairperson of the European Banking Authority, made last week in Brussels, it goes directly to your question. He said, “We are still facing a risk that the repair of the single market will proceed with different speed and will be driven by different priorities within and outside the SSM jurisdiction. We cannot rule out the possibility that a rift opens up in the single market between member states adhering to the SSM and SRM, and those that continue to rely on national tools for supervision and resolution. Only by maintaining an attentive focus on common rules—the single rulebook—common supervisory practices, strong mechanisms for supervisory co-operation and joint decisions, and especially joined-up approaches to resolution, will we be able to contain the risk of a split two-tier system and restore the functioning of the single market as a whole.” Now, I think that they are very wise words. I agree with them and that is, I </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">hope,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> an answer to your question.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q17 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrea </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Leadsom</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What should Mark Carney and/or George Osborne be doing to address that concern?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Nigel Wicks</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: For one thing, I would hope that the authorities in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> are worried about that concern. There are certain people in the Commission who are worried and, judging by what I have just read out, the chairperson of the EBA is concerned. What should we be doing? All the relevant public authorities from the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Governor of the Bank of England, PRA, FCA, and so on should fall over backwards within a strict definition of our national interest to co-operate, to have the right tone and to give the impression that we are here to make it all work rather than to throw spanners in the works.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q18 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrea </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Leadsom</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Okay.

The SSM, the supervisory mechanism, is effectively under the ultimate control of the governing council of the ECB. For good reason we are not members of the governing council of the ECB and since that is the case, since we are not part of the overall control, it would be wrong for us to be a member of the SSM.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Secondly, the supervisory decisions can in certain circumstances have fiscal consequences. We all want to avoid banks having to rely on the taxpayer, but you cannot get rid of the possibility in extremity. Under existing arrangements, if we were part of the SSM, and technically we could, it is not at all clear who would be responsible for the fiscal consequences arising from not only problems in this country but problems in other countries. Until that was sorted out, I do not think we should go near it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q20 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrea </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Leadsom</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you agree that there is, however, a residual risk, quite apart from the existence of the SSM there and not here, from the fact that European banking union is far from completed? For example, we had the situation with the Cyprus banks only recently where, in effect, the British taxpayer had to bail out the customer depositors in Cyprus bank branches in London while the ECB decided to haircut all customer deposits in Cyprus. Specifically, is it essential that European banking union is completed and what steps do you believe need to be taken in order for that to be finalised?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Nigel Wicks</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Well, I am not an absolute expert on what happened with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Cyprus</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and whether it was branches that were bailed out or subsidiaries.

You have to be absolutely clear if a bank gets into resolution who it is bears the costs. To put it rather simply, it is the shareholders; it is junior debt holders; it is senior debt holders.

The resolution scheme and the relationship we have with the EZ becomes the issue for us. At the end of the day, you can construct a plausible downside scenario, more macroeconomic rather than linked to the supervisory resolution scheme that causes the problem, but whatever happens on the continent we need to make sure we are resilient in the face of shocks. That comes back to the whole macroeconomic framework. The questioning that you were following, yes, if there was a risk, yes, there is contagion to the UK, but I could easily give you a plausible, very positive upside scenario based on macroeconomic criteria from the rest of the world, so we need to keep this in context.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q28 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrea </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Leadsom</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes, but what I am trying to get at is, worst case scenario, there is a European banking union where there is a supervisor but no means of resolution.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Lyons</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes, they need to sort that out.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q29 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Andrea </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Leadsom</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I am asking you: is it in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Britain</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’s essential national interest that they complete banking union?

My answer to your question would be almost like a four-sector diagram. Hopefully I can picture it. People always talk about “in versus out”. If you put that on one side, but if you put at the top “reform” and “not reform”, the top “reform” versus “not reform” is often overlooked in this debate and is </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">key</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. People focus almost too much, or exclusively rather, on the in versus out. The ideal would be in and reformed, but in and not reformed might well be where we turn up to be: the status quo. If we leave and we are in the out and we do not reform, that is not good. If we are out and we continue to reform—reform our economy, our financial sector—then it is possible to see the City of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> still being successful. It will probably not be the optimal situation. I would argue it would be more successful within a reformed EU.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Coming back to your specific question, Mr Love, if we were outside and if we were continuing to reform, i.e. move with the times, having a good relationship with the EU from an outside perspective and also positioning ourselves in the changing global economy, then it is possible to see the City of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> still being successful. It is not only dependent on being in the EU, but I would argue the most important thing that we should press for—and because this would be in our best interests—would be to remain in the EU and to see the financial sector remain Europe’s financial sector and to reform. Even if we are in the EU and reforming, we still have to make sure our relationship with the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">eurozone</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> members, not being a member of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">eurozone</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is clear and works in our best interests.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q32 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Love:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Sir Nigel, if we take that answer just given, following either the Norwegian or the Swiss model and being outside, would we have any influence over that reform agenda?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Nigel Wicks</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I have to say I entirely agree with you. It is difficult, Mr Love, to gauge exactly the opinion of the international banks in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. My fairly well-informed view is that they want to remain a part of the single financial market and they want to remain in a position where they can influence the development of the single financial market, the regulations or directives as they come through. Because many of the banks and senior people are from other countries, they will not get involved in the argument about whether we should stay in or stay out. When constitutional issues are being discussed in countries, often the people in neighbouring countries are reluctant to say what should happen. They say it is a matter for the people of that country. That is the view that many of the banks take about the general question of in and out, but they are clear on the point about the single market.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">To answer your question about the Norwegian and the Swiss models, for various reasons I think neither model would be a very good idea. Indeed, I think both would have very significant disadvantages. They would still make us subject to certain aspects of EU law but give us no influence about the development of that EU law. When it comes down to it, you are either in or you are out.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q33 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Love:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You have all gone on quite a lot about the single market and financial services being very important. You mentioned it in relation to international banks. Membership of EFTA gives us access to the single market. It does not give us any power to influence the reform agenda, but it gives us access. In certain circumstances where the reform agenda has stalled, we keep hearing about the problems that are going to arise over banking union. Would there be an occasion in the future where we might say the reform agenda has stalled; we are better on the outside rather than the inside?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jim O'Neill</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I guess my views have moved through time, and this is partly why I reminded you at the start I was no longer at Goldman Sachs. Most human beings have a very static view of life, but the world is evolving dramatically, including trade and financial relationships. While even in manufacturing and everything else the EU is our biggest percentage partner, in terms of the rate of change it is increasingly less important. Going back to what I said about the advantages we have, the City of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is beautifully placed to be the major financial services centre for the world. In the interests of that and what it contributes to the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, which is substantial, we should not be constrained by dumb reform or the absence of it in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Brussels</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> or elsewhere. I believe that if it is increasingly the case that we should, we should not be so scared of exploring a world without it because the opportunities that are arising from the dramatically changing world are huge. I do not think quite a lot of people in our area, never mind just people in Brussels, either are that interested or understand it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Lyons</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes, I would just like to reinforce that. I was involved in the No Campaign. We were told if we did not join the euro it would be disastrous for the City of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. We did not join the euro and the City of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> did do well. Now, admittedly, the EU debate is very different to the euro debate itself, hence the point I made: ideally we should stay in. I agree with Jim and it is a point I made earlier. This should be about repositioning Europe, including the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, in the changing global economy. The rest of the world is really moving on. The pace and scale of change, the catch-up potential around the world, is key. We need to be thinking about not only a strong position of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> within Europe but a strong position of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in the global picture. Ideally, we do that as part of the EU, but if the British people voted to leave, then I still think we can make a success of it whatever happens.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q34 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Love:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Perhaps I can ask Sir Nigel whether he agrees with that: in essence, the City is strong enough to survive whether we are in or out and, whether there might be some modest advantages of being in, we could easily survive with the changing world economy that we are seeing at the present time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir Nigel Wicks</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: First of all, let me say where I agree with my colleagues, and that is the world outside </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is changing at a rapid rate. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The world that we see now and the world as it is likely to be in 20 or 30 years in terms of economic influence and power balance will be very different.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The key for us in this country is to position ourselves where we still have influence there—that is a bit Foreign Office speak but I still think it is important—but also where we are able to put the country in a position where the people of this country can have a good living out of that. That is what we need to do.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I am of the view that we are more likely to be able to do that as continuing members of the European Union. I believe that if we are continuing members of the European Union it is more likely that the European Union will reform itself. As came out of discussion earlier, we do have many friends, many colleague member states, who would like reform. We are a big member state. We are a member state with a lot of influence, and as wholehearted members of the European Union I think we will stand a better chance of reforming the European </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Union, which is not only in the interests of the rest of the European Union, it is in the interests of us.

Just so that everything is covered, if we were to go down the other path of leaving, the transaction costs would be significant. The uncertainty would be significant and also the importance of Article 50 under the Lisbon Treaty is the key thing as well. The future relationship between the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and the euro area would then have to be determined.

We have talked in some detail about the difficulties of achieving a banking union. There is a lot of talk about the Anglo-Saxon model not having worked and quite a lot of antagonism at a European level. Will we reach a point where it does become a choice of leaving because we are not influencing the reform agenda and, therefore, it would be better in the future circumstances with the world economy for us to be on the outside?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Lyons</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I could construct for you lots of plausible scenarios. The issue at the moment is that we are still in a post-crisis situation in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. The rest of the world is starting to grow strongly. The IMF talked about a three-speed world. In reality, we will probably have a multi-speed world, but the fast lane is the emerging economies, albeit slow but still fast lane. The middle lane is now the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">US</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. The slow lane is still Europe and the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, but we are likely to gather speed. A lot of the tensions, shall we say, are heavily influenced by the macroeconomic environment. As the macroeconomic environment improves in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, as I think it will, then that should ease some of these tensions.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Look, in a nutshell, I think it is about repositioning ourselves. As Sir Nigel touched on, if we can make the EU reform that is the ideal scenario. I could construct a scenario where we leave because the British people vote to leave. If that happens, then we need to very much think hard and fast about what we need to do and reform.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">To conclude, if we had a referendum, a “yes” vote is as important as a “no” vote because what I hear in the City is that people do not think that we engage as well as we should do strategically in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. We need to be doing that more.

PwC have talked of 29 legal texts currently being negotiated or expected to be tabled by the Commission in the near future. You, Mr O’Neill, have spoken in very diplomatic terms of an onslaught of regulatory nonsense, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">and there are 29. I would like to get a simple audit for us before we go of what we should be looking out for. I will start with you, Mr O’Neill, given that is your phrase. Of this whole terrain, can you tell us if you think there is anything good and in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’s interests in it? On the flipside, a bit like what John Mann asked you about, I am asking you to range a little bit wider than just one. What are the things we should be looking out for that you think are harmful to the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’s interests?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jim O'Neill</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Just on Mr Love’s question, my view is it could. I can certainly see a situation where we might want to just go alone, and we should not be so scared about it, in my view. I would not have said </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">that</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> five years ago.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">On this, good luck. I sit on the board of a European think tank, BRUEGEL, and have done since it was started. There are some times when I am at a board meeting where these issues come up and it is like Swahili, so good luck to you. You need PwC and others ahead of it to simplify it for you. There are clearly things that are being pursued that are not in the interests of the City of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’s role in the world and, therefore, its role for the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">; in particular, the financial transactions tax. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The damage that would do to GDP in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, never mind elsewhere, is articulated by a host of independent entities.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It could, in some ways that they are trying to execute it, cause the whole EMU crisis to flare up again, never mind anything else.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q37 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr McFadden:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you think the damage to the UK that could be caused by some of these things is accidental collateral damage because people are just not taking into account UK interests, or do you think it is a targeting?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jim O'Neill</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think there are two parts. Going back to what I tried to emphasise carefully at the start, quite a few of the member countries think about what role the banking sector plays for their own domestic economies. There might be things that we could learn as a nation about that, but that is distinct from the role the City is playing for the world and the service royalties. They do not think about that. They think much more about the first thing. They do not appreciate or even know or want to consider this huge role that the City plays for the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and the world. In some countries’ cases, I do not think it is conscious. It is certainly not a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Brussels</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> view but, of course, one of their own dilemmas is they are frequently influenced not by what they think but by what noisy voices inside the Council of Europe think. There may well be some of those that see it as quite a good thing to knock us down to size, so through that the EU is influenced, but not consciously.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q38 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr McFadden:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It is not all bad, is it? For example, the Government has chosen to pursue the bail-in resolution thing through an EU directive, to my surprise. I am a bit surprised that this Government in particular is choosing to pursue that at an EU level, but they are. The argument for doing so is that some of these things require international rules and it makes sense to do it that way. Not all of these 29 pieces of legislation or proposals are against the interests of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jim O'Neill</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: No, of course not. I do not know them all because, as I say, it is like Swahili, a lot of it. There is one that is probably very helpful, but I wanted to highlight the scale of the potential damage that the financial transactions tax could do.

I do not think it is either/or. I think it is </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> should help us be global.

Undoubtedly, things have gone wrong in the Anglo-Saxon capital markets, but the Spanish </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">caixa</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> banks did not get into problems because of Anglo-Saxon capitalism. The Greek banks and the Cypriot banks did not get into problems because of Anglo-Saxon capitalism. You look at many of the banks in this country, including the nationalised ones. Why did they get into trouble? It was not Anglo-Saxon capitalism, it was bad lending. While I am not necessarily a defender of everything that goes on under the heading of Anglo-Saxon capitalism—and, by the way, I make a very great distinction between Anglo-Saxon capitalism this side of the Atlantic and the other side of the Atlantic—I am not one of the people who accept for one moment that Anglo-Saxon capitalism is causing all the financial and economic ills we have.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">To go on to your point asking the question which one we should support, I think the bank resolution and recovery directive is absolutely a key one. This is different from the resolution mechanism that I was discussing with Ms </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Leadsom</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> because that applies just to the euro area. This one applies to the lot. Logically, we should have started off with the bank resolution and recovery measure. That is the key one. What happens if banks get into a muddle and something has to happen? How can we put ourselves in a position such that the taxpayer is not called in to bail them out and the essential services offered by those banks continue? Discussions are going on virtually as we speak in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Brussels</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> about this directive. It is dragging on but it is important that it is finalised before the end of this Parliament and the end of this Commission because if it spills over I do not think they have the mechanism—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q40 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr McFadden:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What is your betting?

We have a special banking resolution mechanism that was introduced some time ago and that seems to have worked. But these banks, as the point came out earlier on, are all subject to contagion and they all operate cross-border. In our region of the world, which is </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, we really do need some common rules, common understandings, about how it should be done.

It is not only determined, but it is implemented at European Union level. Competition policy is something that impinges very much on national sovereignty. We have seen that as a result of some bank rescues, the Brussels Commissioner </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Almunia</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has said, “Go ahead, but you have to divest them service by service.” It works. It basically works and is quite reasonable. There is not much challenge.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We have to get ourselves in the same position where we have a mechanism that works efficiently and fairly when it comes to bank resolution and recovery, and that should be at the top of the agenda.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr Lyons</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: A lot of the points have been made. I think we basically need to do what is right for the economy and protect the taxpayer. Competition I think is a key part. My concern about the regulatory pendulum as such is that if it swings too far it impinges on competition because the regulatory burden stops new entrants.

One is the statement of intent and one is the actual level it is imposed at. A statement of intent, if it was seen that we are now going to go down a further path of taxation, albeit in this area, might have a direct and indirect impact in terms of competitiveness or people’s thinking. I think the second point is also important, which is the level. The financial transactions tax, as I understand it, would be imposed at a pretty minimal rate.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It comes back to something Sir Nigel was talking about earlier about balkanisation, and it is the need to look at all this in the global picture. Certainly the global picture Jim and I were talking about earlier in macroeconomic terms is a real positive in terms of the size of the global economic cake. In terms of the financial sector, it is to avoid the unintended consequences, or the balkanisation.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">If you had a statement of intent and people thought </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> might eventually be impacted, then that could favour other financial centres.

If applied as generally proposed, without getting too technical about it, the marginal influence of things like repaying of bonds, it could be a nightmare for some of the peripheral European bond markets that have recovered in the past 12 months and push them even more into an deflationary situation than they currently are.

I think it is, from my experience, a bit dangerous to try to distinguish between high frequency trading for the sake of high frequency trading and what that does for the ease of other substantive and necessary things, such as financing Government bonds.

While I do not personally believe there are continental European centres that could provide some of these services, some highly mobile global firms could consider doing some of these things more from New York than they do from London, or they would explore other jurisdictions around the world that, as I am sure you are very aware, in the past three years are offering tax incentives to do so anyhow.

The change in world trade that is taking place is unheard of for multiple generations, so any organisational structure that assumes status quo is in trouble. One of the problems about the EU and many of its members is they seem to live in a very status quo environment.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The very latest evidence shows that German export growth to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">China</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has slowed considerably, so if we were to focus more on the very latest trend as opposed to the past decade, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">China</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> won’t be double to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">France</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, but it will definitely be bigger.

They play more to the advantages, which is why this issue is so important for us. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Ruffley</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Financial services? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jim O</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">’</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Neill</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Including financial services.

I think the global economy is going to really do fantastically well over the next almost 25 years. That is despite incredible near-term challenges and uncertainty. If you sit looking at things from a European perspective, you can think we are in a very difficult situation because demand is weak, lending is weak and confidence is weak. If you jump on a plane to the other side of the world, things look very different. I was out in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">China</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> a few weeks ago with the mayor and I am going out next week when the Prime Minister is out there.

That is important. If </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> becomes an offshore centre for the R&amp;B, that is important.

If you look at the latest state of financial and insurance services, they are almost 21% of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> economy. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is about a quarter of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> economy. The European Commission earlier this year came out with their most competitive regions in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Europe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. What was interesting is that three of those are in the south of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. Bedfordshire, Berkshire and Oxfordshire were fifth place; Surrey and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Sussex</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> were in third place. I would argue that is because </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> was in second place. So the competitiveness angle is </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">key</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> but of course we need other parts of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> economy to be doing well, hence your City issue. The gist of it is that we are all in it together.
