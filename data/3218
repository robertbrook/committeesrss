They have now peaked and are starting to come down. That really reflects experience in the United States, where, as you get a good understanding of the scale of the challenge and of some of the older facilities that are being dealt with, you get a good grip on both the schedule and the cost going forward, and then you are able to innovate and bring costs down. What we are seeing at </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Sellafield</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, which is the driver that is taking the cost up, is that we are still uncovering some of the issues at </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Sellafield</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and still understanding the complexities, the timescale and the cost that will be required to retrieve waste from some of these very old facilities with very high inventories of radioactive material </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">in them.

There is ourselves as the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, the owner of the sites, and we decide on a strategic basis what activities we wish to be conducted. We do that in conjunction with the site licence companies—the companies that are the legal operators of the sites. They hold the nuclear site licence and the environmental permits for operating the site, and they are obliged to act in the best interests of safety, security and environmental protection. It is a combination of discussion between ourselves as the owner and the licence companies as the legal duty holder for operating the site to decide what work is necessary. The licence companies then put together plans for how they will tackle the work that needs to be done, how long they believe that will take and how much they think it will cost. We review those plans on an audit basis: we carry out benchmarking where we can, we bring in independent expertise to look where appropriate, and we take a judgment as to whether we think the estimates are appropriate or not. Ultimately, when we are satisfied, we approve the plan and then we measure performance against that plan going forward.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q3 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> How do you incentivise the site companies to come up with accurate figures?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">John Clarke</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Incentivisation</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is complex and different depending on the nature of the contracts that we have. If I take </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Dounreay</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, for example, in the far north of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, we have a target cost contract there, where the operators of the site have bid a schedule and a cost to complete a defined scope of work. It is clearly in their interests to make sure that that cost and schedule are as tight as possible because we go through a competitive process and essentially the lowest bid wins. They are then incentivised to beat that where possible. Where we have a target cost, there is a competitive tension to bring estimates down and then to beat them.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Elsewhere in the estate where we have cost reimbursable contracts, we rely on the fact that we carry out benchmarking and we carry out audits to ensure that the plans are appropriate and are not unnecessarily fat. We then incentivise the licence companies to achieve targets against those plans.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q4 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> How easy is it to do benchmarking?

There are no real comparators for some of the old facilities at </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Sellafield</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. The closest you can get are one or two of the facilities in the United States Department of Energy clean-up programme, but even there you are not really looking at the same levels of radioactivity, the same inventories or, indeed, the same congestion on the site. We are able to benchmark against certain activities, particularly new build construction—we can do certain benchmarks there—but it is quite difficult against some of the older facilities. We have been looking progressively </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">to find better benchmarks; indeed, there are actions that have arisen from other investigations, National Audit Office recommendations and so on, which we are pursuing.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q5 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> In your annual report you mention how sensitive future costs are to unknowns such as the disposal site and the geology of it.

We try to make sure that we have a good estimate of the range of possible costs and durations and then we use management judgment for a best estimate. On things like disposal, until there a site is identified, there will be unknowns. We will be looking on a generic design that is suitable for a range of geologies. In terms of storage, we are assuming that we need to store for a fixed period of time, but we are also looking to make sure that stores are extendable both in their lives and in terms of size. We are constantly looking to make sure we have built in as much contingency as we can, but always trying to make sure that we have the best estimate that we can going forward.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q6 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Obviously, here we are dealing with the legacy of past generations’ nuclear programme and investment and decision making.

Yes, there is uncertainty relating to the costs of waste disposal, but in many ways it is like a pension fund where you have assets that are building up, future assets uncertain and a certain degree of uncertainty about the liabilities. Part of the requirement for new build is that there is a process for repeatedly assessing the assets and liabilities and making sure that the costs are prudently covered</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">at all times.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q7 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You alluded to it, but do you foresee more certainty than the previous generation left us with?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mark </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Higson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Certainly, as experience builds on decommissioning nuclear power stations. Many of the issues about the costs of clearing up at </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Sellafield</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> relate to the uncertainty of how the material should be disposed of and treated and, earlier on, uncertainty about what exactly the material was. What we are proposing for new build going forward is that the waste in terms of spent fuel should be stored onsite in facilities capable of lasting at least 100 years and then transferred into canisters and placed in a geological disposal facility when it is ready.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q8 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Thanks very much. One of the ways you reduce your cost to the taxpayer is by recovering costs from third parties—I think it was £2 billion of the £59 billion total. Is there more you could do to earn money to defray the tax bill?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">John Clarke</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The £2 billion is the contribution of the nuclear provision that is liable to third party owners of material. That really arises from contracts that have existed for many years </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">which were inherited by the NDA from primarily British Nuclear Fuels Limited, where services were provided to overseas customers particularly for spent fuel management. As a result of those services, there are waste management contracts going forward that have third party funding obligations associated with them. What more we can do is limited in that really those costs are associated with foreign-owned material. The vast majority of the material we are dealing with is </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> owned and there is only one funder for UK-owned material. What we are of course doing, though, is looking at where we can liberate funds from the sale of surplus assets, land or sites that we no longer require, or indeed on occasions small businesses that we have held that we could possibly sell off as well, but they will not make an enormous contribution to the substantial </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> provision.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q9 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Some of my colleagues have nuclear plants in their own constituencies so they physically see what is going on. I have absolutely no concept of what decommissioning a plant physically means and why it costs such eye-wateringly large sums. You could build HS2 for the sum we are talking about.

In the next two years, we will have finished all of the work associated with it to put it into what we call care and maintenance, where it will sit for many decades until there is a waste depository available to take it down and put it away.

There are armies of people working on fastening new structural steelwork to the outside of the building, cladding it—there is an enormous amount of work going on. There are 900 people working on the site at the moment; there were only 300 people working on the site when it was operational. You need an enormous number of people to make sure that you can take out material that is there, put material on, put cladding on the building, et cetera, to look after it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That is quite a small proportion of the spend, though.

We are building very significant facilities to enable that waste to be removed.

There are two reasons for that. One is it allows some of the radioactivity there to naturally decay, which means that it is simpler to dismantle when the time comes.

The waste then has to be conditioned, usually involving solidifying it with concrete in stainless steel or ductile cast iron containers, and then placed into storage.

We have found that has worked well across the estate generally and we find it works particularly well where we are able to have very clearly defined scope and we can ask the private sector to bid, schedule and cost against that scope. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Dounreay</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> would be a good example of that and we are currently running through a competition for the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Magnox</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> research reactor sites—12 sites spread across the UK—where we expect the same sort of issue to arise.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We have a slightly different dynamic where you have less clarity on scope and, therefore, it is not possible for a parent body organisation to bid, schedule and cost. In that case, we use the parent body organisation primarily as a resource enhancer. It brings in a high quality executive team to run the site and provides reach back into its parent body companies to provide specific expertise to aid the process going forward. We have found that model works pretty well to date and that is the model we are continuing with.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q27 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Are there any lessons to be learnt from the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Dounreay</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> contract on letting contracts for other sites?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">John Clarke</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Certainly.

We have enhanced them in some areas. We have put some additional resource of our own in place and we have also brought in some additional external resource where appropriate. I think the issue is less about oversight itself and more about the inherent uncertainties that there are in some of the projects. This is going to sound slightly glib but paying more attention to it from an NDA perspective is not going to fundamentally reduce the level of uncertainty and risk in some of these projects. That is not to say that we should not make sure that we are carrying out good oversight; we are absolutely committed to that, but it is not just the level of oversight from ourselves.

I think if you look at the projects that the PAC looked at in November last year, there is a combination of some poor performance against some of those plants where we hold the contractor to account and their fee is significantly reduced as a result of that, but there are some projects where it is not about performance; it is about understanding and the discovery of unknowns.

There will continue to be unforeseen difficulties and obstacles due to the inherent uncertainties particularly at </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Sellafield</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, but I think the evidence of the way the competitions have been run and the way that projected lifetime costs are coming down everywhere in the NDA’s portfolio except at </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Sellafield</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> does provide grounds for solid confidence that this ambition is heading in the right direction.

Repeating what I said before, I think our experience has shown that that works best where we can clearly define scope and then we can allow the private sector to bid, schedule and cost against that.

They see these reports. They see the headlines in newspapers. Do you think the NDA and site owners are doing enough to allay people’s fears and perhaps some myths that may exist? What I am saying is, okay, you have only been going for eight years and you have a difficult job; you say it is complex, but a lot of people think, “Are they hiding something by saying this?” Is there anything that you think you can do as an organisation, or maybe the Shareholder Executive and others can do, to be more transparent and open and provide more information?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">John Clarke</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We try very hard to be transparent and open.

We have looked at other public bodies in terms of what they report to see what we can learn from them. The experience that we have seen so far, and we have taken guidance from the Major Projects Authority on this, is that the level of transparency we give on project performance is greater than that given in many areas, including the Olympics during its construction phase. That said, we are always looking to find ways of providing information that is meaningful and helpful to people. I accept we can always do more, but I think it is really quite difficult to counter people who have quite strong views about what goes on there.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q44 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Albert Owen:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Sure, but is there a public information centre there, for instance, where people can go out of interest and find out exactly what is going on in the nuclear industry, including decommissioning?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">John Clarke</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There are visitor centres at various places that people can access.

We have just committed to another nuclear reactor, which is going to produce waste. There is an argument—I think a compelling argument—that we should not be building reactors that produce waste, but we have. In view of that, is that going to be cheaper to clear up because we are going to know—because, I presume, we are going to keep an audit of what is there—unlike previously when we did not because it was secret, because it was about weapons materiel manufacture?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">John Clarke</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes. Certainly based on our experience within the NDA, where the material that you have is well quantified, well characterised, we have seen costs increase to some extent but then come down, and we are now pretty confident that we have a very good grip on those. If you look at the more modern reactors, they are designed with decommissioning in mind. The original reactors were not designed with decommissioning in mind, so that presents an extra degree of challenge. I think the real area where the comparison with new nuclear power stations and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Sellafield</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is false is the facilities that you referred to based back in the original weapons and early research programmes where waste was not characterised. There was no thought given for how it would be retrieved. That sort of regime will not exist at all as we go forward. I could not put a number on it, but we spend about £700 million per year on four of the major high-hazard facilities at </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Sellafield</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, so it is a not insignificant part of our budget.

I am absolutely amazed, I have to say, Mr Clarke, that it was you who said that it was the right decision to extend this contract, bearing in mind—if I can just mention two or three things or possibly more than that—that the National Audit Office said there was huge concerns over value for money; there have been cost increases; there have been delays of between two to 19 months in 2011 to 2012; they failed to achieve 10 out of 32 of their targets; they have been fined </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">for sending waste to landfill; and there have been claims of incorrect expenses.

We have reached the first of those five-year review points, which comes to fruition at 31 March next year. We looked at performance in the round at </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Sellafield</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. There has been some very good performance and there has been some very disappointing performance. Some of the disappointing performance was highlighted by the National Audit Office review and the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Public Accounts Committee</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> hearing. I think it is important to note that the scope of the National Audit Office review and, therefore, the PAC hearing itself represented less than 25% of the total amount of work done at the site. It is an important 25% but it does not represent all of the work done there. We did look at the overall performance of Nuclear Management Partners and we looked at alternatives to extending the contract. Our conclusion at this point is that the way forward that represents the best likelihood of achieving the outcome that we wish at </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Sellafield</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and represents the best likelihood of delivery and value for money as we go forward at this stage was to extend the contract.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q48 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Ian </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lavery</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> How are we going to ensure that the targets that have been set will be achieved?

We have made it very clear that some of the things that have gone on have not been satisfactory and we expect to see improvement, but equally, going back to one of my earlier comments, I think we have to expect that there will continue to be disappointments, setbacks, cost increases, schedule delays in a number of these projects as we move forward as we uncover things that we do not currently understand and we get a better understanding of those. That is not to excuse poor performance in any way, shape or form and we absolutely take punitive action when performance is poor.

It is an issue I have raised quite a few times and I have not had a significant answer. Perhaps I have not asked the question directly, but I am asking it now. What percentage of waste comes from historical civil nuclear, from the defence industry and from medical practice? It is not all produced by civil nuclear as it is often portrayed, although I know it is all historical and has to be dealt with. Are there any figures that if you do not have them at hand could be given to the Committee? For instance, X-rays in medical facilities, research in medical facilities into radiation and things, that all has to be dealt with separately and properly. Is there any way we could get those figures or do you know them off the top of your head?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">John Clarke</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I do not know those figures off the top of my head. Certainly, the proportion of waste that we deal with that comes from medical and research sources is really quite modest. There is a significant proportion of the waste that came from the original defence programme; many of the facilities at </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Sellafield</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and elsewhere were built specifically for the weapons programme. There is a period of time when the weapons programme merges into </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">early commercialisation of nuclear power and there was dual usage of some of the facilities and then finally into purely power generating. I do not have those figures but I could look to see what information we have and provide a note.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q69 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Albert Owen:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It would be useful to have a breakdown of what is high radioactive, what is medium in potential terms and what is low as radiation.

They are generally short-lived radioactive. That is their nature. Something that gives off most radiation is shorter lived and something that gives off lower levels of radiation is longer lived generally. That is a bit of a simplification.

Clearly, over the course of a working month there will be lots of day-to-day contact between my team and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority on delivery, monitoring, tracking spend, tracking delivery of milestones. There will be formal meetings. Once a month we chair a monthly governance meeting, once a quarter a higher level version of that same meeting involving not just my team but stakeholders from the Scottish Executive, from the Treasury and elsewhere, to make sure that progress is being tracked, milestones if they are being missed are being flagged and there is proper follow-up. There is also a great deal of involvement from the Department of Energy and Climate Change, where Baroness </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Verma</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> sees the NDA chair and Mr Clarke once a quarter, the Secretary of State on a six-monthly basis, and a range of reporting that flows formally from the NDA through the Shareholder Executive and upwards within the Department of Energy and Climate Change once a month. There is absolutely a balance to be struck, which is precisely the function that the Shareholder Executive exists to perform, as I say, on behalf of Government as a whole, particularly where there is a requirement for governance, finance and commercial expertise.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q74 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dan </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Byles</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What about this triangular relationship between the NDA, the Scottish Executive and the Secretary of State?

I think there was a broad consensus that bringing to bear private sector skills, private sector innovation and competitive pressure has to be the right way to go about tackling this very challenging set of circumstances. Accordingly, it is necessary to pay market rates to bring in individuals with suitable qualifications and expertise from a range of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">industries—the nuclear industry, the oil and gas industry, big infrastructure; you understand the rest of the list—and therefore by design creating an executive, non-departmental public body with sufficient distance from Central Government to be able to operate in a competitive commercial marketplace, did feel and continues to feel like the right answer. The Secretary of State does have effectively the right of veto over the chief executive appointment, including the remuneration package, and directly sets the remuneration, in consultation with the Cabinet Office and elsewhere in Government, of the non-executive members of the NDA board. Ultimately, of course, if the NDA board, including its remuneration committee, is taking decisions that Central Government profoundly disagrees with in terms of executive pay, Government obviously has the levers to change the NDA board if radical action of that sort is required.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q84 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dan </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Byles</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Would you see an advisory role from your organisation if the Government were going down that line?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Ken McCallum</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Absolutely.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q85 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I have two factual questions.
