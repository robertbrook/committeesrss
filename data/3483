We will make a prompt start because I know you have an appointment elsewhere later in the afternoon. We will try to ensure that we draw our proceedings to a close in a way that fits in with that. Sir David, you are very welcome and are a repeat visitor to this Committee. Mr Baumann, I think it is the first time you have been here; you are very welcome.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Having dealt with the pleasantries, I will go straight into the questions. We would like to start by looking at the performance of the NHS against what we term the Nicholson challenge—the need to deliver a 4% efficiency gain or £15 billion to £20 billion in the period to 2015—in the year to March 2013 and in the current year. Last year, you provided an analysis for us that showed how you achieved the savings targets for the year ended 2012, partly through pay restraint, partly through service reconfiguration and partly through a number of other, shorter-term effects. I would like to begin by asking you how you would report on the achievement of efficiency targets during the year ended 2013, and how those were achieved.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir David Nicholson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is worth pointing out that this is the fourth year of little or no growth for the NHS, which is unprecedented in its history. In the first year, we delivered £4.3 billion-worth of savings. That was </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">audited</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> by the Audit Commission, as it was then; the National Audit Office has done the work since then. We have done just over £5 billion for the next two years. For this year, I think we are on target to deliver £4.2 billion—or £4.4 billion—which is what we expected to do. It is true to say that the way in which we are delivering it is broadly similar to what we have described in the past. I think we are doing </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">more than we expected through basic efficiency and less through transformational change. We have had that conversation before, but that is still the case this year.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Baumann</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Could I clarify the number? I think you misheard my mumble. We will deliver £4 billion this year, against a target of £4.2 billion. As David has just said, the bit of it that we are struggling to deliver in full is the transformational part of the commissioner savings. We are about 20% off the target of those, which reflects the difficulty of making the transformational change happen at the pace at which we need it.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q2 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> One of the concerns the Committee has expressed in the past is that, when these efficiency gains are analysed, a significant portion of them either rely on wage restraint, which cannot be sustained indefinitely, or rely on property disposals or other short-term issues that release cash in-year but do not deliver sustainable efficiency gain. How much, last year of the £5 billion, and this year of the £4 billion, is sustainable in the long run?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Baumann</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: For this year, which I think I am better placed to comment on than last year, there is very little that is not sustainable. The issue is how we can increase the proportion of transformational savings for the future and reduce the amount of transactional ones, because clearly those will run out. However, as I look at it, I do not think there is anything this year that I would say is temporary in nature, non-recurrent or whatever. As you have seen in the past, the NAO has confirmed that 90% of the savings have been recurrent. I see this year as being a continuation of that pattern.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q3 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Could you send the Committee an analysis for the whole of this four-year period to which Sir David referred, from the beginning of the period, showing how these numbers are arrived at and what they represent, in terms of the different headings?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Baumann</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q4 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Valerie Vaz:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> By transformational change, do you mean the reorganisation under the Health and Social Care Act or are you talking about something different? Could you define what you mean?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir David Nicholson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I am very happy to do that. In terms of the management cost savings that were required as part of the approach to the overall efficiency gain, we are well on target to deliver £1.5 billion of recurring savings from that activity. That comes out of all of the changes that you have described as the reforms and such matters. There are two aspects of transformational change that have been less successful. One of them is stemming the flow, if you like, or reorganising the services to ensure that we have better control and a better handle over emergency care; the Committee has been through all of that before. Secondly, there was an implication behind the changes that we would do more centralisation and concentration of services in a smaller number of organisations. We have made progress in both of those areas, but we have not made it fast enough or significantly enough across the whole country.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I turn to Barbara.

Could we start with that? What are your views on continued pay restraint, in the light of what the Government are trying to achieve with pay?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir David Nicholson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The issue for us is that if you look at the NHS going forward—over the next year and, indeed, the next two or three years—there is little indication in all of that that we are going to get any extra real-terms growth; we may get a little bit, but there is relatively little. In those circumstances, one of the key things that we need to do—because of the scale of it—is to control the total pay bill. There are a whole lot of different ways of doing that. The one that we have used so far is to control the headline increase in pay, which we have done by either a pay freeze or the 1%. Of course, as you know, in the NHS there are all sorts of incremental schemes that go on simultaneously. Although, for example, we had a pay freeze, the actual increase in pay across the NHS was 0.7%, because of the incremental changes. The issue for us is what we do with the headline pay and what we do about increments. That is the conversation that is going on with the pay review body at the moment.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Baumann</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is perhaps worth saying that the pay drift that you have just described—in terms of increments—is gradually coming down in the service as we go through it. As you quite rightly said, in 2011-12 it was 0.7%; in 2012-13 it was 0.5%. I cannot guarantee that it will continue to come down in quite that linear fashion, but it is naturally and necessarily a reducing part of the problem.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q6 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara Keeley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Clearly 1% of a not very high amount is not very much. Nurse salaries now start at £21,388. Perhaps you could comment on the view expressed by Professor Keogh this morning, who said that NHS senior managers “deserve” their “very significant salaries”, bearing in mind the context that the top 10 salaries paid to senior managers in the NHS amount to £1.7 million, ranging from £155,000 to £210,000. Here we have someone very senior in the team who, when asked about it, says that senior managers “deserve very significant salaries”. What does that say to the rest of the NHS about whether they deserve very significant salaries?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir David Nicholson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Not just this Government’s but the previous Government’s policy on pay was straightforward, in the sense that there was fairly tight control over pay in the arm’s length bodies. In NHS England, for example, the organisation I am responsible for, pay is constrained; it works in line with the overall Government pay strategy and all the rest of it. In foundation trusts and CCGs, it is up to each individual organisation to decide how much it will spend on pay, how much it will pay the people who lead it and all the rest of it. There is a distinct—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q7 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara Keeley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you regard those senior salaries as constrained?

If you are talking about the pay for the jobs themselves, of course we do not set our own pay; I do not set my own pay.

I asked you to comment on a comment made by a very senior NHS manager this morning that senior managers “deserve very significant salaries”. That is what he said. In the context that I have described, the debate that is going on, he said that those very senior managers “deserve” significant salary increases. That is what I wish you to comment on.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir David Nicholson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I will make a couple of observations on that. The first one is that in the rest of this conversation, I guess, we will talk about some of the biggest and most significant transformational change the NHS has ever seen. We need really good, top-drawer people to lead that. If we constantly denigrate and criticise them, it is hardly surprising that they respond to that. We all have a responsibility to support those people, in incredibly difficult jobs.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara Keeley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> And incredibly highly paid jobs.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir David Nicholson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Absolutely. I am saying absolutely that they are highly paid jobs. The second thing is that I have been in the NHS for 35 years and have only ever once applied for a job that was not associated with a reorganisation. If people would stop constantly reorganising the NHS, we would have less of the turbulence that we have. In terms of the individual pay of people who are part of very senior managers’ pay, a system was set up, not by me but by the Government—signed off by Ministers—that put every job through a rigorous external evaluation that set out what the job was and put a salary against it. That was not done by the people themselves, and that is what people have got. We should not be surprised by the salaries that they have got.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q9 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara Keeley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> There is no question of denigration. I am asking you about a very senior manager who, when asked about salary policy—these issues—this morning said that those very senior managers on the very high salaries I have talked about “deserve…significant salaries”. It is very lucky if you have worked for 35 years and have only ever had to apply for one job; 6,000 nurses have been made redundant and have lost their jobs.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir David Nicholson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I have applied for lots of jobs. The point I was trying to make was that I applied for those jobs not because I thought I might want them—normally it was because the organisation I worked for had been abolished because of some reorganisation that had been dreamed up somewhere in the NHS.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q10 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara Keeley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You are talking to the wrong side of the room about reorganisations, because we are not over-happy with this either. I want to know whether you think that it is appropriate for somebody on a very senior salary himself to say that those senior managers on salaries between £155,000 and £210,000, which is your level, deserve that significant salary rise at a time when we are talking about pay restraint down to people on very small amounts—people on £21,000. Do those people, who also have to worry about being made redundant, not deserve the salaries they are on?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir David Nicholson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think people deserve the pay that the system we set up identifies they should get. All that Bruce Keogh was talking about was that there is a very rigorous process—the very senior managers’ pay job evaluation—that is done externally and sets the pay.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q11 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara Keeley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> He did not say that. His comment was that they deserve it. I think that what he said and the tone of that are just wrong. Around pay restraint, it is a mistake for a person paid at the topmost rates in an organisation to say that he and his colleagues deserve what they earn, as if everybody else did not. Frankly, you will have a lot of issues on this pay restraint issue and on dealing with drift, as it has been called, at the lower levels if people at the very top, on these very significant salaries, think that they deserve it—as if other people did not.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir David Nicholson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: All I have said—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q12 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara Keeley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you agree?

You will remember the management cost ceilings that people had in the past and all the rest of it. The last Government relaxed all of that, largely because there was a real complexity about how you would define what a senior manager was and what a senior manager was not. People got involved in all sorts of arrangements around that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">This time, we took the view that the real control we need to hold on to relates to the running costs of the commissioning side of the NHS. On the provider side, it is a matter for foundation trusts what management costs they have and how many people they have. Most of them are locally accountable now. It is their job to account to their local population for what they do; that is the control over them.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In terms of NHS England and the CCGs, we took a view on how much we would spend on running costs. We concluded that we could reduce that by about a third. That is what we have been doing—over the last two or three years we have been implementing those arrangements. Even if you reduce the numbers but then try to employ management consultants to fill the gap, that still counts against running costs. In those circumstances, they would not show in the savings. Over the last three years we have saved £1.5 billion of running costs across NHS England and the CCGs.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q18 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Valerie Vaz:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I appreciate that that is a very important saving, but you have not answered my question.

A number of times we have discussed in this Committee and with you the importance of moving towards integration of health and social care. It strikes us that one of the problems is that, since the Health and Social Care Act, reconfigurations have actually become more difficult. Could you comment on how you feel we can change this? Is there something within the legislation that needs to change so that these processes can become more streamlined and we are not just bogged down in this morass?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir David Nicholson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think there are two aspects to it. One of them is those things that are under our control and could help. I mean particularly the payment system, the contractual system and all the rest of it. We are committed to changing those to enable people to make it happen. In our planning guidance for next year, we will give people much more flexibility around the payment systems that they use. We have already started that. We want to do that because we think it is the right thing. We do not want a position where a good integration plan set out by a local health and social community is stopped because of things that we have created—the payment system or whatever. We are committed to doing that. That is the first thing.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q59 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Wollaston:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> But within the legislation, there is the whole process of setting about achieving a reconfiguration. We have seen a number of these held up, rejected and going through the courts.

The first is the whole issue of competition policy, procurement and all of that. We have put out guidance to CCGs around procurement. I think we have a problem, which may need legislative change to make it happen. If I think back to the conversations we had with the most senior politicians in the Government around the reforms and changes that we are having, they were very clear that the intent behind all of this was that competition was there to serve, not to control. One of the things that we constantly said was that competition was a tool to improve quality, to be used when commissioners felt it was the right thing to do, not something that would be brought in externally; indeed, much of the conversation around the powers of Monitor was about making that the case.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">For whatever reason, legislatively and in practice, that is not what is happening. What is happening at the moment—you all know cases as well as I do—as people move to using lawyers in all of this, we are in my view getting bogged down in a morass of competition law, which is causing significant cost in the system. We do not have a total for that, but undoubtedly we will find it in time. More than that, it is causing great frustration for people in the service about making change happen. That may be because of the way in which we are interpreting the law—we are talking to Monitor—but it may be because that is the law, in which case to make integration happen we will need to change it.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q60 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Wollaston:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Can you set out to us which of those you think it is?

Once you start asking for legal advice, you get yourself into a whole set of legal arguments and controversy. Irrespective of where I, David Bennett or anyone else is, that is where people have got to. You have competition lawyers all over the place telling us what to do, which is causing enormous difficulty.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q61 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Wollaston:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> That is what we warned of.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir David Nicholson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: To solve that—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q62 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Rosie Cooper:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Was that a surprise to you?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir David Nicholson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It certainly was not the intent.

We think that will be part of the evidence either to make sure that the regulations that we set at the centre are much less open to misinterpretation or legal wrangle—that would be the best option, because it would be the quickest way of doing it—or, otherwise, to get a change in the law to enable us to get out of this particular problem.

This is something that has been going on all the time, and everybody knows it is going on.

Let us get to the integration and transformation fund. You have described the competition bit, but on the ground a lot of people feel that there is nobody really in charge any more, which is why they go to lawyers—they do not know what is going on.

It rather reminds me of the conversation we had with Barbara Hakin and everybody else—it is an ephemeral thing, but nobody has actually nailed it down. The question is, when will it start, what will the governance be like, who will be around the table, and do you think that health and wellbeing boards are really equipped to do it right now—not that they will not be, but right now?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir David Nicholson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The integration fund is a big step. First, it is not new money—it is existing money that is being changed. It is a big step change. It is a highly ambitious thing to do—some might regard it as risky—to shift money in this way. It will provoke a whole lot of change in health and social care. We need to harness that for positive. I know I have spoken to this Committee on a number of occasions about all of our frustration about the fact that everyone thinks that integration is a good thing and everyone says that they are doing bits of it, but it has not actually made the big difference that it could make for patients and families.

We need to get the governance absolutely right. While the press releases around it said that the health and wellbeing boards would be the organisation, I have said that we need to be satisfied that the governance is right. I think some health and wellbeing boards are fantastic and do great things, but some of them are not. I remain—or rather, my successor will remain—the accounting officer for that money. It is not a question of just giving it to local government and saying, “Do your best.” I and my successor need to be satisfied that the governance is right. I understand the thing about health and wellbeing boards, but unless they are properly organised, we have got the governance right and we have proper engagement of providers and others in all of this, I certainly will not sign any—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q72 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Rosie Cooper:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> When will they come in, and how will you ensure it happens?

What are they going to do? How is it going to happen?” My question to you is very simply, when will it start and how you will you be sure that you have everybody around the table? If you do not, it is pointless—there will just be more rows. Also, how will that governance actually happen?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir David Nicholson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The fund itself is set up from 1 April 2015, so we have some time to get it right. We are currently thinking about our planning guidance and how we will take all of this forward. By the end of this year, we will set out the arrangements that we would expect at a local level and a mechanism for assuring ourselves that that governance is right.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q73 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Rosie Cooper:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I agree with you—this is an absolute game changer. It is a substantial, ring-fenced budget for out-of-hospital care. If you get it wrong and this goes, the whole system will rock. Your providers—not necessarily the right ones; it depends on who is mates with whom—will go to the wall. I really worry—with due respect to GPs—that some may find it a way of paying themselves more, indirectly, and will create neighbourhood models that invest in primary care, with social services, without really showing that what they are doing will reduce the demand for hospital care. Believe me, I have recent experience of it, and it is scary.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir David Nicholson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Ok</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">ay</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q74 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Could we be clear about the £3.8 billion? Am I right in thinking that it is a minimum and that, where there is an opportunity for transformational change, the figure could be larger than that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Baumann</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes. I think that in a large number of health economies that is exactly what would happen. The £3.8 billion is a minimum—it is a kind of bridgehead into this thing. Certainly the sorts of CCGs I have been talking to recently are all already moving well beyond that into thinking about bigger pooling of money. That is the first important thing.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The second thing—to address your point about the providers being around the table—is that this is very much part of a five-year planning process that the letter you referred to is setting up. We have done some groundbreaking work in setting up a five-year planning process that absolutely does have commissioners—whether NHS England or CCGs—all of the providers and the local authority people around a single table trying to shape the future of each of those health economies, in which this particular fund either in its minimum form or in a bigger form, if they choose to take it that way, will be a key liberating factor. I do not think we will have the dislocation you talk about.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q75 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Rosie Cooper:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Okay. Let us look at it from another angle. The Nicholson challenge was regarded as huge. I do not know of any other health economy in the world that has managed to do it. As you said, Sir David, this is not new money: ergo, it is coming out of health. That almost implies, especially for providers, that they will have to have an extra productivity gain of 2% or 3%. That is now £6 billion-plus a year. How will that feed its way through without damaging quality, basically?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir David Nicholson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: You are absolutely right to say all of that. The vast majority of that—certainly of the £2 billion of the £3.8 billion—will come out of the acute sector; there is no other source for it. In other conversations we have had, we have said that a large proportion of people who are in acute hospitals either do not need to be there, because if they had had better services upstream they would have avoided the admission, or who could be got out more quickly. We have said it for a long time, worked on it incrementally, done bits and pieces of it and all the rest of it. This means you have to do it in a big, significant step.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I know Paul and I have had conversations about this. If you just put a 7% or 8% efficiency gain to every acute hospital, that would end in failure. We need to identify the capacity in acute hospitals that can be provided outside, and then we need a managed and controlled way of taking it from one to the other. It has to be done, and we have 18 months to do it. That, in a sense, is why it is a game changer. It moves from a general discussion about the theory of all of this to having a practical plan to make it happen.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q76 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Rosie Cooper:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I have three very quick but really important points. If £2 billion is to be taken out of the NHS, in essence, and given to local authorities to shore up social services, because that is a real problem, I do not understand why Government have cut so much from local authority budgets. In the letters and notes of yours that I have read, you say this represents a cliff edge for the NHS and that by bringing the savings forward you will avoid the NHS dropping off the edge. For me, that is like saying that, instead of your getting shot at dawn, the executioner will bring the time forward to midnight. It is an efficiency hit on the NHS on top of that which it already has. I just cannot see how you can maintain quality while you do that. Finally, is the £2 billion a down payment? Are you confident that that £2 billion will really lever out £20 billion-worth of savings?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir David Nicholson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: If what happens is that we just take £2 billion out of the acute sector and give it to local government to shore up its services, all the things that you have said will happen. Quality will go down and in the NHS we will be involved in managed decline. Nobody wants that to happen. That £2 billion absolutely has to go into providing out-of-hospital care in innovative ways that lots of people out there are absolutely dying to get on and do. That is the first thing in all of that. I think it is perfectly possible to do it, although it will take an effort beyond what we have done.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The other side of that, of course, is that there will be consequences to it in terms of the configuration of acute services. You cannot take £2 billion out of acute services and expect them just to continue with £2 billion less. They will have to reconfigure the way in which they deliver services. For that to happen, you will have to get the buy-in of local government, because you cannot make those changes without local government. In a sense, this forces together health and local government in a way we have never seen before, but we have to do it. It is a—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q77 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Rosie Cooper:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> But you have to get the buy-in of the people who are actually paying for the NHS. The health and wellbeing boards must be properly equipped, experienced and mature enough to do it, the CCGs must be at the table, the providers must be there and it must be done reflecting the health needs of the area. You also really have to guarantee that governance. Without that, this is off the cliff edge.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir David Nicholson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I agree with all of that.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q78 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Rosie Cooper:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So how are you going to make it? That is what I am not hearing. I know that we have 18 months, but I just do not feel—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir David Nicholson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We are organising people to do it at the moment. We have said to everyone that they need to think about what their service will look like in five years’ time. They are all working on that at the moment across the NHS. We are asking them what their strategy is for the next five years, given the background of what I have said, and to set that out. We are also asking each of them to come up with a two-year operational plan by the end of March, which will set out what service shape will look like in 2014-15 and 2015-16. It is the first time we are asking for that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We have got Monitor, the NHS Trust Development Authority and all of the arm’s length bodies to sign up to help and support people to do that. They are already working on that. We also want to put aside a significant amount of resource to support and help them to do it, because there is no doubt that this is a big ask for these organisations, some of which are relatively new. We are putting money aside to support and help them to do it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Baumann</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: One of the key areas we will focus that support on is precisely the area you have just talked about—understanding the needs of the population—to enable them to engage with the public and patients in the communities. That is something where there are variable degrees of maturity, shall we say, in different health economies, so it is one of the key areas where we will put in a significant amount of resource to make sure that that happens.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There is the broad planning process, which we will carry out over the coming few months. The conditionalities and structures around the integration and transformation fund itself are really very tight. There is very specific conditionality around the £3.8 billion, or whatever number bigger than that it becomes, in terms of things like those David referred to earlier—the buy-in of the local authority and, indeed, all the partners to the consequences for capacity adaptation. There are also very specific metrics that are a key part of that, in terms of, if we do all of these things, what will be the reduction in emergency admissions? That is the kind of rigour that we are putting into the plans behind the fund, within the broader strategic plans. That should enable us to track it with really strong governance, which is obviously important.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q79 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Rosie Cooper:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So you are absolutely sure that you will get your £20 billion saving.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Baumann</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Of course, the £20 billion takes us through only to the end of this particular cycle. Without wishing to make the problem bigger, it is £30 billion over the seven years through to 2021. This is an important part of getting that particular process kick-started. It would be foolish of me to suggest that we already have the £30 billion in the bag and it is just a question of churning out a set of things. This is very much a process that the strategic plans that we are doing and the ITF will lead us to.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Barbara, Valerie and Sarah want to come in, so we need to speed it up a little bit.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q80 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara Keeley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It has been useful to touch on this, but perhaps I will take it to a different outlook. We will have the Care Bill here soon—in the next few weeks, hopefully. Meetings and seminars I have attended are starting to build a lot of concern about the pressures on local authorities from the new functions that they will have under that Bill. We are already in a funding crisis of social care that is worse than the funding crisis we have had for a long time. It is interesting that you draw out that this is existing and not new money. Something called an integration and transformation fund sounds wonderful, particularly with that amount of money. In reality, as you say, it is about £1.9 billion from the NHS. The rest is planned transfers—things such as funding for adaptations and carers’ breaks, which already exist.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir David Nicholson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes, we already transfer that money to local government.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q81 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara Keeley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Indeed. The funding for those carers’ breaks and for adaptations is being spent at the moment, so it really is not new money, which is very important. In fact, having looked at this, I end up with the view that actually there is not enough money for a whole lot of change. I think this Committee would want to see a change and would probably want to see more funding. I note sentences such as the one that is buried in the letter about it—“requirements of the fund are likely to significantly exceed existing pooled budget arrangements”. There is a danger that, with the new functions under the Care Bill, the existing pressures and the expectations that will build up around this, people will think there is a lot of money being transferred into this. Actually, it seems to me that there is not.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I do not think we will see anything like the amount of change that we as a Committee would want to see, unless there is more funding. If anything, I think that here, particularly around the Care Bill, we need a proper debate about the fact that the pressures are enormous. By the time you get to spending the £1.9 billion you talked about in 2015, that and more than that will already have gone from local authority social care budgets, which is probably what is precipitating part of the A and E crisis. That became clear to us when we looked at the A and E crisis. In some ways, we need to focus on the fact that it is not new money, that it is not enough money and that it will not do a whole lot of change unless there is more.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sir David Nicholson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: One of the reasons I wrote the letter was because I thought there was almost a developing understanding in the service, first, that somehow this was new money, when it is not—everyone was getting very excited about what to spend it on, as opposed to how to generate it in the first place, which is at least as important, if not more so—and secondly, that somehow it was just a transfer to shore up local government, which it absolutely is not; it cannot work if it is. The reason for the letter was to make that absolutely clear to the service, so people were under no illusions about it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The point I would make is that we had a period when we had lots of growth and talked about integration but never actually did it—even though we had a lot of money. What this does is make it absolutely essential. The NHS cannot survive unless it massively integrates services across health and social care in the next period. That, in a sense, is the new thing that it gives—an impetus to this that we have never had before. It is not a nice thing to do—it is vital.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q82 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara Keeley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> But is it enough impetus? When you look across it, you kind of think, “Fine, but really you might need twice as much to do a good job of integration.” It is just that sense of the fact that this is a system in crisis. Nobody would want to start on integrating health and social care when one side had just suffered a period of four or five years of swingeing cuts. Yesterday, the LGA said that the further cuts scheduled for 2015-16 are not tenable. My local authority is changing its eligibility. By the end of this year, we will be in a situation of maybe thousands of people not getting the care packages they were getting before.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">One of the things that we have raised here before but must be studied over the next year is exactly what is happening in the NHS because of those cuts to social care. In some ways, that is a justification for this transfer, and more transfers, if it is understood, but the LGA is now turning around and saying, “You can’t keep cutting this funding.

What you do not see is the scale. That is why the Department started off down the road of looking at how we can get these ideas better understood and implemented across the country. There are two ways in which we plan to do that. One is through the pioneers. The Department has identified, I think, 14 pioneers that will work through these integration models in much more detail, because the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Torbay</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> model will not necessarily be able to be picked up and used elsewhere.

I think the model they have there and the massive investment in community and primary care services they plan to do, with the development of seven-day services, will be a model for the country as a whole. When we have put proposals to the Government, they have been supported, but there is no shortcut for this.

If you compare what we are doing with the rest of the developed world in health care, no one is doing it quite in the way we are doing it. Most other countries are either going for a dramatic reduction in the pay of their staff—in places such as Ireland, there are 15% to 20% reductions in pay—or going for a reduction in the offer, so people are having to pay out of their own pocket for more, as in Spain, Portugal and Greece. What we are saying is that, within a universally available, free-at-the-point-of-use service, we are going to live within the resources that we have, without draconian reductions in pay—although we will have to constrain it—on the one hand, but keeping the offer the same. That is unique.

I want to touch on the unpopular issue of planning and the impact of policy changes on resource allocation and then on service delivery. Sir David, last month, you wrote to clinical commissioning groups giving details of the allocations for 2014-15 and 2015-16. I am very concerned about what the implications of any changes to the resource allocation funding formula are likely to be.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In particular, I know that the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">BMJ</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is saying that we have the worst north-south health divide for 40 years. One of the changes that are proposed in relation to the allocation per head has a considerable adverse effect on areas such as mine and on some of the more deprived, poorer areas. For example, my constituency loses £62 per head. In Sunderland, it is even more—£146 per head. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Cumbria</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> loses £118 a head.

Do you think that the existing mechanisms are providing sufficient resources on the basis of need?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Baumann</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Shall I tackle this, as it happens to be my particular responsibility? First, I will provide a bit of clarification. I think you are referring to what we published in the summer, which is what the allocations would have been had we adopted the proposals that went to the board back in December of last year. They are not the proposals for 2014-15 and 2015-16, just to make that crystal clear. The decision on that will be taken this coming December at the board. The thoughts leading up to that decision have been engaged upon over the last two or three months with about 300 or 400 people around the country, just to try to work out the best way through the set of dilemmas that we have around allocation. That is the first point to make.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The second point is that we are trying to balance in the allocations three or four things that have countervailing effects, all of which need to have their proper prominence in the allocation process. One of them is that currently we have allocations that are based on populations that are at least three or four years out of date, because we have not had any pace of change in recent years. Quite simply, we have a dislocation in what is currently in the system between the populations that people are now serving and the money that they are getting to do that. The second thing is that we have to put proper weight on deprivation and inequality. It is central to the mission of NHS England and to the mission of the commissioning system. The allocation formulas that we will talk about in December fully weight all of that deprivation. I will come back to the evidence of that in a second. The third thing is that we need to deal with the fact that we have ageing populations. Age is a significant factor in the needs of local populations for health care.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The formulas that we have developed factor all of that in fully. We have a particular issue around unmet need, which I am sure you will be familiar with from previous discussions around allocation. In the proposals we took to the board last year, we took the view that it was not appropriate to make an adjustment for that. In the proposals we take to the board this December, we will explain what the consequence would be of reinserting, if you like, an adjustment for unmet need, which we think, on balance, is probably an appropriate thing to do. We will be putting proposals to that effect.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Just to give some reassurance that this is not a system that equalises the needs across the north and the south, if you like, and makes deprived boroughs work with the same resources that less-deprived boroughs work with, if you take the most deprived decile in the country and the highest-paid CCG in that decile, which happens to be Knowsley, and if you take the lowest in the first decile, which happens to be Richmond upon Thames—I am guessing that there cannot be a much wider spectrum of places—the difference between those two allocations per head as proposed, including a deprivation adjustment, is about 44%. When you adjust for purchasing power between </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Richmond</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> upon </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Thames</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and Knowsley, that goes up to 67%. So for people who need reassurance that deprivation is properly and fully factored into any formulas that we are happy discussing, that is the evidence for it.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That is what we are doing. In parallel—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q117 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Grahame M. Morris:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> If you will excuse my interrupting, the risk is that if we follow the same policy in principle as has been applied in local government, for example, we will see a transfer of resources from the poorest, most deprived areas to the wealthiest areas or to the least deprived areas. What is NHS England’s view on that? It looks as if the areas that have the best health outcomes—you have identified </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Richmond</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> upon </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Thames</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—are going to have the highest allocations of resources. Is that fair?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Baumann</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I can guarantee that that will not be the case in our allocations. The example I have just given is the proof that that is not what we are proposing. The most deprived boroughs in the country will get the most money. The least deprived boroughs in the country, subject to those other two factors of population and age, will get the least money. You will see that spectrum when we set out the allocations. It was already there to a large extent in the ones you are commenting on, but it will become clearer, I think, with the possible deprivation adjustment that we are going to make.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It is not the case that we give less money to the deprived areas and more money to the south—quite the opposite. The issue is that, when you compare it with a formula that is now several years out of date and that has not kept pace with the population and with the ageing in that population, there will be changes. Unless we preserve everything on the basis of what we happened to have in 2006, which was probably the last time we had any significant move in the formula, there will at some point need to be changes. I think the formula sets that out in a sensible way.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The other decision the board has in December is how fast to move from what we currently have to whatever this formula, with a deprivation adjustment, would suggest. I think it is obvious that, at a time when there is not an awful lot of growth around to put into the equation, the speed at which we can make those sorts of changes will be quite measured, because to do anything other would be problematic.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q118 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Grahame M. Morris:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I understand that and am grateful for those answers. In an earlier answer to one of my colleagues in relation to NHS redundancies, Sir David said, “Well, stop doing the reorganisations.” The point was that, if we had a period of stability and did not have constant turbulence, it would be easier to plan; I tend to agree with that analysis. Isn’t there benefit in applying that logic to the CCG allocations? I have a situation now where various groups are lobbying for resources to be applied to tackle particular health problems. The CCGs need some stability and clarity in terms of their allocations so that they can plan and participate in the efficiency savings and address local health needs.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Baumann</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: That is very much the consideration that the board will take in December. It was very mindful of that when it took its decision last year, because in the first year, in particular, we did not want too much disruption. The only thing I do need to point out is that there is a price attached to any kind of trade-off that we make in all of this. The stability comes at the price of the fact that at the moment there are a whole lot of CCGs that cannot make ends meet because they are so vastly away from what the formula would suggest. If I look at it just in terms of the half-year stock take of finances that we look at, there are 37 CCGs around the country that are at high risk of having a deficit this year. They have not all got to the point of having a deficit, but there are 37 at high risk of having a deficit. Thirty-one of those are significantly under target compared with the formulas that we are going to produce for the board in December. I give that just as an example.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">If you look at the provider sector, which is clearly a little bit outwith our direct responsibility, there are about 42 distressed providers out there at the moment that you will have read about and be concerned about.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q119 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Grahame M.

There is a larger preponderance of NHS trusts than of foundation trusts, but there is a selection of both. Thirty of those 42 are in health economies that are currently under-funded by the formulas. None of this is absolute, I am afraid. There are dilemmas in all of this as to where you do the trade-offs between stability and getting the money to where it is needed and so on, and how you do the trade-offs between the things we have to factor in around deprivation, age and population.

Compared with any proposals that we had last December, at least one of the proposals on the table in December will have an additional deprivation adjustment for unmet need that those did not have. That will tend, just by the natural geography of deprivation, to cause a swing back in the way you describe. That is not the same as saying that that set of allocations will be identical to the ones that we had before this process started.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q121 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Rosie Cooper:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You obviously know those figures.

What it does is make sure that at the extremes of deprivation, from the first to the 10th decile, there is a similar set and span of adjustments to what there was in the old system, as it happens. What happened in between, because the way we are doing the deprivation adjustment is now significantly more sensitive than what was put into the old system, is that it has a different distribution between those two extremes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It is not possible for me to highlight a pattern to that that is simple, but we will set all of that out very clearly as part of our decision making.

The point is that we did not do the big swing. People this year—in 2013-14—have got the same amount, plus a uniform increase for inflation, as they had under the old system. At the December board last year, we said that we did not have enough confidence in the changes we were making, for all the reasons we have just been debating, to make the big swing that you are describing. We therefore took the 2013-14 allocations and indexed them all by a standard amount to reflect the increase—2.3%—for CCGs. That is the starting point. When we come to December, we are saying that we are going to describe the potential target formulas, including the deprivation adjustment as an option within that. We will compare that with what people currently have. That is where the judgments come in, which are, what is the pace of change? As I have tried to intimate, we are going to be quite careful about that, because the less growth you have, the less flexibility there is to make that painless.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q125 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Rosie Cooper:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So you are saying that there has been no big change from 2010-11, 2011-12 and 2012-13.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Baumann</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: That is true.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q126 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Wollaston:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> There certainly has not been a change in my area, I happen to know, which is affected by rural poverty.

I was slightly amused by the expression “distressed providers” that was just used to talk about the trusts that are in deficit. Thirty out of 62 acute trusts are expected to be in deficit by the end of this year. You obviously understand fully the position about those difficulties, with increasing numbers of trusts really being in breach of their terms of authorisation and, presumably, needing increased amounts of financial support. How concerned are you about that? Does it really mean—as an MP I certainly see examples of this—that those foundation trusts will be focusing on maintaining services, rather than on those other important challenges we talked about earlier, such as integration? How can a financially crippled organisation really start to move forward on important work of integration or, in fact, reconfiguration?

It would be wrong to say that there is a single model of what the problem is in each of those 42 trusts, but in a fair number of them, effectively, I do not think the solution lies purely in becoming more productive, becoming more efficient or whatever—I think it lies in the structure of their services and the way that needs to change. So I think they have more incentive rather than less.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q140 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara Keeley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> But those are difficult. We have already heard about a trust trying to avoid a change and using competition regulations to do that. If people are not accepting what they need to do to get back to financial health and are fighting it, there is a struggle going on, isn’t there?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Baumann</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: That is where we all have different roles in this process, haven’t we? For us, we need to make sure that there are the conditions of success for a trust sector. As you know, the trust sector in total is in surplus at the moment, so at one level that’s it. As NHS England—I think we need to be specific about our role in this, as opposed to the role of, for example, the Trust Development Authority, which is the steward of many of these organisations—our role is to support transformation, where there are transformation plans to support. We as NHS England and the CCGs around the country are deploying substantial amounts of money to support trusts where, for example, transformation costs are required to reduce costs in some way, to merge with other trusts or to support changes in service. We are putting financial investment in to do that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">However, it is not our role to eliminate deficits, as it were, by just putting money where a deficit arises. In many ways, if we were to do that, we would dampen the incentive to do something about these significant changes. We have a very transparent system in place, where the deficit funding comes through cash that the Department of Health provides to keep the trust able to pay its payroll and so on, so that it can focus on the recovery task that we talked about, whether operational or strategic. Our role is very much to fund the transition and transformation in health economies to make sure that they get to the right place.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q141 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara Keeley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Let us move on to the situation where £250 million has been put into winter pressures, particularly as a result of the A and E crisis—which persisted across the summer, with trolley waits and missed waiting targets. To what extent are the difficulties experienced last winter or the ones expected for this winter, including in places where extra funding has been given, related to the funding situation? I know that this whole situation has been looked at over the summer. Does it seem that part of the crisis was related to the funding situation of any of those trusts that had the worst results and to which you have given extra funding? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul Baumann</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: So, the—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Barbara Keeley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I would like to hear David Nicholson’s answer to this.

You can often find that there is a connection between not being able to hit your A and E target and not managing your organisation very well overall; you can see that connection. If you look at the money that has been given out—the £250 million this year—there is a correlation, although not a complete correlation, with where there are financial difficulties in the NHS.

I wonder whether we could refer this to the PAC, because there are serious issues to answer about the way the Property Services company was set up, at a time when Sir David was overseeing the reforms, whether it was disposing of those assets at, or significantly below, market value and why the Department of Health thought it was acceptable not to disclose the names of those it was selling the properties to in the first instance.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> These are obviously questions.
