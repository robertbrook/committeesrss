The 1993 system failed, as did the 2003 system. What makes you think—I am looking for a short, headline answer on this one, because we have lots of questions for you—that this incarnation of child support will be any better than the previous two failed attempts?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Steve Webb:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think the big difference is that this is not just a different set of definitions, a different set of rules; it is a completely different philosophy. Our central proposition is that we want to enable and encourage families to sort things out for themselves</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">wherever possible. Let me put something on the record at the start, because every time we say that, people say to us, “But I know so-and-so—they couldn’t possibly sort it out for themselves.” We are absolutely not saying that everyone can sort it out for themselves. We are flipping it the other way round and saying, “Let’s have a presumption that we try and help people sort things out for themselves.” </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Our research shows that half a million families currently using the Child Support Agency have told us that with the right help and support, they probably could have sorted or could sort things out for themselves. So by trying to enable people to do that, we are getting good outcomes for families and children among people who never get into our system, and then we can concentrate on what we perhaps do best, or what we try to do best, which is trying to make sure that where people are not willing to co-operate, we make that happen. That is not a static situation, though: we are constantly trying to move people towards more collaborative ways of working. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The other thing, briefly, is that the streamlining of information-gathering—our link with HMRC—means that instead of having a non-resident parent, or what we call now a paying parent, who does not provide information, we get earnings data and so on straight from HMRC, within a matter of days. We are doing assessments much quicker, and because we are using that data, every year there is an automatic updating. So instead of cases going stale and provision for people being based on very out-of-date information, we are keeping these things updated. What we are not doing, because we are doing it regularly and systematically, is </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">faffing</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and fiddling around with tiny little changes in circumstances. All of us know about letters saying, for example, “On the 5th of May, this happened, and then so-and-so moved out of the house, and then the wage went up”—and you are 17 changes of circumstances down the track. We won’t be doing that. We will be making changes only where there is a big change; otherwise, there will be an annual update. As a result, much more of our time and effort will go on the cases that need to be dealt with and on doing it much more efficiently.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What do you think the time scale is for you to know that it is going okay, or that it is not—it is going the way of previous attempts?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Steve Webb:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> As you know, we have adopted a pathfinder approach, so we started with families of four children or more last December; we went to families with two or more children in July; and then on Monday of this week we opened it to all new cases. Clearly, it is early days. It was a few hundred a month when we started; in the summer, it was a few thousand cases a month; now it is about 10,000 or so cases a month. It is early days. We can’t say yet, “It’s a success.”</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q3</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> This time next year?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Steve Webb:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What I was going to say was that we have to be very careful. We have internal stats about what is going on, but they are fairly rough and ready—they are not audited and all that kind of stuff—and we get criticised if we put stats out before we are sure they are absolutely right. We do not even have a case load yet that represents the case load we are dealing with. I certainly think that by this time next year, we will have a much clearer picture of how many people we have been able to support to make a family-based arrangement, how many are coming through, and how many are on Direct Pay, which is better than enforcement. We will have a much clearer picture by then.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q4</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> If you are starting to get that kind of picture, you must know what measures have been put in place to make sure that the funding of the new system is adequate. How are you going to make sure that you have the balance right in terms of chasing the errant parent as opposed to the Options—as opposed to the mandatory Gateway?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Steve Webb:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I will ask Ian to say a word about that in a moment, but the basic idea is this. Options, as you say, do a fantastic job. I went up and visited them recently. They are really committed to supporting families at a difficult time and they will be fully resourced by us to deal with all the people who are coming in. That will be the route in, so you do not just, as it were, ring the CSA—that has gone. You will ring us and we will put you through to Options, where you will have a conversation, and we will resource that fully for the calls that come in. Ideally, we help: we signpost people to support services—we are piloting some of our own that we will talk about—and then far fewer people will ever get through to the statutory scheme than in the past.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q5</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> But that is my point: you do not know yet, so how do you know how you are going to break down that funding, and how to measure the effectiveness of your funding in those different areas?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Steve Webb:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Obviously, we have modelled these things, and as each week goes by, we will refine that modelling, but we have resourced it for our best estimate of the volumes that we will have. Shall I give Ian a chance to say a word on that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Ian Wright:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> There are probably a couple of things that it’s worth my picking up. One of your first questions related particularly to the system. I think one reason for people’s nervousness relates to the implementation of the system to support the 2003 scheme. There were major problems thereafter, and it took us a number of years to recover from that. We have done a number of things differently with the implementation of this system. First, rather than going out to a supplier and asking them to bespoke it—develop a new system just for us—we went out to the marketplace and bought systems that were well tried and tested. We have plugged those together. Where possible, we have built automatic interfaces to various organisations: HMRC, Jobcentre Plus et cetera.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">One of the other failings with the previous system was that we tried to migrate data from the old scheme to the new scheme, as it was then. We are doing very little of that, so again we are learning the lessons from the past. Also, we consciously implemented this in a pathfinder way, so that we could make sure the system was working before we ramped up the volumes. Even though we went live with a small number of volumes, this system has been live since December of last year, and from all accounts it has been very quiet in terms of any major issues, which I regard as a success. So there are a number of things from a system perspective—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think it is on that point that Nigel wants to ask you a question.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q6</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Nigel Mills:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Can you just talk us through how the link to HMRC works? Obviously, we have been discussing that in relation to universal credit, and it is not quite as straightforward as we might have thought. Are you doing roughly the same thing as is being done there?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Steve Webb:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Let me just clarify something. We do not need real-time information month by month. When someone makes an application, we need to know from HMRC the latest data on their record at that point—from tax returns, for example. It is not as if, every month, we are checking, checking, checking. We do it once on the application, then we do it on the anniversary, so in general we are not constantly needing to get a feed. Ian, do you want to say something?</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Ian Wright:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes. Effectively, when we get information on the prospective paying parent, we type that into the system and it goes off to HMRC to establish whether there is income data from the previous year for that particular person. If yes, it brings it back and we do a provisional calculation; we then send that out to both parents, to say, “This is the information we have. This is the provisional calculation.” What that typically does is inspire a telephone call back from the potential paying parent. Where the data exist, that is the calculation, and we have a similar methodology for a potential paying parent who is on benefits, which links in with Jobcentre Plus. So for a large proportion of paying parents we are able to generate a provisional calculation, normally within a matter of days.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q7</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Nigel Mills:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> With the functionality there, when you perhaps have a somewhat non-co-operative prospective paying parent who has said, “I am not working, so you can’t collect any money,” is there a way the system alerts you that the person is now earning again, so that the calculation is retriggered?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Ian Wright:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So we also have automatic links to credit reference agencies, where we can see if someone comes into employment, et cetera. There are various automatic links that we can look at to see whether someone’s circumstances have changed—they are automatically linked into the system.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q8</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Nigel Mills:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> They are automatic, so you do not have to go and update my file manually, to check if I am working again.

We know that and we accept it in many cases. There are two things, however. First, relationships change over time. There may be people who, at the point of separation, just cannot sort it out, but two years, four years or six years down the track they might. At the moment, they are in the CSA for as long as the kids are. We are constantly looking, over time, to say, “Are things calmer now? Are things more settled? Are things more stable? Can we move to a more collaborative arrangement?” We know from research that, not just on child maintenance but on everything else, children do best if we can foster collaboration rather than conflict. That is what we are trying to do at every stage. We entirely accept that the point of separation can be very bitter and angry.

Some £20 million has been invested in the support available for separated families, but there has been criticism from a number of quarters that that is simply not enough money to do the job.

The money is help and support for separated families, pilot projects, research, telephony networks, websites and all that kind of stuff. Just to give you a feel, because I think you want to talk about this, we have an innovation fund with roughly £10 million of projects. Round 1 is up and running and in the field. Coming back to Sheila’s point, we have projects on, for example, families that have just separated, on teenage lone parents and on particular minority ethnic groups. Coming to your point, Chair, we have some projects that are intensive face-to-face counselling and mediation, and we have some that are 250,000 people on the internet with web chats. We are trying the whole spectrum, and we are benchmarking. Is having two human beings and another person in a room talking to each other for weeks at a time the only way to make those things work, or can you do nearly as good for a millionth of the cost on the internet? We are piloting all this stuff. So we are not saying that it costs £20 million a year to provide help and support for separated families; we are saying that we have this programme designed to look at lots of different ways of supporting people and we will see what works most effectively.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q18</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What is the time scale for evaluating that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Steve Webb:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The round 1 projects are up and running and we would expect to publish findings next year on those.

We are making these deductions from people on potentially fairly basic levels of benefit, so with jobseeker’s allowance at £71-ish a week, that is 10%, which again is broadly the same percentage as when the £5 was brought in. There will be under-25s on lower rates—from memory, that is something like £56—so £10 out of £56 starts to become a very significant figure. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Funnily enough, the feedback we got on the £10 was that even the organisations representing parents with care said, “That looks a bit harsh”.

I hesitate to say “exciting”, but one exciting feature of the new system is that, once up and running, we will have something called self-service. People will be able to log into their child maintenance account and, just like online banking, see the payments made and those received. I know as a constituency MP that I contact the agency sometimes to send through a statement of account, which is a waste of everybody’s time. So people will be able to do that directly. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The calculation itself is pretty much as straightforward as on the 2003 system: it is a percentage according to the number of children and a deduction for children living with you. Shared care cases are a bit more complicated, but those are essentially the key bits. Some of the fiendish CSA assessments were on what we call the ’93 system, the original system, where, frankly, your inside leg measurement changed it. It was absurdly complicated and we do not do that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">any more</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. One of the nice things about the new system will be that we will close the cases on those old systems and move to a much simpler one.

That is the standard approach. I take the point about arrears and of course tax returns themselves, even for employed earners, are out of date, as it were. What we are trying to do is: just once a year do an assessment, a year later catch up. So even if it is not in real time, if they have a bad year and then a good year, eventually we will calculate maintenance on the good year, but there will be a lag, I accept that. In a way, we do not have a better mechanism of assessing the current real standard of living of a self-employed person, because they haven’t done accounts for where they are now, so we would not be able to prove anything.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q28</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dame Angela Watkinson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> If they have had a good year and are experiencing a bad year, they may then be faced with payments which are unaffordable.

The only thing that I would say is, if you are self-employed and your children live with you, the amount of money that you have for your children is going up and down according to your income.

If a self-employed person for the year to April 2013 submits a tax return in January 2014, say online, do you then go back and assess what they should have been paying for the year that covered that self-employment? If they were paying £50 and it should have been £75, and they now owe all these arrears, do you say: “We will use this to work out what you pay from January 2014 onwards”, which becomes that year’s liability, not the historic one?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Steve Webb:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> If someone makes an application and the paying parent is self-employed, we go to HMRC and say: “What is the latest tax return that you’ve got for that individual?” whoever it is, employed or self-employed. We use that number, whatever it is. What we cannot do, if self-employed person X is running a business and the current parent says: “They’re doing really well”, is go in and say: “Show us your books”. We can’t do that. We have to rely on audited accounts and HMRC to check them, which is their job not ours. That will result in some mismatches. There will be times when their current standard of living is not what we are assessing them on, but I do not think there is any other way we can do it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q32</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Nigel Mills:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So you will not go back and say: “For the last year you should have been paying more”?

I’d like to return to the point that we know that over half of the more than one million families currently in the system have said to us, “To be honest, we don’t really need to be in this system. With a bit of help and support, we could have sorted this out for ourselves.” If we can get rid of all the families who with the right support don’t need to be in the system, the taxpayer doesn’t have to pay. Even a bog-standard case still costs us money in correspondence and phone calls and all the rest of it. If we can get all those families who could have sorted things out for themselves to do so, that will save the taxpayer a significant amount of money and be better for the children. That is the first thing.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The second point is that the computer links, particularly with HMRC, mean that the whole process will be much more streamlined.

Because we won’t be spending endless amounts of time </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">faffing</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> with lots of minor changes, tweaks, fiddles and reassessments, which can then be challenged and appealed and all the rest of it, we are spending our money on the thing we need to do.

In a sense that is disproportionately from the heavy-duty enforcement cases. One of the points of the new system is that if we are on a heavy-duty enforcement case, the person who we call the paying parent—who in this case is not paying—is facing a 20% mark-up on their maintenance and has to pay towards the enforcement action that we take. So there will be a much heavier incentive for that person to say, “Look, I don’t want all this extra cost and I don’t want to have to pay for the enforcement”.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q49</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You are saying that there will be fewer of them?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Steve Webb:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q50</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The other thing that occurred to me was the £7 flat rate.

What about whether this was the right outcome, given the experience—I think you were also looking at touch points—of the pilot people you looked at, and whether the soft criteria of the scheme, rather than the nuts and bolts of the process, worked for them?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Susan Park:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So you are absolutely right. The pathfinder approach was to micro-manage each individual case. We started by taking only about 150 applications so we could follow those people through the system as they applied to ensure that at every touch point they were getting the service as we designed it. The other thing that is different about the new service is that we have a customer directorate, which is the voice of the customers. Normally, in traditional civil servant-speak, policy people would sit in a darkened room and come up with lots of lovely policy ideas, and they would probably never take a view about how it works for the client. We did it differently because we had read our history books and we saw what had gone wrong. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Our customer directorate has been working with us to survey the clients as they have walked through. We are absolutely seeing it from the perspective of what it feels like as a customer of the new system. In addition, you could not operate it without the IT system working effectively. You are absolutely right that we have done it from both perspectives. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q57</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Anne Marie Morris:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Give me examples of the sort of things that the customer experienced, which came through, and you said, “Ah, we need to fix that bit of the system because it doesn’t work.” Can you give me some examples of things you changed to make them work better from the customer’s perspective? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Susan Park:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> A good example is procedures. Very quickly, when we get feedback from a customer about a piece of information that we think is not the same as something they have heard on the phone, we will quickly go into our procedures and, because it is real-time, fix it. That is something that the caseworker can see</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">immediately. For example, we were struggling to get people who were taking new applications to ask all the right questions that we included to make it a better experience. Our information was telling us that they were missing some questions, so we updated our procedures and made it one of the checks that we do right at the front end to make sure that we are now asking all of those questions. We were missing stuff at the beginning.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q58</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Anne Marie Morris:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> That all sounds great, but it also sounds quite labour intensive.

As we have changed things, we are sure that it is right. As our clients flow through from new applications into application maintenance and then on to some other part, we are absolutely clear that the processes, procedures and client interface are working. That is what has enabled us to switch up the volumes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q59</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Anne Marie Morris:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I suspect that all of us are finding an increasing number of individuals coming through our doors with regard to matrimonial issues more generally, partly because of the change in legal aid. I appreciate that that change does not impact children and domestic violence, but more people are coming through the doors none the less. The people who are going to be interfacing with you are often going to be CAB or—dare I say—many of us around this table. In the old days, I suspect that it would have been the lawyers who would have been advising and it would have then come to you, so you have a different group of people. How user-friendly and seamless is it going to be to enable non-professionals to work with these individuals or to enable individuals, with no legal understanding or knowledge, to do it for themselves, which I think is what you ideally want? In some cases, they may have heard of the CSA, but they would not know how to find it. If there is a new body, “What is it called?” and “Where is it?” would be the questions. It is about information and access.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Susan Park:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Again, it is one of the things that we learned from reading the history books. We have actually engaged with all the organisations that you just mentioned and have been doing so for a very long time, including getting them to look at the detail of what is written in the letters that go to our clients in this scheme. They have been working hand in glove with us. We recently sat down with a group of 20 such organisations from the community and charitable sectors and some academics as well, and we looked at the other elements of this process. The Minister started at the beginning by saying that this is not all about the statutory scheme. We are trying to do other things to co-ordinate better the services that currently exist, so that they work better together. The organisations are also working very closely with us on that. Specifically and practically, we actually trained some of these people. For the CAB, for example, we provide them with training documents and go in and update their procedures and guidance. We have a whole engagement programme, which is exactly what we are doing right now.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Steve Webb:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> And we will be doing that for your offices, particularly as we start the process of—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q60</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Glenda Jackson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Can we get copies?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Steve Webb:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes.

There was no transition of data, so we did not have the usual data transfer problems. You bought a system, rather than trying to build it from scratch. HMRC was giving you all the information you needed. It sounds like nirvana. My experience from my casework as an MP is that life is never quite nirvana-like. There must have been some glitches and problems. One thing that really frustrates many constituents is the time that it takes to deal with glitches and problems. You must have had such problems, so how are you going to deal with things when they do go wrong? If it has not, I will be amazed. It will.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Steve Webb:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Let me give you an example. In a sense, because we have done the pathfinder, where things have gone wrong, which they have, we have been able to put them right while dealing with handfuls of cases without the whole system falling down. We sometimes take payments by debit card, and we had a problem with our computer talking to the debit card companies’ computers and we were not able to take debit card payments in the normal way, so we just had a manual system until we fixed it properly. The point of the pathfinder is that when we go live, as we have done, we fix that bit. Every week over these 12 months, Ian and his colleagues have produced an excruciatingly detailed note of everything that went wrong with the computer this week, how they fixed it and when they planned to sort it out. That is the point of the pathfinder. Yes, things will go wrong again, but because we’ve tested it to destruction over 12 months, we are as confident as we can be that we have a robust system. We won’t start charging until we’ve been running at full volumes for a period of time and we are confident it is a robust system.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q62</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Anne Marie Morris:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> In this transition—I appreciate it’s a new system, so in a sense you don’t see it as a transition, but for the end user it is a transition—there is going to be a huge number of letters and phone calls from us and from CAB.

We plan to segment roughly a million families and take groups of people together. The first set of people we’re going to take across—this won’t be until into next year when we are confident the system is up and running—will be what we call the nil assessed. These are the people who, at the moment, are assessed as not being liable to pay child maintenance. You might think, what are they doing on the system? I forget the exact figure, but we have taken across tens of thousands of people in that category.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The good news is that some of them, if we had used up-to-date income information, should be paying child maintenance. For example, you are a student, you father a child, and you have zero income and a zero assessment. There is no conversation. Six years later you’re in a well paid job, you ought to be paying child maintenance, but we’ve never caught up. What will happen is that we’ll move all the zeros across first, so nobody’s maintenance will be interrupted, because there </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">ain’t</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> no maintenance flowing, and we’ll say to all those families, “We’re closing down now, here are your options, here is how you can sort things out for yourselves.” In some cases they will talk to each other and sort things out; in some cases they’ll talk to us, but because we’re segmenting them, the conversations that you and we have will all be about that sort of case, and we’ll deal with all the issues for that sort of case, before we move on to the next sort of case. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Yes, there will be a volume, but we are doing it over three years so we’re spreading it out.

This is a slightly anecdotal reflection, but my sense is that our perception of all public services as MPs is coloured by the fact that it is all the horrible cases that go wrong that come to see us. The CSA deals with a million families and only a tiny number ever go and see their MP, but when they do, it’s a real mess. A lot of families get a decent service from the Child Support Agency; we just never hear about it because they never tell us. But I entirely accept there will be difficult cases. I don’t think we should say to our constituents, “All this should be done within 13 days” or whatever. We will have those sorts of targets, but by the time they get to us, it’s a different issue.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q66</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Glenda Jackson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> On the issue of the new pathfinder system, how many historical cases are included in that or are they all new?

The July start date for the families with two children was bang on time. The November one we have just done was a month late, there or thereabouts.

Secondly, you are assuming a degree of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">proactivity</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, and while, for families with time and without all sorts of problems, that is all wonderful, many families have multiple problems and the time to put their hands up just is not there.

If you think about it, if you spend three months doing an assessment and no maintenance is paid in the meantime, you are immediately three months in arrears. If we can sort the assessment out in 10 or 12 days, or whatever, we are on the front foot already. Because we are dealing with a smaller volume of cases where we actually need to get involved, we can monitor those much more actively, rather than having a million just sitting on the books.  On arrears and compliance, we publish figures for how many are getting any money and how many are paying everything; we don’t say, “That’s fine. A bit of money once a quarter, that’s all right—job done.” But what we do know is that we have a much better prospect of building on this in the cases where at least some maintenance is flowing. There is a different category of people where absolutely nothing is being paid, so we are absolutely not satisfied if people just pay a bit now and again. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Susan Park:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> It is one of the reasons why, in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">s</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">tatistical summary that we produce, we started looking at what is owed in a year and what we get in a year.

If they say, “No, I can’t sort this out for myself; I want to use your service”, they pay the £20 fee, unless there is domestic violence or abuse. We will do a calculation to work out how much maintenance would be payable. Ideally, that information is available then, so the parent with care can say to the paying parent, “The child maintenance people have done the sums. It’s £100 a month. You can either pay it to me directly, or we do it the hard way, in which case you don’t just pay me the £100; you pay them £20 on top.” That is the conversation we want to have if we get to that point.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Clearly, if the paying parent says, “No, I’m not interested,” we will go through the statutory scheme, and then there is a 4% charge on the parent with care and a 20% penalty. Our view is that that is not the end of the matter. We do not then walk away and say, “Right, there’s nothing more that can be done with that case.” The whole point about the 20% every month is the reminder, the jog: “Look, we don’t really need to be involved with this. You know what the figures are.”</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">If enforcement is involved—a deduction from earnings order or something—we will charge the non-resident parent for that as well, so there is this push all the time. What we do not want is people to be simply stuck there as a permanent state. Relationships change. There might be a point where it is very difficult and this is where they end up, but over time things change, so what we are trying to do is constantly prod to get people back out, and we need the charge on both sides, because otherwise the one parent has absolutely no reason, even if things change, to ever go outside the statutory scheme.

Okay, thank you. The previous report from the Committee recommended that in circumstances in which a parent with care has taken all reasonable steps to collaborate with the non-resident parent to create a family-based arrangement but no such arrangement has proved possible, application and collection charges should fall only on the non-resident parent.

That strikes me as being unfair. Why did the DWP decide to go down the road where both parents would be charged, even in the case of those people who are trying to do their best? It seems an anomaly. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Steve Webb:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I understand the perceived unfairness. There are two points I would make. First of all, no charges apply in the case of domestic violence or abuse. The £20 is gone. There is still the 4%. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">When you made your recommendation we were envisaging a 2:1 ratio between the charges—20% for the paying parent, and then 7% to 12%. We are now on a 5:1 ratio, so the balance has been shifted dramatically: five-sixths of the charges will come from the paying parent. The question would be this: if we got rid of the 4% for cases such as you describe, first of all we would have to identify them—we would have to identify the good guys, as it were, and have a test to see whether the parent with care was doing everything they could reasonably have done. You can imagine the disputes we would have about that: what is enough? What would be the test? It is easy to think that there is a bad guy and a good guy in this, but actually human relationships are obviously much more complicated than that. We as an agency would have to be able to say, “You are completely compliant, and we will waive the 4% because you have done everything you can possibly do.” In some cases it would be obvious but in many cases it would not be, and then we would be having appeals, disputes and all the rest of it. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Our strategy is to say, “Look, 96p in the pound is going to the parent with care.” That is the point: the 96p in the pound. The 4% is just that nudge—it is not 12% or 20%—to show that if things start getting better and maintenance starts flowing reliably we want both parents to have an incentive to move to direct pay, where no charges apply. That is the important point: even if we are overseeing it, if it is direct pay the charges stop. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q97</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Stephen Lloyd:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I can see that there has obviously been some adjustment from the DWP on the back of our report so that it is loaded more towards the non-paying parent. I understand how difficult it would be to apportion complete blamelessness to a particular individual, particularly given the systemised process you are going to have. I would just flag the fact that even though there has been a real, positive change in how much more is loaded on to the non-paying parent, there will be a tremendous sense of injustice among those individuals—and we have come across them—who clearly have done everything right but are still not getting anything. Although I understand the logic, the Department needs to understand that there will be that sense of real injustice. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Steve Webb:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I will bring Susan in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">in</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> a second.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">All I will say is that some of those cases will be cases where no maintenance at all was flowing, and because we are able to focus on the more difficult cases, to take HMRC data and all the rest of it, we will have got maintenance flowing.

So out of those 1 million-odd cases that we close, those will be the last ones, so we will have worked out how to deal with the transition; we will have got all our structures in place. That means that those cases will go on running for a couple more years, probably. Some of them will just flow out, because the kids reach 16, or whatever it is. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What we will then do is have what we call a compliance opportunity—as you mentioned, a six-month-or-so period before the case closes, where, in this sort of case, typically, arrears are involved. One thing we would do is say, “Right, the deduction from earnings order will be for the regular maintenance and then the non-resident parent will have the voluntary payment of arrears.” That might sound a bit odd, but what we are saying there is they have six months or so to prove that, when we let them do something voluntarily, they actually do it reliably month after month: a standing order, a monthly debit card payment, or whatever it is. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Only if they satisfy us that they are now reasonably likely to pay on a regular basis would we then close them down and start the whole thing off from scratch, if the other parent wants them to. If they mess us around in that six-month window, we simply move them straight to a deduction of earnings order in the new system. We can’t just do that directly. We can’t just move them straight across because of the 20% charge. We can’t just say to somebody who is now paying regularly, “We are just going to jack your maintenance up by 20% because we don’t trust you.” We have got to give them that window, but we do the window before we shut the case. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">For example, one idea we have had is to ask for post-dated cheques. If somebody owes some money and we are letting them pay voluntarily, we might take a credit card imprint like you do when you hire a car at an airport or something, so that if they then mess us about, not only do we know they are going to mess us about and move them on to the new system straight away; we also take the money, because we have got their credit card details, or whatever. It is not perfect, but we have tried our best to make sure that people who are still going to mess us around go straight across to the new system.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q113</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Kwasi</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Kwarteng</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The soft Gateway that you introduced in 2013: what have you actually learned from that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Susan Park:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> One of the important lessons we have learned is, if you have the right conversation with people, you can actually get a different outcome; so a lot of the people who would have automatically defaulted into the state service were actually very willing to have a conversation with somebody who was willing to talk them through what their other options are.

We are still in the very early days—do not forget that we have only just started to take all applications. Of the cohort that started a year ago, not all of them will have got to a missed payment, but, as I said, we are tracking each case at the moment to see what happens. So if the system indicates that there is no payment, the system shoves up an alert and then the caseworker takes action. That is an automated process that does not exist in the existing CSA systems. Is it working? The system is alerting us, so yes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q117</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dame Angela Watkinson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> If there are no funds with the paying parent, is it just registered as an arrear?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Susan Park:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So we do lots of things to establish whether there are funds. One thing, as I think either Ian or the Minister said, is that we have a direct interface into the credit reference agents, so we can see what activity there is. We also have access to bank accounts, so, again, if we have evidence of money being held in a bank account, we can go to that. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Our arrears strategy set out some of the trials we are looking at. We have worked with some organisations to look at taking clients who are willing to go through this a process that shows their income and their outgoings and having a reasoned conversation on the basis of that factual information. So we are constantly working at: is there money there and, if there is, can we get it? If there is not money there—or assets or homes or whatever—are there other ways that we can take these people on a journey to be compliant?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q118</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dame Angela Watkinson:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Okay.

I am quite sympathetic to the basic idea, which would be if somebody is not paying their maintenance who ought to be, and they realise that missing their maintenance is an adverse credit event that we would tell credit reference agencies about and therefore in the future they might not be able to get a mortgage, a car loan or whatever, it might be another lever we could use to encourage payment. We are trying not to do everything at once. We are focusing on delivering the 2012 system, but this looks to us like a potentially fruitful enforcement mechanism, so we are certainly looking at it seriously.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q119</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> There has been a lot of concern about the prioritisation of the collection of the different arrears groups, because, obviously, the strategy document makes clear that you are going to try to stop new arrears building up. However, the people who have been most ill-served by the old system are somehow going to be at the end of the line or the bottom of the heap depending on the analogy you want to use. Why have you adopted that approach?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Steve Webb:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Everybody can’t be a priority. In a sense, everybody ought to get their child maintenance arrears and we are not ignoring anybody. That is the first thing to say. We clearly want to get this money, but if you have an option between stopping arrears starting then, in my view, that absolutely has to be the first thing we do. I liken it to the wall on the estate that has the first piece of graffiti, and if we do not deal with it, suddenly, it is everywhere. If we establish the right patterns of behaviour at the start, that is obviously the first priority; to tackle it at source.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The second question is: are there, for want of a better phrase, children with mouths to feed now? It seems to us that these are pretty brutal choices that we have to make. Yes, if we had lots of resources we could do everything all at once and everyone is a priority, but we don’t, so the next priority is children who have live maintenance entitlements to make sure that the people are still children. Where the children are grown up but there is still an outstanding maintenance liability, we are still going to go for those arrears; but inevitably, that is more about the past than about current living standards.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q120</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So in operational terms, if you have been giving that low priority, what does it mean—that there is not really going to be any money spent on it and these folk can kiss goodbye to getting any money?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Steve Webb:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> No, but it would be dishonest of me to say that organisations don’t prioritise things.

To the extent that we have the resources to then pursue that third group, we will do that, but I cannot say that everybody is a priority.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Susan Park:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> No, and we did set out that we are trying to do some trials to test different ways—so, with some arrears-only cases, simple things like changing a communication, a letter, how we actually ask for information. We are trialling that. We are doing some trials to inform what else might we do in this particularly difficult area.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q121</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> And are you going to be honest with people to actually let them know that they are now low priority?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Susan Park:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes, and again that is one of the trials. The Australians do just that. They look at whether they have enough information and whether they have got any assets and they actually make it clear, both in the way they report the arrears and in the way that they inform both the mother and father. That is exactly one of the trials that we are looking at. Can we take a group of people, where we think we have done everything possible—including data washing the information through HMRC, going to the Land Registry and looking at banks—and we have come to the end and we have got zero. So taking those cases and a cohort of them, and then having an honest conversation with both parents but mainly the parent with care in this set of circumstances—unless anything changes, unless we get any new information—we have come to the end of the road and there is nothing more that we can do.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The difference that we have over the Australian system is that we keep washing that information through HMRC and Land Registry information. So we do not leave it completely alone; we actually continually data wash it. If anything pops up then we have a different conversation.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q122</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> But a lot of these people might be self-employed—we have already discussed how difficult that is. There is a generation of non-resident parents who are the worst for compliance and have got away with it for years. I suspect it is the parents with care who come to all of our constituency offices, frustrated that all these years have gone by and they have not got any money from their ex-partner. Are you saying, through the approach you are taking, that in reality that generation are not going to be tracked down?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Steve Webb:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> No. It is very important that we do not send out the wrong message here. We are not letting people off the hook—the arrears stay there and should be paid. That is point 1. Point 2 is that we are not contrasting with a world where currently we are doing vast amounts of incredibly vigorous arrears gathering for these people, because if we were, they would not be the people you are talking about. It is not like we are going to move from vigour to apathy. We are saying that these are some of the very hardest cases. The kids have now grown up, so it is historic debt.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I would like to mention that we now have legal powers for a partial settlement of the full arrears. Another option that we are starting to look at is to say, “Look, Ian and his colleagues have agreed that it is £10,000, and given that we have had no joy getting any of that, is there a possibility that they could just settle for x thousand?” The parent with care says, “Well, it is not everything I am owed, but it puts that chapter behind me. I can get on with my life, and I’ve got some money.” We are then not wasting money chasing people who are not going to pay. That is a new strategy that we can look at.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Q123</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Teresa Pearce:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I was going to ask about the Australian model, but you have sort of mentioned it.

Of that £3.8 billion, more than £1 billion is owed to the Secretary of State; it is not owed to parents with care.

One final question about when people have to approach the Department.
