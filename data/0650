At a time when trust is low, expecting people to say they trust anyone to tell them the truth, without more reassurance, is asking a lot. I'm also not a fan of the way the trust question came after questions about exaggeration of climate change and agreement among scientists.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal">14.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic"> “Add to this Mori's trust index, which finds scientists are among the most trusted groups, and that trust in them has gone up over the last decade.

Polling suggests scientists are the group the public trusts most to give information about climate change. In terms of increasing public understanding of the issue and engagement with it, this suggests there is an opportunity for scientists to contribute to informing discussion about the issue. In our view scientists should establish themselves as voices in the debates around climate change that take place in the media and politics. There are a range of views on how they should do so, reflected in the active academic debate around how scientists should inform policymaking and the public.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">16. The committee asks: "How could public understanding of what is meant by climate change be improved? What are the main barriers to this?

To focus on media coverage of climate change: In our view it is very likely that how the media covers climate change informs public views and understanding about climate change. The media help shape </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">how climate change is discussed</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> by the public and politicians, and </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">media coverage also</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> reflect</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">s</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> how the issue is discussed - particularly in the political sphere.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">18. There are many examples of media coverage of climate change that does a good job of reflecting and explaining scientific debates around the issue. At its best, such coverage can info</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">rm the public and policymakers </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">and equip them to engage with questions about climate and energy policy. To take one recent example</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">,</span><a name="_ftnref14"></a><a href="#_ftn14">[14]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> ITV addressed the UK’s cold winter in a series of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">segments that</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> presented a range of scientific views on the degree to which climate change is affecting UK weather. The report</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">s</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> gave a picture of the issue, presented the views of different scientists, and reflected scientific uncertainty about the question.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">19. On a larger scale, the BBC’s Frozen Planet series provided a good example of entertaining and informative science programming. Climate change is leading to significant changes at the poles, and the series illustrated the long-term effects of warming rather than engaging in complex scientific questions. Extra and more detailed information was also made available through resource packs and via scientific institutions the British Antarctic Survey and the Open University. The programme may have increased interest in and understanding of this issue.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">20. However, our experience suggests that some media coverage of climate change and climate science in particular is confused or misleading, and does not do a good job of representing scientific understanding or scientific debates accurately. In particular, scientific uncertainty can be over-stressed to cast doubt on areas of climate science where there is broad scientific agreement. This may lead to confusion and disengagement in the public.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">21. To some degree coverage of climate change in the media has become politicised. The Reuters Institute at Oxford University recently produced a report, 'Poles Apart',</span><a name="_ftnref15"></a><a href="#_ftn15">[15]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> which suggests 'right-leaning' media outlets are more likely to print uncontested climate sceptic views - reflecting a small minority of scientific opinion. The report suggests this aspect of climate change coverage is most prominent in the "Anglophone countries" - the UK, Australia and the US. It found "a strong correspondence between the perspective of a newspaper and the prevalence of sceptical voices within it, particularly on the opinion pages." Politicisation of the issue in the media may reflect the politicisation of climate politics in these countries.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">22. The BBC is probably the most influential media outlet in the UK. The organisation’s editorial convention of promoting balance - favouring neither one view or another - has been </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">suggested</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">proving challenging when</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">covering scientific areas where there is broad agreement</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. The BBC Trust’s 2011 review of science coverage by Professor Steven Jones</span><a name="_ftnref16"></a><a href="#_ftn16">[16]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> highlighted that in scientific areas such as climate</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> change,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> genetic modification</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> or MMR which become controversial for whatever reason</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, this convention can have the effect of suggesting there is an even-sided debate between proponents and dissenters, when in fact there is significant agreement between scientists.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">23. The BBC issued a report last November</span><a name="_ftnref17"></a><a href="#_ftn17">[17]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> expressing satisfaction that the corporation has made progress in portraying where the weight of opinion on scientific topics lies. But we have seen </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">prominent</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> examples of programmes in which the BBC</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> has framed climate change as a</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> debate between ‘sceptics’ and 'believers'. These include an episode of the Daily Politics in June 2012</span><a name="_ftnref18"></a><a href="#_ftn18">[18]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> in which climate sceptic blogger James Delingpole debated with Friends of the Earth’s Andrew Pendleton about whether an apparent slowdown in global surface temperature rise meant global warming had 'stopped'. It is a subject that, arguably, neither party is qualified to discuss. Instead of investigating the scientific arguments about the subject, the report reinforced the idea that climate change is a political argument, not a subject on which scientists agree. Similar discussions were also found on Radio 5’s Your Call, the Today programme and Newsnight.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">24. We focus on the BBC due to its influence on public opinion - it is also more trusted by the public than other media. But there are many other examples of coverage that creates a confusing picture of climate science and also conflates relatively detailed issues of uncertainty in climate science with broad arguments about climate policy. The Daily Mail has recently published a series of articles under headlines claiming that global warming had 'stopped', which went on to attack government policies to reduce emissions</span><a name="_ftnref19"></a><a href="#_ftn19">[19]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. Most recently Channel 4 news ran a segment that nominally aimed to address whether climate change caused the UK’s recent cold weather, but the discussion soon turned to whether scientists can account for the apparent slowing in global temperatures and then to whether climate policies are justified. Rapid jumps between detailed scientific specifics, broad scientific conclusions and pundits or politicians arguing about climate policy are unlikely to increase understanding in audiences.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="h.ran6vh5l54cr"></a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">25.

Although useful to indicate broad trends, polling about belief in climate change is unlikely to give a full picture of public understanding of climate change, and the complex question of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">how people’s understanding of the issue interacts with support for</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> climate policies. Our polling, for example, found a significant proportion of those who say they don’t believe in human-caused climate change still say they want the government to invest in ‘green’ policies.
