Ripon had noticeably declined in prosperity in the intervening years and continues to do so. The purpose of the campaign was to reduce traffic on the A61 Ripon-Harrogate roa</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">d in the peaks and provide a better public transport hub for Ripon and surrounding hinterland. Outside peak hours at that time there was an hourly bus to Harrogate throughout the day with last buses finishing about 10.00pm. North of Ripon, the local bus se</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">rvice was almost non-existent (as it still is to-day) with only three buses a day to Thirsk. Barbara Castle stated in 1966 that there would be a replacement express bus to Thirsk and Northallerton railway stations as a condition of approving closure in 196</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">7. This service lasted less than two years. This was not adequate for the 900 students at Ripon Teacher Training College for evenings out or for travelling home at weekends mid term. The whole College supported the campaign to restore a railway service. Re</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">instatement didn’t come fast enough as student numbers dwindled to the point where College was not sustainable and closed in 2002 after 140 years as a higher educational establishment. Ripon lost £4m contribution annually to the local economy from students</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> and lecture staff. Beeching had a far greater impact on the prosperity of Ripon than just losing a rail service. The Principal blamed closure on the closure of the railway as students had cited poor transport communications preferring to attend the twinne</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">d College of York St John. Decline will continue as the Ministry of Defence announced earlier this year closure of Ripon Army Barracks with the loss of local civilian jobs and the loss of 1,800</span><span style="color:#1f497d; font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">military incomes to the local economy. If ever railway reinsta</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">tement is needed to boost the economy here in Ripon, now is the time. Closure is to save £200m</span><span style="color:#1f497d; font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">of Defence budget annually.

This level of service is only sustained by the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">large number of bus pass journeys. Without bus pass concessions (530,000 journeys between Ripon and Harrogate in 2011) this frequency would be unsustainable so indirectly is heavily subsidised. Eight buses an hour passing through the narrow, congested city</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> centre streets is now becoming a problem with air quality and cause for concern of environmentalists and the City Council. North of Ripon only five buses a day between the hours of 7.30am and 5.30pm Sundays, Bank Holidays excepted and four daily during sc</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">hool holidays.
