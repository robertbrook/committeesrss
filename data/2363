This is a measure we support. The legal sector in the UK is estimated to have an annual turnover of over £25 billion and is an employer of 320,000 people. Yet its regulatory framework is complex and burdensome and ill-suited to adjust to rapidly changing economic circumstances.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Requiring </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; text-decoration:underline"> all</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> current and future regulators active in the legal services sector to have due regard to the desirability of promoting economic growth would be important context for them to bear in mind as they deliver their statutory objectives.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The response of Government to consultation on this aspect of the Bill suggested, however, that the duty would only be applied to two of the regulators active in the legal sector, the LSB and the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA). This, in our view, would be a unfortunate outcome for legal services businesses  and their consumers. We have therefore written to the Better Regulation Delivery Office to stress the need for broader application of the duty (annex 1). Should this aspect form part of the Committee's  future discussions we would be happy to provide additional information.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Chris Kenny</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Chief Executive</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">13 September 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">A</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">nnex 1</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Graham Russell</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Chief Executive</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Better Regulation Delivery Office</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Lower Ground Floor</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Victoria Square House </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Victoria Square </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Birmingham </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">B2 4AJ </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">4 September 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Dear Mr Russell,</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Re: non-economic regulators: duty to have regard to growth</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The Legal Services Board (LSB) has read with interest the Government's  response to consultation published in early July.  We have noted in particular your referencing the LSB's support in principle for the idea of a growth duty being applied to regulators in the legal sector.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">We are pleased to have been able to support his initiative however I feel it is necessary  to take this opportunity to reiterate and reemphasise some of the detail of what we said in response to the consultation itself (see our 18 April 2013 submission to the consultation).</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">In particular I'd like to underline and highlight the caveat that was included with that support.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Our view, as stated already, is that in order to make a growth duty work in the legal sector, the LSB and all approved regulators should be subject to it.  In addition to the LSB and the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) there are eight other regulators active in the legal sector and further new approved regulators may be designated in future.  It is our view that all nine approved regulators plus the LSB should be included under the remit of the growth duty proposals  as opposed to merely the LSB and SRA as implied by Annex A of the consultation response document. This would appear to be in line with your broader intention as stated at 6.9 of the consultation response ie that the measure should apply to all bodies that have had regulatory functions conferred on them by Parliament. All approved regulators in the legal sector derive their regulatory functions from the Legal Services Act 2007.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Otherwise I believe it will be impossible to enforce if it applies to some regulators and not others.  It will also be inconsistent with the better regulation principle as it will neither be targeted nor consistent. Indeed, failure to apply the growth duty to all regulators will see the legal services regulatory objective</span><a name="_ftnref1"></a><a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> of promoting competition being undermined as it can be plausibly argued that it needs to be applied to those not subject in a different way to its application to the LSB and the SRA.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">This also speaks to the broader point made in our original submission: this measure can be made to work most effectively in the legal sector by amending the Legal Services Act 2007, rather than introducing the duty as a separate provision in stand-alone legislation.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The second point I would like to reiterate is that it remains necessary to make clear what "growth" means in the context of the legal sector as well as how that duty might be balanced against the various regulators other statutory duties.  As already alluded to legal regulators have eight specific duties which are equally ranked in terms of priority. Promoting one statutory duty above all others for only two of the many legal regulators will lead to bureaucratic and regulatory tensions in the legal sector.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The final point I'd like to reiterate is that it is essential that a growth duty does not prevent regulators taking action against individuals or businesses that have contravened their rules </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">and which may need to be closed down.  Neither must the duty mean that regulators cannot prevent undesirable individuals or businesses entering the market in the first place.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">I feel that it is necessary to write to you like this to restate our support for this initiative.
