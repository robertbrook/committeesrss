In a few cases I set targets. I only did this with the support and indeed encouragement of my Chief Constable. I am, however, considering reducing specific performance measures included in the Plan but adopting appropriate measures to be assessed against detailed delivery plans. This will enable them to be more readily adjusted and revised outside of the formal plan variation process.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 54pt; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal">•</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">How do you assure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct?

Both I and my deputy attend regular Force Performance Group meetings where performance is discussed in detail. In addition I am aware of the robust systems the Chief Constable has put in place to ensure the integrity of the figures. To assist you I enclose a recent report from Superintendent Sue Thomas in this regard. Thirdly I am reassured by the external oversight provided by HMIC.
