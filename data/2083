The owner bought the land in the knowledge that there was no right of way, and that it had the protection of the owner’s declaration that there was no intention to dedicate a right of way. However, after the change of ownership a claim was made for a right of way. Because there is no time limit in place within which a claim must be made, the claimants were able to leapfrog the previous fourteen years and make a claim based on alleged use dating back to the 1970’s. As landowners are able to allow permissive access once a section 31(6) declaration is in place, there is considerable confusion within the user evidence about the use that took place within the most recent fourteen year period (and which therefore cannot give rise to a right of way), and that which is alleged to have taken place prior to that.

A claim was made to upgrade the footpath to a bridleway. The procedures for making a modification order were shown not to have been properly followed by the authority. Despite this, the order process continued. The owner relied on the placing of signs and a section 31(6) declaration to show that the use claimed could not have taken place “as of right” within the twenty year period to 2006. The authority then simply leapfrogged the statutory declaration and signs to claim an earlier twenty year period, this time ending in 1998. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The owner says: “A declaration is useless as authorities will simply leapfrog it until they reach a period of time it wasn’t in place.
