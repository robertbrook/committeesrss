The first report can best be described as mainly a work of fiction because the daily   ward routine described, where a doctor visited the ward each day was not being followed during the period in question. This was because the ward doctor was on annual leave.

On the subject of my many requests to see a doctor, it is implied that because none were recorded in the patient’s notes I made no request, thereby suggesting that the records were sacrosanct. There was an apology for the poor quality of their records. In the letter from the Trust’s Risk Manager, of 13.10.08 it is recorded that Dr      said he “also apologises for the apparent unavailability of his medical team in his absence, although I do suspect that the medical team were not aware of your request to see them.”   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">3. The all important urine sample could and should have been taken for testing on the night my wife was admitted to hospital and the statement “Once at the Lister a catheter specimen of urine was sent for culture” implies that it was taken promptly after admission, whereas the records show that the sample was not available to be collected for the path lab before the 18.02.08, four days after my wife was admitted to the ward. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">4.
