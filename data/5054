In some areas, PCCs’ offices and PCCs themselves have expressed concern </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">that Panels are seeking to focus on operational issues, or seeking information about operational matters. However, there is no easy distinction between the two concepts. In order to understand whether the PCC has succeeded in fulfilling his </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">or her </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">objectives under the Police and Crime Plan, and to assess whether previous budgets have been value for money (in terms of outcomes) there will need to be some consideration of operational outcomes. </span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">25.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Disagreements about the meaning of words in the Act – which coalesce around the two points above – serve to </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">perpetuate tortuous, circular and legalistic arguments and what information the PCP is “entitled” to see, and actions it is “entitled” to carry out. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">26.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">These disagreements highlight a more fundamental issue – a lack of understanding </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">about the role and remit of the Panel</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> by PCCs, their offices and, in some instances, Panels themselves</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">A large number of Panel members are former police authority members, and some of them do not appreciate how their role has changed since November 2012, and that the Panel is not the police authority’s “replacement”. Equally, some PCCs, and their offices, are resistant to the idea of scrutiny by an external body,</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">resulting in an approach that has seen little information being shared and little willingness to engage to explore how the relationship might work better in the future. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Where little information is shared between the PCC and the Panel, it makes the work of the Panel more difficult to carry out, which raises questions locally about the Panel’s effectiveness. This is a vicious cycle that need to be broken to make the arrangements work, but is not by any means a systemic problem affecting all Panels. Indeed, in many areas these problems have either been overcome, or never occurred in the first place. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; text-decoration:underline">Holding to account: resourcing</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">27.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Each Panel has £53,000 of funding from the Home Office to support its Police and Crime Panel. We understand that this was calculated to reflect the average funding required, with on-costs, to appoint a scrutiny officer (a post roughly equivalent to that of a committee specialist on a Commons select committee). </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">28.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Notwithstanding this funding, resourcing has proven to be a challenge for many (but not all) Panels. The Home Office assumed that Panels would need to meet only four times a year; over the course of 2012 and 2013, most have met at least seven times and a few as many </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">as </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">twelve. This has in part been due to </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">a disproportionate number of confirmation hearings in year 1, but also reflects the need for Panels to cover a wide range of issues, and to undertake a workload that allows them to fully engage with PCCs’ work. The consensus amongst Panels is that four meetings per year would not allow them to do this. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">29.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Where they exist, resource challenges are exacerbated by the fact that the range of skills required to support Panels are wide-ranging, and unlikely to be possessed by a single person. They include legal, finance, HR, policy and research, administrative support and specialist knowledge of community safety issues. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">This has resulted in expertise being brought in by lead authorities in an ad hoc manner, which has resulted in a number of lead authorities informally expending more than the £53,000 allocated by the Home Office, to ensure that Panels run effectively.

It has been suggested to us that Panels could have a formal role in scrutinising proposals to suspend or dismiss Chief Constables. This is an issue that has arisen in a couple of Forces. Initially it seems to be an attractive idea, but work would need to be done to establish precisely what the Panel’s role would be in such a decision. Another suggestion has been that Panels should be able to refer a Commissioner’s decision on his or her precept or Police and Crime Plan to the </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Home </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Secretary, as a way, in part, to bolster existing powers of veto. Again, </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">this is a power which would have to be considered in the context of the PCC’s directly elected role, the ability and legitimacy of the Home Secretary to adjudicate on such matters, and what this would mean more generally for the PCC’s powers to make decisions.

We think that more could be done to require PCCs to publish a wider variety of information as a matter of course – in particular, information relating to decision-making, which is at the moment inconsistent and incomplete in many areas;</span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 46.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Changing Panels more fundamentally. The Police Commission tasked by the Labour Party to carry out a review of policing in England and Wales suggest the establishment of Force-level strategic boards, made up of council leaders, to hold chief constables to account. Such boards would have wide powers to make decisions and direct budgets (as they would be likely to act as de facto </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Community Safety Partnership for a whole Force area). As such it would be necessary to have a separate body to hold them to account, or to empower local government overview and scrutiny with the powers and resources to do so. </span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">33.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Possibilities which would not include legal changes might include:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 46.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Clearer guidance from the Home Office </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">about the fundamental role and remit of the Panel and how it relates to the PCC, placing the statutory duties of the Panel in some strategic context;</span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 46.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">More use of the powers available to authorities to pool budgets to provide additional financial support to Panels.
