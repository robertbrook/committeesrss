That this is analogous to a Conditional Fee arrangement.  However, in such cases, if the claim fails solicitors and barristers are not paid. Whereas if the case succeeds solicitors and barristers receive a substantial uplift on their usua</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">l hourly rates, meaning that the risk is financially justified by the prospect of obtaining a very high hourly rate if the case is successful.  For this proposal to work in any way which would mean lawyers would take the risk of applying for permission and</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> not getting paid for it (given the substantial work involved simply in drafting JR Grounds and lodging bundles etc) then lawyers must expect to get paid, by the Legal Aid Fund, their private hourly rates + an uplift of 100%, for their work applying for JR</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt"> Permission.  As enhancements apply in any event to legal aid rates, such that lawyers factor in these enhancements in business planning, to cover the additional risk of this particular conditional fee the enhancements would not be sufficient.  It is likel</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">y that paying such uplifts (without which this proposal is utterly unworkable since lawyers will not be able to afford to take the risk of applying for JR permission) will cost the State more than simply trusting that lawyers at present diligently assess p</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">rospects, that the LAA considers prospects in addition to this in any event, and that therefore the system should remain as it is and funding should continue for applications for permission notwithstanding that, for whatever reason, they may fail.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">6.
