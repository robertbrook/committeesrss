Fundamental to public confidence, and therefore growth, is that the regulator is, and is seen to be, wholly independent, impartial and objective. While we do not believe the current wording of the draft legislation should impair our objectivity, there is a risk that the concept of the desirability of economic growth becomes confused or </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">conflated with the promotion of the commercial interests of specific economic sectors. If it appears to the public that it is any part of the Commission’s role to promote the industry - as opposed to permitting the industry to promote itself and grow so far as is compatible with consumer protection, the likely outcome is a reduction in public confidence and a consequent reduction in the public acceptance of gambling as a main stream leisure </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">acitivity</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">.

But the reform measure designed to reduce burdens on industry and foster economic growth may have the unintended consequence of regulator and parts of industry expending time and money on unproductive and costly delaying tactics if the guidance does not encourage speedy and transparent decision making with the least possible procedural overhead.
