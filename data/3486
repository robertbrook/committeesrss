Indeed the use of phage to control a variety of bacterial pathogens, including those responsible for dysentery and cholera, became well established in the 1920s and 1930s. However a poor understanding of phage molecular biology, coupled to an unscrupulous attitude within some major drugs companies at the time, meant that phage cocktails were sold as “cure- alls”. For example cocktails could be purchased for the treatment of polio and influenza, both of which are caused by viruses rather than bacteria. Cynicism grew amongst the general public and the scientific community throughout the 1930s and 1940s. The discovery and subsequent widespread availability of antibiotics consigned phage therapy to a medical backwater, at least in The West. Continued use of phages as therapeutic agents survived only behind the Iron Curtain. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-18pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">1.4</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Today Georgia and Poland are the only two countries where phages are routinely offered as treatment for infectious disease.

They perceive that the risk/reward profile in infectious disease drug development will remain askew for the foreseeable future, at least for businesses that are at pre phase II clinical trial data generation. And yet to get to that stage remains a tall order on business angel funding alone. We know from our contacts in Poland that there are anti-MRSA phage cocktails that have been developed in the laboratory and used on people with no adverse outcomes.
