In fact, conditions on the ground have not markedly improved for many communities in ceasefire areas, and there are increasing problems with land grabs, displacement, and business deals being reached between the government and ethnic insurgent leaders.  This is an important issue for DFID and the UK government.  DFID should use its influence to encourage an approach to peace that goes beyond the elites on all sides, and involves close community involvement and consultation. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">5</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">.2      It is important that DFID should promote the rights of women in the context of the various peace processes underway.
