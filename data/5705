As you will appreciate, most of us here do not have a background in this area of work. Don’t feel you will be insulting us by telling us very basic things. We would much rather be told very basic things twice than have them skimmed over. Given the fact that land reform in Scotland has traditionally focused on rural rather than urban land—we are interested in both of those—and the distortions caused by the tax system, does it make sense for us to make, however, a substantial differentiation between the way in which urban land markets and rural land markets work, or is there a substantial degree of overlap?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Adams</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There is a substantial degree of overlap if you look at markets in a particular way, which places great emphasis on the behaviour and strategies of the owner. It looks at the relationship between the strategies and key players, such as estate agents, so there are ways in which you look at land markets that can be as applicable in urban and rural areas.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Having said that, the issues are rather different. In urban areas, certainly in key settlements in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> such as </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Glasgow</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, there is a huge overhang of land that is not being used. It has been vacant and derelict for a long period of time. In rural areas, such land is very rare in terms of unused land on the Scottish Government’s vacant and derelict land register, for example, and the issues are much more about ownership structures and the extent to which, as a result of those ownership structures, the land is being used to sustainable effect or not.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Cheshire</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I would come at it from a rather different view. My basic message to you would be that all the work that I have done, and that an increasing number of scholars around the world have done, reinforces the conclusion that land markets are amazingly efficient at capitalising almost everything. By “capitalising,” I mean that the price of land reflects everything about its value and use, including intangible things like not just current aircraft noise but expected future aircraft noise. Some very interesting work is going on in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Berlin</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> at the moment. There is a proposal for a new airport, and the proposed flight paths and opening date have been changed over time. Each of those changes is already capitalised into the land markets in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Berlin</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. If you try to help poor farmers by giving them subsidies, it gets capitalised into the price of land. If you give inheritance tax reliefs to farmers to try to keep family farms going, it gets capitalised into the price of land and squeezes family farmers out. If you give subsidies to farmers, it gets capitalised in the price of rural land. If you give planning permission with particular obligations, the expected value of those obligations—because it is always in the future—is again reflected in the price of land. This seems remarkably efficient, given that we know there is a fair degree of apparent monopoly in land markets, but you still have trade and it is trade on the margin that really matters. In urban areas, because lots of houses are changing hands, the process may be rather quicker and complete than it is in rural areas where the volume of trades is rather less relative to the total stock of land.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q293 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Professor Adams, I presume you agree with that. It is always quite helpful for us to have witnesses disagreeing and fighting between themselves, because it then illustrates for us the areas perhaps we need to give further thought to. If either of you do not say anything about the other’s answer, we will assume that you agree 100%.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Adams</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I do not think you can assume that you can get two economists in a room to agree. I do not fully agree with what Professor Cheshire has to say. He comes at it from a different mode of economic analysis that has its strengths as well as its weaknesses. There are a number of issues in what he has to say. First, the difference between price and value needs to be much clearer. For example, one of the issues is the huge difficulties in ascertaining what the value is, those difficulties often being the result of not enough price evidence—in other words, not enough transactions.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In terms of the transactions in land and how the market works, we often find that a lot of the deals are done in a fairly closed way. Land is advertised to a very short list of people. It is not openly marketed; it is not an open competition; it is through contacts and networks. I would take what we call a much more institutional view of the land market than perhaps Professor Cheshire takes. For example, the big land agents in Scotland are very important in what one might call making the market and the way they lead people on, the way in which expectations are formed and the way in which behaviour is changed. You might put those two perspectives together because, if you take both of them, you might start to get towards the truth. I am not saying you should take one and ignore the other, but you should not necessarily expect that when you get two of us in a room we will agree.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 17.15pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:18.85pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> That is helpful.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Cheshire</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: As to the issue of price and value, it is yes and no. I do agree that there are some things which clearly have value which it is difficult to put prices on. What is the value of habitat, for example? What is the value of an SSSI? What is the value of something which reduces the chances of global warming? The problem is that you have these very long-term and uncertain outcomes and it is very difficult to value. In that sense, I am not disagreeing with my colleague. There are some things, but most of the things which actually happen, like the value of open space, the value of shooting rights, the value of fishing rights, the value of land for food production, the value of land as a licence to receive subsidies, or the value of land as a licence to receive exemption from inheritance tax, are pretty well priced in the market.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q294 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Professor Adams, I want you to clarify the distinction that you seem to be drawing between value and price. Without getting into metaphysics and the like, I just presumed that the only way in which you could measure the value of a piece of land, as with a piece of art, was the price somebody was prepared to pay for it. Am I missing a point here?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Adams</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: No. You are right, but then it depends on how much evidence you have of that. Let’s say you are valuing a semi-detached house. You would expect there to be a lot of comparable transactions you can draw on. If you are valuing a highland estate, for example, there will be very few relative transactions, and therefore the task of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">valuer</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> becomes much more difficult. Hypothetically, if you sent 10 </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">valuers</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> to do that exercise, the research shows that you would come up with 10 different answers. The question would be: how different are they? That depends on how particular is the form of property. If it is a semi-detached house, the differences might not be very much; if it is a highland estate, the differences between different </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">valuers</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> might be quite a lot.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Cheshire</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I am putting no trust in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">valuers</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> whatsoever, both from personal experience but also from academic studies of how reliable they are. All my evidence would be drawn from large-scale statistical studies of transactions, and that is where you can get really fine detail. It is not just a question of two semi-detached houses in the same road being rather similar, but you can identify statistically the implicit price of each attribute. Every property is different, but it is composed of a bundle of attributes. If you have got a large sample of transactions—a colleague at the LSE has just been analysing 1</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">million house transactions to identify the price that is put on green belt land—you can get very accurate statistical evidence, but I would never trust a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">valuer</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> to give me an accurate answer.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q295 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Professor Adams in particular, one of the difficulties we have with these hearings is that when you nod it is not recorded, so you have to say something. Let it be recorded that Professor Adams agreed with the idea that you should never trust a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">valuer</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Adams</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Professor Cheshire is right. If you have a large number of transactions in a particular form of property, the kind of econometric analysis that he specialises in becomes far easier. If you are undertaking that kind of analysis for, say, highland estates, it becomes much more difficult than it would be if you were doing it in an urban context for, say, semi-detached houses.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Cheshire</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: You can probably do it with a sample of 100 transactions, and over time you can get pretty good information. I have just done a study of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> office markets where I have identified 650 transactions, only 51 of which are interesting, and it is very clearly statistically identified.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q296 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Reid:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Following on from what you said earlier about everything, including tax and subsidies, affecting the value or price of land, are you able to tell us what distorting effects the taxation regime has on land in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Cheshire</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: As I understand it, the inheritance tax exemption of agricultural land applies in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> as it does in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">England</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.

Scottish Land and Estates, which, as you know, is the representative body for landowners in Scotland, told us previously in evidence: “Much is made of the fact that some individuals in Scotland own large landholdings, but large landholdings are equally as common in other countries, especially in countries where the productive value of the land is low.” Do you think it is fair to say that the productive value of Scottish land is low and that is why large landholdings are common?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Adams</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There is a whole series of historic and social reasons why we get large landholdings in Scotland. If we take just one example, Murray Estates goes back to 1563 and Mary Queen of Scots. There is an example of a large landholding that does all sorts of different things and is quite heavily involved in property development in new towns and so on and so forth. In those circumstances, there is a huge variety of different sorts of rural landowners in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, some of whom are more active and some of whom are more passive.

There is a broad statistical association between less productive land and larger holdings, which is what you would expect. My colleague may have a point in that there is a historical and institutional structure to it as well.

Allowing for the cost of land as part of the capital employed in agriculture, his conclusion was that the rate of return, if you looked at it in the long term, had not changed over about 200 years. It is very low. The reason is partly the psychic income where there appears to be a ready supply of people who are keen simply to own agricultural land to be farmers. That tends to push up the price of land at the margin, which means that, if you take account of the value of the land in the total cost of farming, it pushes down the return.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">If you look at the price of land since, say, 1930, you have periods of very substantial reduction.

That had an almost immediate effect on the price of land. It is the same with tax relief. Essentially, it is subsidy plus tax relief. That is why the price of land has been rising over time.

The more expensive land is, the more concentrated ownership tends to be and the more damaging agricultural practices will be to the environment. The argument that you need agricultural subsidies to safeguard the environment is the exact opposite of reality. What you need are conservation subsidies to preserve the environment. The cheaper the price of land, the easier it is for smaller people to enter the market, whether they are community groups or just smaller land owners.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q334 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Can I seek a view on the question of state aid rules?

If you stand back a little and think about the objectives of community ownership, they are quite different from the way in which land has been held in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> over a long period of time. That requires people to take risks. It requires communities to take risks because they have responsibilities as a result, but it also requires people within Government agencies to take risk, and perhaps push out the boat further than they would to make things happen and, if they do not break the rules, they certainly bend them. As well as looking in detail at the specifics of state aid, maybe it is just as important to look at the culture within the Government organisations that are responsible for interpreting those rules.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q335 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> That certainly echoes the sentiment we were expressing last week, or whenever we held our last session.

The aim is to identify what would be open market value for which the community has to stump up the cash. Coming back to what I was saying earlier, it is quite a difficult task for a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">valuer</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> to take maybe a small piece of land that the community wants to buy—perhaps it is part of a much larger estate—and say definitely what the open market value is. The tendency of the whole process is to give a more cautious and higher estimate of open market value than would probably be the case if you had a public auction of that single piece of land for the particular purpose that the particular community body wanted to buy it for. There is difficulty within the statutory process of trying to judge what open market value is for a product which there are very few transactions to compare against.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q336 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Presumably, if the Government announced tomorrow that the inheritance tax allowance and so on was being abolished, the valuations being arrived at would be much lower, almost a quarter.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Adams</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">valuers</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> could make an estimated adjustment.

You are talking about coming up with an open market value but in a market which effectively is dysfunctional, because it is massively affected by subsidies and hidden taxation. In terms of getting to a point where you are getting good value for the public purse, surely you have to deal with the market issues; otherwise, you deal with the bureaucracy of a community buying a piece of land and make that easier, but, at the end of the day, you are still left with a price, a valuation of the market, or otherwise, that is massively inflated by the system. Surely, from the point of view of getting proper value for money for what is effectively public money that you are handing over to buy this property, you should be dealing with the market, which is distorting the value of the property that you are then handing money over to buy.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Cheshire</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The market value of land is what they pay in the market.

At one stage, most of what we were paying farmers for environmental aspects was essentially for their forgone subsidy for not producing food. The problem is that we were paying out of two pockets at the same time. Take away the tax breaks and subsidies and convert the subsidies into conservation payments, which would have real community value but would also support farmers’ income, and the price of land will fall. If you did that, there would immediately be a lot of land coming on to the market because a lot of it is being held simply because it provides a way of shielding wealth against tax.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q338 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mike </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Crockart</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> To use your analogy, that is precisely what we are doing here.

That is the problem with the question, and probably why I hesitated over it. I cannot see any mileage in the long term in Governments wanting to intervene in the way you have said, but there are a number of things that Governments could do. For example, Governments have a role to play in ensuring much better information within the market. That may or may not have price implications. For example, the question of exactly who owns the land, what price has been paid and what the mortgages are is a contextual action that Governments can take that, in certain circumstances, may well result in price changes. This is quite separate from the debate on taxation, but I do not think that going in and saying, “We are going to subsidise land prices and try to get prices down that way,” is correct. The other way round—removing subsidies that may be keeping prices high—may well be appropriate.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q344 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Graeme </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Morrice</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Can I look at the options?

What Governments could perhaps do most productively is ensure that that land came to market. That does two things. First, it gets us away from all these estimates of value; it gives us real hard price evidence, and that probably means some write-down of owners’ expectations, because there are expectations of value in urban areas. Secondly, it also helps to produce new opportunities within urban areas. I have argued that strongly in urban areas.

You have to take the view that there comes a point where holding on to land without doing much about it is not in the public interest. Whether you define that as two, three, five or 10 years is an open question, but at that point there needs to be a procedure by which that land can be put to public auction. Whether it is public land or private land does not matter. Some of the land is held by public authorities. The majority of land is held by private bodies. We do not even know who holds some of it. If we put that land to public auction, we start to get a more realistic assessment of what prices probably are, reflecting today’s economic circumstances, and that is a stimulant to new activity.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q346 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Graeme </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Morrice</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> How do you bring about that situation?

I have published a paper on this. You would need to have a legislative procedure with all the safeguards you would suggest. These are what we call hard core vacant sites. It is not land that has been vacant for a year or two; it has been vacant through one boom and slump and the next boom, and nothing has happened. In many parts of urban Scotland, we need structural change. Part of that structural change is an acceptance that land values are not as they were and, in order to get that structural change, we need hard evidence through transactions. I think the best way to do that is a public procedure by which you can force that land to public auction.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q347 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Before Professor Cheshire comes in, can I clarify something?

If you have a piece of land that has been sitting idle for a number of years, a tax is imposed on it, and there are arguments for and against that. I think it is a fairly indirect mechanism. You can say that you tax land to raise the holding cost of keeping it vacant. It would take a long time for that to work through. A more direct mechanism is to have almost an inverse compulsory purchase order. It is not the state acquiring it but the state saying, after a period of time, “You’ve had your chance to make use of this land. You haven’t made use of it. This now has to go to auction and someone else can have it.”</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q348 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Surely, in those circumstances, you can quite easily have a carousel of owners.

There are holding costs which vary according to the type of land holder. Historically, one of the problems might have been with public authorities where there was no cost penalty to them and they simply were not behaving as if this was an asset which was potentially worth something. There may be some land tied up in that way, but privately held land has got a cost which is the opportunity cost of doing something with it. It may be that the owner expects the future value to be higher and there is an optional demand process going on. It may also be, in some former industrial areas, that the remediation costs of the land mean that it is not worth doing anything with it, unless you get quite substantial public assistance to remediate it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">When you come to rural land, it is very dangerous territory. What is land that is not having anything done with it? Is a nature reserve an area of land that is having nothing done with it? Is it a habitat that you are not wanting to develop in any way? I can certainly see an argument for a vacant land tax. Coming back to the tax relief that exists for agricultural land, I can see an argument for rateable values being applied to such land, certainly in England—I am not quite sure about the situation in Scotland—where agricultural land is exempt from local taxation. That seems an odd state of the world. I can see that you can’t charge a very high rateable value, but if there were some rateable value. Of course, on the margin you have things that are farmed. I know that in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Scotland</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> you have areas where maybe you could do some sort of very extensive farming but the land may be held by absentee landowners who are really doing nothing at all. Therefore, some nominal rate on vacant land, even rural vacant land, might be justifiable. That would get capitalised into the value of the agricultural land. If you were liable for paying those rates, the value of land would fall.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q349 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Professor Adams, can I pick up a point you made about not knowing who holds the land?

Compulsory purchase is uncertain legally and financially. There are a lot of constraints to put local authorities off going down that line, particularly with all the financial cutbacks.

These were areas of at least two hectares, so they were substantial sites. We did the study in the 1990s and looked at 80 in detail. Last year we went back. How many of those 80 had now been developed? Forty-three had been fully developed; 20 had been partially developed; and 17 were in exactly the same condition as they were in the mid-1990s. That exemplifies the issue that in many of these cities you have areas of vacant derelict land that has been in exactly the same condition for decades.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q363 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes, but is it not the case that there would almost be no economic use to which some of these derelict sites could be put?

This is very variable. A city which has got outward movement of population, for example, may have very substantial areas of land which essentially have no economic viability, unless there is major public intervention.

First, different potential users have different profit expectations. Those profit expectations turn into the way that they appraise potential schemes for development. When we are talking about whether particular pieces of land are viable we need to ask: viable for whom? They may not be viable for a large multinational company; they may be viable for a small local housing association, for example, because of the different ways the development appraisal is undertaken, the different profit ratios and so on. In some parts of urban Scotland, the answer is not multinational companies coming in; it is encouraging local enterprise, local community organisations, local co</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">operatives and local housing.

If the market were working as Professor Cheshire says and it was a nice, perfect one, we would not have this situation. I come back to the difference between expectations and price. Part of the problem you might have in making the economics work is getting landowners in urban areas to be prepared to sell at more realistic prices that would encourage all sorts of things to happen. I take the view that the land market in urban areas is very dysfunctional, and part of the result of that—it is not the only cause—is extensive land vacancy.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Cheshire</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I am sceptical of the evidence of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">dysfunctionality</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. The problem is that any action is about something that is going to happen quite a long time in the future. It requires investment now if you are going to develop or remediate a piece of land, but your returns are quite a long time in the future. You also have to negotiate a Government process, planning process and so on, so there is an awful lot of uncertainty associated with these things. If the holding costs are low, which is a possible argument for a vacant land tax, it simply may make commercial sense to sit on land for a very long time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q364 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I think we now have a much greater understanding of what we do not understand.

When inheritance tax relief was introduced, over a relatively short time, it was capitalised into the price of agricultural land. You can compare the price of agricultural land in Britain with similarly productive land in, say, France where you have common agricultural policy support but a lower regime of tax advantages associated with it, and you see a lower price for agricultural land. That is not 100% proof. You could commission better proof, but you would have to do the research. As far as I am concerned, I am convinced that that is the case.

Earlier on, you seemed to be saying that, in general, interventions do not work; they have unexpected consequences, and, to be frank, we should probably take away some of the ones we have. But you have just said that the potential for a vacant land tax as an intervention might be a way of dealing with some of those things.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Cheshire</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: If you want to bring forward development. It was a conditional statement. It depends on what your policy objectives are. Broadly, there are reasons for having comparable tax treatment for all productive assets. Land is a productive asset. You might argue that there are social dimensions to land use, but there are certainly environmental issues associated with land use which suggest you should have a particular tax treatment to favour certain categories. In general, the lower the prices of agricultural land, the more variety of ownership and the more environmental benefits you will get.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q368 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mike </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Crockart</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What is your view of a land value tax, or is the problem there in defining what the value is?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Cheshire</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: You are back to taking with one hand and giving back with the other.

It seems to me that the enormous distortions in the urban market arise from the planning system and the separation of use categories. You are allocating supply for different uses independently of market prices and generating distortions at quite incredible levels. For example, agricultural land to the north of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Oxford</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is worth about £10,000 a hectare.

I have slightly different figures, but the point is correct. Within the kinds of urban areas I am talking about, which are the industrial areas of Scotland that have undergone huge structural change, it is not very hard to persuade the planners to give you permission for whatever you want to do. In those areas—we are a million miles from the south-east of England—the huge constraint is not planning. They will welcome you with open arms. There has been criticism of the way </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Glasgow</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has regenerated over a period of 20 or 30 years.

If you look at the price of land zoned for industry relative to land zoned for housing, there is a big discontinuity there.

What are the key issues that need to be addressed?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Adams</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The tie-up between urban land reform and rural land reform is all about property rights. The issue would be: who owns and exercises the property rights? Property rights are conditioned by statute, custom and so on and so forth. Previously, one is starting to question whether a property right that enables you to hold land indefinitely, which I talked about a moment ago, is in the public interest, but let’s move on from that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Another issue is where you are trying to put together a major redevelopment site. Whether it is in the city centre or the edge of the city does not really matter. Particularly in urban areas, we will often find many different property right holders with different ownership interests. It is a patchwork. Either the local authority comes in and compulsorily purchases the whole lot—the evidence tells us that that happens very rarely—or the private developer operates secretly over a period of time, gradually trying to assemble it, which is a very inefficient way of doing it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">One issue that has come up in my paper is the suggestion that in those kinds of circumstances we adopt the legislation that applies in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Hong Kong</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, for example. They have a similar problem but it is much more evident because they have a lot of multi-storey buildings. Imagine a multi-storey building in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Hong Kong</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> with 100 different owners and trying to get that together for redevelopment. Many of those buildings are past their sell-by date and you could put something more viable there.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Under our system, the private developer would have to negotiate individually with all 100 owners, or the local authority would put in a compulsory purchase order and buy them all out. The legislation introduced in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Hong Kong</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is such that the private owner simply has to buy up 90% and at that point can go for what you might regard as a privatised form of compulsory purchase. I will not go into the details of that, but that is basically what it is. It is the same sort of principle as company acquisition.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The advantage of it is that previously there was a reason to be the last person to sell. If you were the 100th person and he had bought all 99, you could hold him to ransom. You do not know where you will be in the queue. You might be very happy being the 89th because you can still hold him to ransom, but you do not want to be the 90th or 91st person to sell because your bargaining power has gone. In that kind of arrangement, you have redefined the property right to overcome what is primarily an issue of market failure. You have said, “We will deal with that issue of market failure without necessarily going through a big compulsory purchase. We will deal with it by trying to deal with the way the market operates.” That is an example of what one could do in terms of urban land reform. It would be reform of property rights to speed up redevelopment without the need for compulsory purchase.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q398 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Professor Cheshire, do you want to add anything to that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Cheshire</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: A classic problem of land markets is land assembly and the hold-out problem, as it is called, which has been described. I have one slight worry, which you would have to pay attention to. It is easy in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Hong Kong</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> where you are dealing with a vertical structure because it is defined before you start, but, if you are talking about land assembly, what is 90%? Ninety per cent. of what? In some sense, the intended developer would have to identify the area over which they were wishing to assemble ahead of time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Adams</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: You would probably need to tie that up with at least some acknowledgement by the public authority early on that the area identified by the developer was a suitable one for redevelopment, but it could be done. You could set up the system in such a way, so that is an example where you could make the market work a lot better.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q399 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mike </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Crockart</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I have a very quick question about the community right to buy. At the moment, it is very much a rural matter. There are conditions attached to it about the size of the community. We have heard evidence in this inquiry that that should be made universal so it could be brought in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">in</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> an urban situation.

The consultation responses were overwhelmingly in favour of extending the right to buy to urban areas. I think the principle is one that has quite broad support. There were very few people arguing against it. The issue is obviously </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">operationalising</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> it. How do you define the community in an urban area? That is not insurmountable. You might need to take small rather than large distances; you may need to define the community in different ways. For example, there are community councils in urban areas that represent parts of urban areas, so there are a number of ways in which it would be possible to identify the community so it was not one or two individuals.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36.85pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q400 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lindsay Roy:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> My apologies, gentlemen.

The scope of this inquiry is quite wide. In relation to the operation of land markets, are there topics or questions that you think we should pay particular attention to, in addition to those that you have discussed today? In other words, are there any answers you have prepared to questions that you thought we might have asked but have not so far asked?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Cheshire</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think we have covered quite a lot of the ground over which I think I have expertise. The basic issue is capitalisation and how relatively effective land markets are at capitalising all sorts of what one might think are extraordinarily intangible values, like expected future aircraft noise, local graffiti or quality of fishing. All of this is reflected in land prices. That was the basic message I wanted to get across, and that applies to these tax incentives, tax breaks and subsidies as well.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Adams</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Although I disagree with the application of a number of the ideas that Professor Cheshire is putting forward, the fundamental principle is that the way land markets in this country work is very directly conditioned by law and policy. It is possible for Parliament and the Government to make major changes to the operation of land markets by setting the context slightly differently. We should not think of land markets as something natural that appear from the sky like the weather. Land markets are constructed through social relationships but also through Government policy and legislation. All that can reconstruct land markets in a different way.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Professor Cheshire</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I entirely agree. Property rights are not given by God; they are defined by law, and exactly how they are defined is reflected in the prices people will pay in land markets. Coming back to the issue of 12% of land under uncertain ownership, I suggest it is very likely that that land would sell at a discount because of the uncertainty of ownership.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Colleagues, are there any final points?
