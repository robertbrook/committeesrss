In terms of the Scotland Act 1998 (as amended), the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament is limited by expressly reserved matters (such as matters relating to business associations, in terms of Head C – Trade and Industry of Part 2 of Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act 1998, a point noted below). </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">The devolution settlement also restricts the Scottish Parliament’s powers in terms of the law of the European Union (“EU”) and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ("ECHR"). Whilst the UK Parliament is not strictly policed by a statute in the same way as the Scottish Parliament, that does not mean that EU and ECHR concerns can be ignored. Any attempt to regulate land to the detriment of (for example) the operation of the single market could not realistically be introduced (as highlighted in the case of case 182/83, </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Fearon</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic"> v Irish Land Commission</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">, where provisions that subjected non-Irish nationals to an expropriation regime not applicable to Irish nationals was held to be contrary to EU law).

The ECHR carries certain positive obligations for signatory states, by which it is meant duties that a state cannot shirk, when it comes to property rights. Conceptualisations of the right to property do not necessarily stop at the negative obligation on states not to interfere, rather there might be a positive obligation on a state to ensure individual welfare for all citizens. This might be most obvious in certain (admittedly idiosyncratic) cases relating to Article 8 (on the need to respect private and family life, home and correspondence) and certain interferences with traditional ways of life, as discussed in the case of </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Codona</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic"> v UK (App. No.485/05), admissibility decision of February 7, 2006</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> (analysed in </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Combe</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">, 'Human rights, limited competence and limited partnerships: </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Salvesen v Riddell</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">', 2012 Scots Law Times, at 193 – 200). In terms of comparative law, comparisons with South Africa may be instructive, where there has been a recognisable movement towards a more social role for property law (see A J van </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">der</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> Walt "Ownership and Eviction: Constitutional Rights in Private Law" (2005) 9 Edinburgh Law Review 32).</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><br style="page-break-before:always; clear:both" /><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; text-decoration:underline">Landownership by Natural and Legal Persons</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">In Scots law, there are generally no restrictions as to who, or what, can own land, subject to restrictions otherwise imposed by law (perhaps insolvency law or issues of capacity that might render a transaction void or voidable) and (if relevant) rules relating to a legal person (meaning a non-flesh and blood human being) being validly incorporated. This gives a general starting point that Scottish and non-Scottish entities can own land in the jurisdiction of Scotland. There are perhaps two effects of this that are worth considering from a UK rather than a devolved Scots law perspective. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">The first relates to publicity as to what is referred to as the “beneficial ownership” of land when it is owned by a legal person. If the beneficial ownership of land is unclear, it may be difficult for local or neighbouring community groups to enter into meaningful dialogue with the relevant people who make decisions relating to that land. There may also be issues from a tax enforcement perspective. To the extent that these are problems worth addressing (on which no comment is offered here), if there was to be some kind of reform to encourage more advertisement of who the beneficial owner of land (or rather, the beneficial owner of the entity that owns the land) actually is, or perhaps even to regulate what entities can hold land to prevent some of the more secretive corporate structures being deployed, such reforms would relate to a reserved area of law and as such would be more suited to Westminster than </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Holyrood</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> for legislation.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">A second point is that transfers of land that are owned by a legal person can be (effectively) made in two ways. The land itself can be transferred, or “shares” in the land-holding entity can be transferred, leaving the underlying ownership situation unchanged, at least as far as Registers of Scotland would be concerned.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">The community right to buy contained in Part 2 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 gives a community a right of first refusal over land that it may target for acquisition in its locality. It has been referred to as the community “right to register” rather than a “right to buy” in some literature as, by definition, a pre-emption can only work when a sale is contemplated. Where land is owned by a company, for example, and shares in it are transferred, the pre-emption is not activated (see </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Combe</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">, "Parts 2 and 3 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003: A Definitive Answer to the Scottish Land Question?", 2006 Juridical Review 195). Such a transfer offers a particularly effective avoidance mechanism to the community right to buy. If there was to be some kind of reform to regulate “share” transfers of landowning entities, that would relate to a reserved area of law and as such would be more suited to Westminster than </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Holyrood</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; text-decoration:underline">Fiscal Measures</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Land reform can be cajoled by fiscal means, whether by way of incentives or levies relating to management activities (perhaps relating to flora or fauna on the site) or indeed non-activity (perhaps land-banking). In addition to the benefit of encouraging or discouraging certain activities, a tax on immoveable property in any jurisdiction benefits from being inherently tricky to avoid, as the assets in question cannot be moved offshore. If that aspect of avoidance is removed, foreign domiciled (or seated) landowners would be subject to a tax in a manner that hitherto has not been applicable. To the extent that fiscal measures should be deployed as a means towards land reform (on which no comment is offered here), careful consideration of how such reforms might affect investment in Scotland as compared to the rest of the UK, not to mention enforcement powers of (presumably) Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, would be advisable prior to the introduction of any such fiscal measures.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">September 2013</span></p><p style="line-height:12pt; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:10pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
