If the CQC are seen to ignore concerns raised, then individuals will not be encouraged to speak out. Indeed, when I met recently with the CQC, they appeared surprised that I provided them with details of an incident that I had no personal knowledge of, but the details of which had been provided to me by another member of staff who was unwilling to raise the issue themselves. I do not think the CQC appreciate how reluctant</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">NHS staff remain to raise concerns. I believe from my experience that the CQC has not established ‘proper procedures’ to support whistleblowers who report cases to the CQC, as was found to be required by the Committee at the 2012 accountability hearing</span><a name="_ftnref3"></a><a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> and needs to do so urgently.</span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">I believe that the CQC needs to undertake further improvements in the manner in which it makes judgments about the ability of professional staff within an organisation to raise concerns, as was previously raised by the Committee</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">.</span><a name="_ftnref4"></a><a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">I believe the CQC needs to undertake more rigorous inspections.

I am concerned that I raised issues that I am told have been investigated by the CQC, yet there is no record of this in the public domain nor am I provided with any detail of what has been found. Equally, it seems entirely inappropriate that Trust’s responses to any findings of non-compliance are not published. I believe such publication is necessary as part of open dialogue to ensure that the essential standards are met.
