Teamwork is one of the primary tools in the program’s work model and its main objective is to encourage </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">collaboration</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> between students from different groups. The integration between Israelis an</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">d Palestinians poses a chall</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">enge for most students</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">, as it requires them to contend with contradicting opinions and even carry out decisions taken by the group that run contrary to their own preferences. The most successful teams are usually those that have</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> talked through the difficulties and have undergone a mutual process from beginning to end. Evaluations demonstrate that the degree of cooperation substantially increases with familiarity and experience. Dealing with these challenges is a significant educa</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">tional and personal process for students. Throughout the course, </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">participants learn how to contend with opinions and positions that are different, at times even contradictory, to their own, to conduct themselves as a group that affords equal importance to </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">a variety of opinions, and to move forward by </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">persuading </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">others</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> to adopt a fresh viewpoint</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">. Evaluations demonstrate that the longer students have been participating in the program, the more at ease they are working with members of other teams.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">Deeper Und</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">erstanding</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic"> Curriculum</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">11</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">. In addition to the academic and professional components of the program, MEET has developed a ‘Deeper Understanding’ (DU) curriculum that focuses on promoting dialogue and conflict resolution. It is a </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">values-based education that teaches youth how to communicate and deal with different subjects, such as respect, </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">identity </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">and “the other.”</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> The main purpose of these sessions is to provide students with a framework where the</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">y can express themselves openly</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">, a</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">nd to discuss the difficulties Israelis and Palestinians</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> experience</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> as a means of learning and attaining tools to deal with conflict situations in real life. It allows subjects and stress points that are naturally kept under the surface to become exposed i</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">n order to equip the youth with tools to express themselves in relation to a complex situation</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">, and </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">expand their critical thinking abilities as a result of </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">encountering new</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">perspectives</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">. The direct effect of the DU sessions is that they strengthen social c</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">onnections between students, which allows them to expand the range of topics they are able to discuss to include deeper and more sensitive subjects of a social and political nature. DU encourages students to behave in a responsible and mature manner, decre</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ases disciplinary issues, and fosters a more productive environment. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">12</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">.

Evaluations clearly demonstrate that the longer the students have been in the program, the more frequent and significant social interactions become. At a certain point in the program, trust is born through mutual familiarity an</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">d interaction between the youth, creating a shift in the perceptions and opinions for the other group. Most students arrive at the program never having met someone from the other nationality. Many described their surprise at having discovered the many s</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">imi</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">larities between themselves.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">16</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">One of the most significant accomplishments of the program is the participants reaching a mutual understanding that they are not essentially different from their counterparts on the other side, and that they have the abilit</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">y to communicate with one another and connect on a personal level. MEET succeeds in overcoming the primary obstacle of perceiving others as essentially different from oneself (dehumanizing the other). During the course of the program, youth from both sides</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> come to the realization that they deal with similar problems, are troubled by similar issues, and enjoy similar activities. This realization is a significant milestone for a more comprehensive social change. Understanding points of similarity creates fert</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">ile ground for the emergence of personal ties and deeper acquaintance.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">17. Both internal and external evaluations of our programs have indicated that MEET causes students to: understand each other’s narratives; care about the future of their respective and</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> shared societies; commit to giving back to their communities; believe that joint Israeli and Palestinian efforts will lead to a better and more peaceful region for all; have higher self-esteem and self-confidence; and are driven to become successful in bu</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">siness.
