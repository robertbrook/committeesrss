In England, for example, the Skills Funding Agency has matched ESF funds with its own allocation and commissioned a number of rounds aimed at moving Neet young people into education, employment and training. The Prince’s Trust has delivered a number of these projects.  In addition, we have funded business start-up and self-employment provision through ESF, for example in Wales. For some geographies and for some client groups in particular, self-employment is one of the few positive options open. Youth unemployment is a major structural issue facing all MS to some degree; it therefore makes sense for the European Union to devote significant resource to one of the most challenging problems of our time.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.35pt; text-indent:-28.35pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="2" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14pt; padding-left:14.35pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The ‘added value’ of EU funds will depend upon the extent to which suitable initiatives are already in place. In April 2013 the European Council made a recommendation that MS implement a ‘Youth Guarantee’ of which would include a job, traineeship or other ‘offer’ to all young people under 25 years who have been out of work for at least 4 months. A number of these initiatives are already in place in the UK in one form or another. Demand-led initiatives (which take labour market demand as their starting point) are delivered in the UK, including work experience as part of the Work Programme or Mandatory Work-Related Experience. A delegate from The Prince’s Trust recently attended a Mutual Learning Programme in Brussels on the implementation of the Youth Guarantee. It was evident that some MS were behind the UK in this regard and tended to focus on supply side interventions. Therefore in the UK, European funding would be best used helping to prepare young people for Traineeships and also to tackle Early School Leaving and ensure that the benefits of the Raising of the Participation Age in England are fully realized. They should also be invested in preparing young people for the kinds of personal and workplace skills they will need to meet the economy of tomorrow. This would add value to UK provision, which is focused on shorter term goals of getting young people into work and training.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.35pt; text-indent:-28.35pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="3" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14pt; padding-left:14.35pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">No response submitted</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.35pt; text-indent:-28.35pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="4" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14pt; padding-left:14.35pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">As a provider we recognize that a proper audit trail for the defrayal of public funds is necessary. There is a view that European funding involves a disproportionate focus on auditing expenditure and not enough focus on monitoring outcomes and impact. (It is unclear whether this derives from Europe or gilt-edging /risk averseness on the part of the United Kingdom). We would welcome a ‘black box’ approach which gave providers greater freedom to achieve desired outcomes using techniques and methods which they felt best suited to their client group. This could include Payment by Results models, although these models would need to be structured so as to allow the voluntary sector to participate more actively than they have on the Work Programme. There has been some discussion about establishing a common cost base for various outcomes which might reduce audit requirements. However the extent to which this </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">methodology will be adopted is unclear; for example is there a conflict with the need to tender open and competitively?  At the Mutual Learning Programme, the Commission impressed upon MS the importance of building monitoring and evaluation into the Youth Guarantee implementation plan. It would be beneficial for MS to establish a metric of impacts, for example net value to the economy of a job, the cost of out of work benefits etc so that the impact of expenditure could be better evaluated. This would need to be done on a MS basis.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.35pt; text-indent:-28.35pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="5" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14pt; padding-left:14.35pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The Youth Employment Initiative will have relatively little impact in the UK as most geographies have less than 25% youth unemployment. It would be useful if the bar could be lowered to enable more young people to benefit from this initiative. YEI funds need to be committed in a shorter period of time; it therefore suits projects which are more or less shovel-ready. We would suggest that they are suited to demand-side initiatives, for example leveraging job outcomes from housing market renewal, retro-fit and infrastructure projects.  On the other hand, ESF funds are aligned to the 2014-20 EU budgetary period and will entail programmes aimed at structural reform, innovation and filling the gaps between statutory provision. Some of them should be spent on helping people furthest from the labour market, for example those for who the Work Programme might not be effective. This includes people with multiple needs, who may have been in trouble with the law. Other ESF funds should be deployed in structural initiatives, for example bridging the gap between young people’s skills sets (or lack of) and the sectors (such as science and technology) where there are likely to be jobs which create wealth. A recent OECD report highlighted these challenges for the UK.  There needs to be careful thought in use of these funds and programme design. Most of these funds are devolved to Local Enterprise Partnerships in England; these bodies are currently drafting their Business Plans and explaining how they will invest EU Structural Funds.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.35pt; text-indent:-28.35pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="6" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 14pt; padding-left:14.35pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The Prince’s Trust, along with other organisations operating in this market, put a high premium on youth consultation and where possible involvement in governance.

At the same time, not all young people are engaged with technology, and many of those who do, engage in limited ways (for example they are able to use Facebook but couldn’t submit an online CV). The Prince’s Trust has identified a need to embed the use of technology in its programmes and is devoting resource to doing so. In terms of new ways of working, we would recommend the importance of working with employers, engaging them not only in the design and delivery of work experience programmes but also in measures which will improve the prospects of young people more generally. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.35pt; text-indent:-28.35pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.35pt; text-indent:-28.35pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">25 October 2013</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
