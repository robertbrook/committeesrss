Consideration has to be given in each case whether the repeal of the Act needs to be accompanied by a further savings provision or by a textual amendment in another Act.  Following discussions with HM Revenue and Customs in 2012, the Commission’s proposal to repeal many tax Acts in 2013 was able to proceed with an appropriate savings provision to ensure that the repeals did not have retrospective effect. </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT';

Moreover, secondary legislation can usually be revoked using the same powers that created it, without any need for fresh primary legislation.  That said, the Commission’s SLR Acts do sometimes revoke secondary legislation, especially when this relates in some way to a current project to repeal obsolete primary legislation.  For example the 2013 SLR Act, when repealing the Tax Acts referred to above, also </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">revoked</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> a number of tax regulations contained in secondary legislation.  It may be possible for future SLR Bills to include a selection of obsolete regulations and orders where there being no other practicable means of revoking them.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Questions specifically raised by the Committee</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Q10  Is</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic"> a new “power to </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">disapply</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic"> legislation no longer of practical use” necessary or are there existing procedures which could be used to achieve the same effect?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The existing statutory powers in the Law Commissions Act 1965 and in the Standing Orders of both Houses of Parliament enable the Commission (and the Scottish Law Commission) to recommend the repeal of obsolete legislation.  These powers have been exercised regularly over the past 48 years to produce 19 Statute Law (Repeals) Acts which have repealed large volumes of obsolete statutory material.  On that basis, it is not clear why a new power to </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">disapply</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> or repeal obsolete primary legislation is needed.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The position concerning secondary legislation (typically regulations and orders, many of which are contained in statutory instruments) is rather different.  The Commission’s powers to recommend the repeal of obsolete legislation extend to secondary legislation as well as primary legislation.
