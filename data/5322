</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Thank you all very much for coming in.  You will know that the Committee visited </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Burma</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> last month and had an extremely interesting and informative trip.  In this session, we are looking at DFID’s engagement with the health sector.  I know that ICAI was </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">reasonably</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> complimentary about the work that was being done, but it is a major part of DFID’s budget</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">nearly half of their budget for the 2012</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">15 period.  Of £63.4</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">million for that period, £45.8</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">million is on community and maternal health, and £17.6</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">million on malaria.  The question that was raised with us is, given spending on health in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Burma</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has been chronically low, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">although</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> DFID has been a contributor throughout the period, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">whether</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> that level of commitment </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">is </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">at the right level</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">  The point that has been made to us is that, if you wanted to be transformational, it may not be big enough</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> on the other hand, it is rather too big to be just pilot schemes.  What is your take on whether or not it is balanced right and can it be transformational at that level?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mark Foster</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: First of all, as you will have recognised from your visit, the needs with regard to healthcare in Burma remain incredibly high, and the overall levels of spend by the Government, for example, remain low compared to many of the other countries in the area.  In terms of the need for there to be investment in the broader health sector</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> that need is very clearly there and all the indicators point to continuing needs in many key areas.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">What we have found from our review was that, clearly, the money that DFID had been spending had been well spent and well targeted.  Indeed</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> the programmes and the plans—the 3MDG programme is now the major focus of activity—look also to be well targeted and working on the right kinds of things.  </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Also</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, it looks reasonably well set up to have a meaningful and substantive impact, higher than the impact that has been had before, primarily because there is more funding going into that programme, but also because, with the changed nature of the relationship with the Government of Burma, and particularly the Ministry of Health, there is a chance of working and leveraging that work more effectively on the ground.  There is an opportunity for that piece of work to be transformational in the areas where it is focused.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It is of course focused on a subset of the townships.  The question mark is: could you do more by moving out to more townships?  From our assessment looking at the picture, it would be better to say, if you could really prove you could have a real impact first of all in those places, you would feel more confident of scaling and having a broader transformational effect once that had been proven.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You would need two or three years.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mark Foster</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There is probably some time to be found.  Learning how to work on the ground there and to be effective, alongside an evolving governmental system, would seem to me to be worth thinking through.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Fiona Campbell</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I would echo what has been said today.  I would say that DFID has been very good in the way it has used its money in terms of a transformational approach, in that it has not just delivered programmes, but it has delivered them in a way that has been building the systems and the structures.  The joint initiative was a very good example, where they used the opportunity in the delta to work within the system.  Okay, sanctions were in place so there were restrictions, but the opportunities that were presented in supporting midwives, in supporting their transport out into villages, showed what was possible if you do invest in a certain way.  They have used the money extremely well to really show how the system can work better, and that is where the transformation happens.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">As has been said with 3MDG in terms of the way it is trying to approach, yes, it is only in 42 townships but, if it can show that, in those townships, it is possible to deliver services to hard</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">to</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">reach</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> areas and to vulnerable populations, then that in itself shows you what is possible if you put money in, and the money will come from other places in the future.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">So y</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">ou think this is about the right level of funding.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Fiona Campbell</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is a massively underfunded health sector at the moment.  There is room for additional funding to go in, but </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">where </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">the funding </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">is going in it </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">is having a bigger effect than just the programmes it is supporting.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Charles Nelson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I would actually agree with the other two here that</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, given</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> the sort of acti</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">vities that have been going on and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">the restraints under which we have been having to operate inside Myanmar, the money has been remarkably well spent.  It has allowed the communities that need it the most to get healthcare in a way that was sustainable and engaging the communities that were there.  Clearly, if there was opportunity to do more, more could be done, but that does not mean that the existing levels would not be, in their own way, transformational.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q33 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Is this likely to have an effect on the Myanmar/Burma Government?  Clearly they do not have huge resources, but they have under</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">spent</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> to such an astonishing degree.  Do you think that DFID might effectively persuade them that what is happening justifies their diverting some more funds?  Is there any evidence they would be prepared to do that?  Do any of you have a view on that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Fiona Campbell</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I have been there for two years and, certainly in terms of what has been said, there is a commitment to increase spend.  They have made a commitment to universal health coverage, for instance.  Universal health coverage means that everybody should have access to the healthcare they need.  In order to do that, there is going to have to be a massive scale</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">up</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in terms of infrastructure, staff, drugs and equipment getting out there.  That in itself is already acknowledging that there needs to be an investment in the system.  Actually what you are doing is raising the expectations within the population that they can have services.  That in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">itself</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, you would hope, would ultimately put pressure on the Government to increase its allocation.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q34 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> From what you have said, although it is nearly 50% of DFID’s budget, and you are a specialist in health so you are going to say that, is it justified to spend that proportion of the budget on health?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mark Foster</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Clearly one of the things that we found in the report was a sense that health had been a safe place for DFID to work during the time of the EU prohibitions on working there.  Therefore, it is </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">an area</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> where we have been able to build up a foundational position, w</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">hich allows further spend of this</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> scale to be standing on firmer ground.  There are other areas where we are just starting to think about spending money; they become the areas with regard to governance, which is another topic we may come on to talk about later on, where you will be at the very early stage of spend there.  Therefore, thinking about how to put more money through those channels would be something to be questioned until the ground had been set.  The sense that we had here was firm foundations had been </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">laid</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">; good relationships had been established with the Ministry of Health</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">; t</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">he needs had been identified pretty well.  Therefore, scaling up to a degree would make sense to be </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">the</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> next big focus in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">early </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">stage of the relationship with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Burma</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Fiona Campbell</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The other point is that, of course, there are a number of sectors that you could put money into in Myanmar at the moment but, if you look in terms of the population, out</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">of</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">pocket payments for health are a major contributor to people’s impoverishment.  The </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt"> Good morning.  Now that sanctions have been lifted against </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Burma</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, for the first time, we can provide development assistance directly through the Government of Burma.  Does the Government have the capacity to provide sector support in health and what are the risks of corruption?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mark Foster</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: First of all, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">our own perspective was that, while things have opened up, still providing money directly through the Government was something to be thought carefully about.  The new programme around the 3MDG programme is still being largely managed through the fund management vehicle of UNOPS.  Our overall sense is there is a stronger opportunity to work more closely with</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> the Ministry of Health about the deployment of these funds and, indeed, to use part of these funds to strengthen their ability to manage this.  One thing we were encouraged by, looking at the follow</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">up from DFID to our review, was their comeback with regard to how much of this energy is going to go into building up the financial management strengths and accountability of the Government, which would then allow, in future, more funds to be put more directly through that route.  The key thing here is it</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> still early days.  We felt the fiduciary controls DFID had put in place were appropriate, even though some of the people in the chain felt that they were burdensome.  Our feeling was this is still a time to be really tight; it is a time to be focused, but to deploy some of your funds towards building up capacity in the system to allow future different models.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Fiona Campbell</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I agree.  I think it is a very important route to go down, but it is a process.  Capacity is needed at all sorts of levels.  At township level, for instance, where they will be receiving funds and allocating them for services within the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">township, that</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> requires people who are able to manage finances at that level.  I know, just before I left, in the townships that are working, there sometimes are no people who have good financial management skills.  That is one of the things that, at September time, basically they had sanctioned new positions at township level, recognising that you need to have that capacity there, but that also requires them to be skilled and to be supported.  That is a process; it takes time.  You need to make sure that those steps are in place before you can put money through, but I think that is definitely the way that it needs to go in country.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Charles Nelson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I would be supportive.  You seem to be getting agreement across the table.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt;

font-size:12pt">National Malaria Control </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">board and so on, they are very enthusiastic to find ways to grow and to get better at the task that they have in front of them, and they are being given the liberty to do it now, which they have not had until recently.  The right kind of investment in capacity building through the system is going to be important, but not rushed.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt">medical level?  </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Perhaps you could maybe give some practical examples of where that gap </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">: The gap is significant, in the sense that the ability to actually control activity from end to end that you need for a good health system has not been there.  They have had a very strong plan in place since 1972.  The plan is clear so, within a plan, it is possible to work to build the skills.  Practically</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">on</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> the point that Fiona made about the townships, that is where it becomes weakest, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">in terms of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">the connectivity between the townships and the villages that those townships serve, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">the facilities connecting with the communities</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> There are big gaps in that process, but the people there are highly capable when given the opportunity to do it.  The training can be done quite fast, but it needs time to be proven.  There are very practical things of getting a supply chain that works end to end </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">and</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is delivering the right things to the right places, and people knowing how to use that clinically in appropriate ways.  It would be the example for me of where we need to close the gap.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt;

font-size:12pt">would also require us to identify what gaps were there in terms of skills.  They are across the board.  Look at all the building blocks of the health system, whether it is human resource management, whether it is supply chain, whether it is financial management, leadership and governance</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt"> there is very good capacity in terms of technical capacity, but how is that then put into practice in terms of making decisions, developing plans, developing policies?  There are gaps, yes, and there is a lot of work to be done to fill them.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mark Foster</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I would draw an analogy from my recent experiences in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Kenya</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, where there has obviously been a recent devolution of the health management structure to the counties, which is a bit analogous to what is happening to the townships in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Burma</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.  The level of ambition you see is immediately naturally there in these new groups that, for the first time, see </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">themselves managing a particular area, but the level of ambition clearly is out of all proportion to the reality on the ground.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I think that one of the things that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">is</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> important about the focus of even the work that DFID does fund in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Burma</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> around health is to keep an eye on getting the basics right first.  That is around the basics of things like the supply chain, the core skills and the delivery of basic services.  You can start to think too much about structuring the whole health system.  There does have to be health system strengthening activity, yes, but it is about pacing it at the right level.  I would say helping the townships to set their bars at the right level, and then funding practical activities on the ground that build that base capacity, would be where I would make sure that our energies were focused.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

it was building in lots of different pieces of the jigsaw puzzle.  There had been some issues with the establishment of the fund management vehicles for it as well, and what </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">, but you are building a platform, whichever mechanism you use to build it.  If malaria is the primary thing, then build it off malaria.  If it is maternal and child health more broadly, then you can build a wider system from it.  I would not be too concerned at the moment that the focus is wrong, but you do get some very large commitments each time you take on a policy to support all HIV sufferers.  You cannot stop once you start.  It is critical that, as you take each of these on, it is clear what impact it has on the system, which is then able to function with the additional burden that it is given.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

that is what it should be.  We need to find a way to make the total community affected by HIV accessing as the commitment of the Government is, but it will take time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">as </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">the private sector.  The private sector is very diverse; it can be public sector workers working out of hours in the private sector.  Getting an understanding of how they are working together and what the incentives are for people to go to public or private is really important.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt"> It is very nice to see all of you.  Obviously we have described this report under the short headline of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">“</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">democracy and development</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">”</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.  This is really focusing to some extent on the democracy bit.  Our judgment was that we have potentially an emerging democracy or some form of democracy and the hope that that might give space to create development.  What we are looking for from you is what your view on that is and also suggestions you may have as to how we can take advantage constructively of that opportunity.  We have just come back and we all have the same questions: how is it in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Burma</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">?  What is happening?  It is kind of at an apparent crossroads.  We have a ceasefire; I am not sure we have a peace process.  We have discussions about constitutional change, but they do not seem to be very active.  Perhaps the first question to ask is what your take is on what you see</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> as</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> the peace process and the constitutional process, both of which seem to be fairly crucial as to whether or not we have a long</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">: I should have perhaps added, Chair, at the beginning, I am currently a distinguished visiting fellow at Chatham House looking at processes of transition towards reform and democracy, on the one hand in the Arab world, and on the other in Southeast Asia, which I know very well.  I believe I sent a short note to the Committee last week.  That reflects my view that the situation in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Burma</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Myanmar</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, is really quite promising.  It is useful to have historical and comparative frameworks.  I know Indonesia well</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> which, like Burma, had a long period of military rule—in the case of Indonesia, 33</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">years—and is now one of the most robust democracies in the developing world.  I am confident that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Burma</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> can eventually get to that spot.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">If one reviews the past few years, one sees certain highlights.  One is the relationship between President </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Thein</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">.  I have had the privilege of chairing meetings where both of those spoke on different occasions at Chatham House, and I believe the commitment is there.  It is very interesting, when the by</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">elections took place in April last year, 2012, and of course the NLD virtually swept the board, 41 out of 44 seats, there was no adverse reaction from the regime, from the military, in that respect.  I expect elections to go ahead in 2015.  There are many major questions that hang around that, not least the question of constitutional reform.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">October, where for the first time the 17 armed insurgency groups came together with the Government and agreed a ceasefire.  Again, as I believe you referred, what we need is not just a ceasefire but </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">political progr</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">ess that can build on that, otherwise it will slip back.  Finally</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">Burma</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> four times in the last year and a half and more than 40 </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">times</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> altogether, if I include the border areas, over 15 years.  I would like to start certainly by acknowledging the very significant changes that all of us would see.  I have witnessed them first hand.  I have been able to do things in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Burma</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> that would have been inconceivable just a short time ago.  I have just two brief examples that illustrate that.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Earlier this year, I travelled with Lord Alton of Liverpool and we both addressed a public gathering, organised by the National League for Democracy</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in a public restaurant in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Rangoon</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, on the theme of human rights and democracy.  That would have been unimaginable </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">previously</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.  I was there recently in November and again organised, with the NLD, a public meeting at which the Catholic Archbishop of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Rangoon</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> gave a talk on religious harmony and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">peacebuilding</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.  Again, that would </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">have been</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> unimaginable a short time ago.  I was also able to travel recently into Chin state, which was previously part of the country that was totally closed to foreigners.  I gave a three</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">day workshop on human rights.  Those were all extremely significant positive developments.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">H</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">owever, there are two dangers in the international community’s approach.  One is the danger of entrenched cynicism, which would be very understandable given the past record of successive military regimes, but the other danger, which I think is more prevalent, is the danger of what I call premature euphoria.  I wrote an article for the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Wall Street Journal</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> recently and I ended it by saying that “The beginning of the beginning may now have begun.”  In saying that, I want to emphasise that I think, whilst the progress is encouraging in many respects, there is a very long way to go.  You made remarks about the constitutional changes that are needed that we have not yet seen.  Clearly</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> if 2015 is to be a genuine and meaningful election as part of a transition, the constitution needs to be changed before then.  We may, I imagine, come back to these issues.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

that is very welcome.  As you say, so far we have not seen a rush to change the constitution.  I totally agree with Lord Williams that we must follow events and respond to events.  If the constitution changes over the course of 2014 that obviously will make the 2015 elections much more credible and give us more reason for optimism.  So far, I have not seen a good enough match between the language and the action.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt">Yangon</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.  Taking the former situation, there, although the evidence we got was that there had been external incitement, which led to burnings and some deaths, both communities felt that they had been well looked after</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> by the authorities</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.  Ironically in some ways, the Muslim IDP camp felt almost </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">better</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> looked after than the Burmese one.  They were all confident that they would be able to move back and carry on.  Indeed, the local representatives of the National League for Democracy were actually participating in this process of getting things back.  That, whilst it was a disturbing development, gave the impression that it could be rebuilt.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt;

font-size:12pt">Burma</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, there is a very real risk—and we have seen evidence of this already—that what has been happening to Muslims in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Burma</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> has the potential to attract the attention of radical Islamists outside </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Burma</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and for them to use this as a recruiting issue.  We have seen, particularly in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Indonesia</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, a number of calls for Jihad against </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Burma</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">My knowledge of both the wider Muslim community and the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Rohingya</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> community is that there is very little, if any, evidence of an extremist or a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Jihadi</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> movement among Muslims in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Burma</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.  Muslims in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Burma</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, at least in my experience, have tended to be very moderate and not involved in extremist activity, but there is the potential both for them to be radicalised inside the country and for external radical groups to use this issue and, therefore, that is another reason why it should be of deep concern.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In terms of the solution for the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">Rakhine</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> state.  The latest figures from UN Watch are that 143,000 are internally displaced, but thousands have fled the country and are refugees outside the country.  Often they leave on boats in extremely dangerous situations on the seas, and access to the camps is extremely d</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">ifficult.  I am sure you will h</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">ave heard evidence of harassment of aid workers in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Rakhine</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> state, so there is clearly a need for DFID to do more in terms of putting pressure on the regime to open up access to the camps, protection for aid workers to make it possible to address the immediate humanitarian needs.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt">Rohingya</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> are illegal immigrants from </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Bangladesh</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.  The historical record shows very clearly that that is absolutely not true.  As a people, they have been in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Burma</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> for generations and there is plenty of historical evidence for that.  There may be a role for the British Government as a whole to do more in providing independent historical analysis that might actually counter the false propaganda in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Burma</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and help establish the facts about the history of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Rohingya</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Linked to that is the need to maintain and increase pressure on the regime to address the question of citizenship, to amend the 1982 Citizenship Law and to move towards a citizenship law that says that whoever is born in Burma should be recognised as a citizen of Burma.  The citizenship issue by itself is clearly not going to resolve the on</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Greg Power</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I saw the transcript of a recent evidence session when you made this point.  It is clear that DFID has historically preferred working with civil society.  There are probably three reasons for reluctance to prioritise parliaments in particular.  The first is that parliaments are clearly difficult, in the sense that it is politically contentious to try to involve </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">yourself</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in the parliament of another sovereign nation.  It involves you deeply in the politics of that country, which DFID has traditionally been nervous of.  Civil society, by comparison, looks much more apolitical and much easier to do.  It is a good thing.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Secondly, it is much easier to work with the executive than it is with parliaments.  The executive exists to execute decisions.  Parliaments do not actually implement anything.  They are slow; they are laborious; they are deliberat</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">iv</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">e by definition, by design.  They are designed to slow down the process.  There is often a tension between the desire to get things done quickly in situations like </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Burma</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and the desire to slow things down and get the legislation right.  We have been working in Iraq for the last five years with the Council of Representatives there, and I remember being in a meeting in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">one of Sad</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">da</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">m</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’s old palaces, which was substituting as the US embassy at the time, with members of the State Department and members of USAID.  The State Department was very keen to get the legislation through very quickly, whilst USAID was there to slow it down to get the legislative process right.  That tension exists in a lot of approaches to support to parliaments.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The third problem is parliaments are, by definition, complex.  I am</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> often asked the question, “Who i</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">s in charge of the Parliament?”  It could be the Speaker; it could be the Secretary General; it could be the Chairs of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Committees</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.  There is no one person.  Parliaments are unlike any other organisations.  There is no one person in charge who can drive through a process of reform and change.  It is a competing mass of different interests, which change over time.  For those three reasons, not just DFID but donor agencies generally have much preferred to work with civil society, or with the executive at the expense of Parliament, and political parties for that matter.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

I am concerned that DFID spends far more money on parliamentary strengthening than the relatively small grants in aid that the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Foreign Office gives to the Westminster Foundation.  Overwhelmingly, that money is spent with either foreign providers like NDI, a very good organisation, or multinational institutions like the UNDP, with the consequence that we fail to build in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;
