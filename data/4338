font-size:12pt"> Can I thank you very much for coming this afternoon?  We have been trying to hold this session since September, initially on the statistics.  The importance of the Universal Credit element of today’s session has somehow grown in magnitude since the original intention, but if you do not mind, we will start with the Department’s use of statistics.  We have questions that should last about half an hour and then we will move on to the issues around Universal Credit.  The two are not disconnected in any way.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Can I begin by asking what you say when the UK Statistics Authority Chair said that Government statistics should be used as “a torch not a crutch”, to enlighten the debate rather than to prop up a position that has already been agreed and adopted?  Are you satisfied that your use of statistics is aimed at shedding light on DWP activities rather than just gaining support for policy reforms?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr Duncan Smith</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I am, and I think that this is borne out by the reality of the fact that we have published, over the period that I have been there, over 500</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">statistical releases.  We have also started the innovation of ad hoc statistical releases, which we were congratulated for by the UKSA.  They said that the Department for Work and Pensions statisticians have established a page on the Department’s website to provide links to additional statistical analysis and the Authority expects all other Departments not currently doing so to do so likewise.  Our relationship with the UK Authority I think is pretty good.  We try to publish as regularly as possible and we try to stick to the strictures that are laid for the publication of that data.  We try to sell a positive message and I know there have been issues around some negativity with regards to sickness and disability benefits, but to try to counter that, a few months ago we started a campaign called Disability Confident.  We had a big conference in central London, brought a lot of the groups together, also a lot of employers, trying to get them to understand what the needs are of disabled people in employment, to try to counter any negative messages.  That is rolling out around the countryside at the moment, so that backs up some of the use of statistics.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt"> Is it not true that the UK Statistics Authority was very critical of your Department’s use of statistics and said that they have had more complaints about your Department’s use of statistics than any other Department in this Government?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr Duncan Smith</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes, but with respect, Chair, I have had two letters.  One was about something two years ago concerning something about the use of them on immigration, but they let that one sit.  The last one was where we had a discussion around the use of the way I referred to those going back into work on the back of the benefit cap.  They said that whilst we could not prove that they had gone in or could not prove that they had not, but I should therefore not make the link other than that I believe it to be the case that those people are going back into work is hugely to do with the fact that we introduced the cap.  That is my belief, but they said that that should remain as a flat statistic, which we have accepted.  However, as I said, there were 500</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">releases and although they get complaints—and they will get a lot of complaints now because people want to assume that we are saying some of the things that are reported and we are not saying those things—the reality is, my understanding is, that they are very satisfied.  They are satisfied with the way that we run that and that we are doing this in the correct way.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt"> I was thinking of the Chairman of the Conservative Party, who used the statistic that 900,000</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">people had given up their claims to disability benefits rather than go through the test, which Ms</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Gilmore will show was a completely false statistic.  I appreciate you say that you do not control editorial policy, but there certainly have been comments to the press that have conflated statistics, have not put them into context and has led to a great deal of fear and alarm amongst the very people you say that you want to support, those people who have disabilities.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr Duncan Smith</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">:  Can I just, first of all, say that that was made clear at the time by the Statistics Authority that what the Central Office did with these was exactly that, conflate them, but under no assurance from us should they have done that.  We did not and have never given them that idea of those figures and we would not have done so.  That was something that they put together and released themselves.  In fact, I was not even aware that they were going out with the comment at the time.  It is not in our interest for that, because that just raises an issue about statistics and then we have to defend ourselves again.  However, as I say, these were not statistics that were published by us.  They had pulled two things together and conflated them, as you say, but it is not us.  I have had conversations with him and with others about being careful to check with the Department: if they are going to say something about the statistics that are out there, they should check with us that those are the statistics that can be correctly used.  There has been an element of that since then, so there has been less of that going on.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sheila Gilmore:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Thank you, Secretary of State.  In April</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">2013, there were statistics published about DLA claimants and you were quoted as saying, “</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">ve seen a rise in the run-up to PIP. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">And you know why? </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">They know PIP has a health check. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">They want to get in early</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.”  Stories to that effect then appeared in various newspapers, but in fact two</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">thirds of those new claims are from children and pensioners who would not be affected by PIP and there was a fall in the number of claims made by working age claimants.  Therefore, would you accept now that that description, which was your description, was misleading?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr Duncan Smith</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes, but it is taken out of context, because of course it was in a conversation about why some people may or may not have continued with their claims.  I was not referring to absolutely everybody; I was referring to specific groups.  There are other reasons as well; I have always been very clear about that.  The reality is that we have not had any upheld complaint on that particular issue to us from the Statistics Authority, so if somebody wants to come and take it up with them then I am happy to get that in full context.  I do not have the exact context of the discussion or the interview, but I seem to recall that that was done as part of a process of explaining why some people may not have gone ahead with their claims.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr Duncan Smith</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I neither sought the headline nor did I write any headlines.  I am not aware of any headlines on this, by the way; you will have to show it to me, I am not completely aware of it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sheila Gilmore:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt"> Further to that, ESA statistics are published—and have been throughout—about the number of people who are awarded the benefit both before and after appeals.  It is these statistics that are often used to make judgments about whether the benefit is working or not.  In a letter dated 2</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">November to myself from the then Disabilities Minister, it was stated that the before appeals statistics already took into account reconsideration, which is informal appeals, in fact.  Does this not give a misleading impression of how many decisions are subsequently overturned?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr Duncan Smith</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: No.  I am trying to remember the thing you refer to.  If I recall correctly, we then did not publish data on appeals because we were out of sync with the Justice</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sheila Gilmore:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Secretary of State, can I just stop you there, because that is a separate point that I also wanted to ask you about.  The point was what is counted as a before and after appeal figure, and in the figures for before appeal, when contrasted with the figures of after appeal, reconsiderations are counted in the before appeal figure.  If a reconsideration overturns the WCA, then it surely should be added to the number of decisions that are subsequently overturned.  It is not right first time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">interviews or even making an effort to find those jobs.  For the most part, they are there to say we cannot go on letting you just take the money and not do what you were meant to do and I think that is really, in essence, the contract.  Therefore, it is a fair statement to say that this is the case, that in fact that is what the sanctions are there to do.  However, I would also remind you, Chair and the Committee, that under the last Government similar assumptions were made about the sanctions regime throughout and it was, in fact, an ex</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">year period was </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">almost certainly too long and one of the things that we are discussing with the NAO separately is the way in which we apply accounting policies towards software code as we go forward.  However, the important thing that I would want to stress to you is that not only have we done an impairment review to determine whether or not we have value greater than the carrying value of our assets, we have also done a value-in-use calculation.  We have looked at the asset that we have and have used the Treasury Green Book methodology to determine what net present value or what value to the taxpayer we will obtain from using that asset and it is substantially more than the value of that asset, even taking into account the write off that you describe and any further investment that we might have to make into that asset as we move to other elements of Universal Credit.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

you have to prove what you are doing when you change circumstance.  If you want to open a new bank account, you have to go and present yourself.  I have talked to a lot of financial institutions about these things and that is exactly where they are coming from as well.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt"> Could I start with a question about timing?  To me, it is clear that something can work but take time rolling it out more fully, which seems to be your position.  However, I wanted to ask a question on this.  What timeframe are you looking at in terms of being able to present your revised business case for the IT to the Treasury, when you get approval for any new IT?  What timeframe are you looking at to get the thing done, as it were?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

that is the recommendation that he made, because they are going through quite a lot of change at the moment anyway.  The reality is that they have the least amount of work requirement placed on them.  There is no conditionality in that group and the view was that they are going to take a little longer to get used to this process and so, frankly, the others are all work related but this group is less so and is likely, therefore, to have to be handled with some care.  However, ESA, as it were, as a benefit will have closed down and new entrants will be on Universal Credit as they come in, not those who have been there for a while.  Some of those have been on for a long time, as you know.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

25,000 people are being trained at the moment in terms of claimant commitment alone.  There is a whole series of challenges, but can it be delivered?  The answer is there is no doubt in my mind. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

he had delivered Terminal 2 at Heathrow, for example—immediately, when he came in, took that and said, “I know what we have to do to make the changes and we will do more work next year”, which is what Howard Shiplee has done.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr Duncan Smith</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The whole point was the red team report, first of all, was the process of alerting us to what I had been concerned about back in 2011.  I was concerned about what we were asking and what the original plan was: whether it was deliverable in quite the frame that it was and whether they were dealing with some of the issues and problems that were arising.  I come back to the point of the difficulty being between the online solution and the security elements.  This is a very important area, because this is the first time that Government will be doing and putting such a lot accessible online.  Security was a very big issue at that stage and I think they got bogged down on that, which is why I then asked the red team report to look at it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">They came back with recommendations about what to do.  Philip Langsdale then took that report and did more work on the programme, and he was the one that made the decision and said, “We need to start the pathfinder.”  The reset had begun with the pathfinder decision, and then he said, “The next phase is to look at the equipment in detail and figure out how, then, we can roll out using the equipment as it is and whatever we do not need to use”, in essence, which is what Howard Shiplee has been doing since March.  That, however, in the meantime, was taken forward by David Pitchford, but he was looking specifically at that stage also at the digital solution, which was a new idea brought to us at that time by Digital Services.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

it is now very much at the very centre of the Department’s activity.  I am finding a lot of support and help from the Permanent Secretary in that regard as well.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond;

in other words, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">what you were trying to do becomes a dead end.  It does not work and you have to go back to square one and say, “We are going to have to look at another way to do that”.  There are a lot of man hours of work that go in to resolving something, which, sometimes, simply does not come to the conclusion you were hoping for when you set out on it.  By the way, that went on long before IT was around.  In building all sorts of things, people reach a point where this process does not work.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">This is simply costing that: that area, therefore, because it is not going to be used, because it did not work quite the way that they were anticipating, will be written off, because it is not usable on this programme.  Then you come back and say, “There is another way.  We have to try that other way to do it.”  Science is littered with this; industry is littered with this.  The nature of it is that, sometimes, some solutions in areas do not quite work as you had anticipated.  You have to rethink that process.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

font-size:12pt"> The Permanent Secretary told the Public Accounts Committee that the DWP had implemented many successful IT projects in the past.  I am not saying it is not successful but I am saying that it has turned out differently than you expected, hence the write-off.  What was the difference between this one and other projects?  Was it personnel or was it the change of senior people in the Department?  Is there a single reason or is it multiple?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Mr Duncan Smith</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There are lots of issues around this.  I think Howard Shiplee made a point earlier on when he was describing the difference between waterfall and agile.  At the early stages of this process, this was described by the team as going to be an agile process.  In actual fact, the more we proceeded down that road—hence my concerns about it in 2011—the more it began to look like a kind of hybrid.  For agile, to describe what you do, you cut up the programme development into standalone sections.  There are short bursts of work that take place.  You complete a process.  It is standalone and ready to work, and you move on to the next level.  With waterfall, you are working on everything, all the way through, until you reach the endpoint.  This had become a little bit of both by the latter stages.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I think what was different about this was the nature of just trying to bring these benefits together and also do an online ask and, as Howard Shiplee said, perhaps over-elaboration in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">terms of the “digital by default” message that was going in.  The key thing is to simplify and tidy that up, so that we are clear about what they are accessing and how they are accessing it.  What then led to problems was the complexity of the security got worse and worse, for that very simple reason, and that was the concern that we had.  I do not think there was a difference in terms of intent from the Department but I think there was a concern about the nature of the overall vision about how that was going to take place at the practical level in terms of those administrating it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">one</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> of the questions I asked was not a dissimilar one; that is why I set up the reviews to look at the utility and the quality of what had been produced.  The reports came back, as has already been stated here, that the quality of the code that had been written was of good quality and it had been well engineered.  We have had colleagues in Government Digital Services also look at the coding as well.  One also has to be realistic—and we have not mentioned scale—that, to be able to get systems analysts and the sort of technical people needed, it would be, in my view, very difficult to find, at the time, smaller suppliers.  There were a number of very large suppliers with the people, the capacity and the capability to do the work at that time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;
