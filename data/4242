Food exports are an important part of our balance of trade. However we believe it is important to ensure the correct balance between imports and home production.

Whilst this is unlikely to affect food security, as we remain a wealthy market able to compete financially with other countries for food, it does mean there are likely to be pressures on food prices. These pressures are exacerbated by the inevitability of more variable global harvests due to erratic weather as a consequence of climate change. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 19.5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 19.5pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-19.5pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">2.6 The point about growing demand for food and subsequent changing diets to meet the demands of more affluent consumers is also very relevant. An increase in the consumption of meat and dairy products due to changing diets has an influence on our prices here. Many dairy products, such as skimmed milk powder, cheese and butter, are tradable commodities and changes in the global market will influence the prices for those products in the UK, and by extension the price dairy farmers receive for their milk. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">There is less influence on highly perishable products that are difficult to trade</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">,</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> such as liquid milk, soft fruit and egg</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">s where the market is more localised to the UK.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 19.5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 19.5pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-19.5pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">2.7 Operating in a global market also has consequences for farmers, as it can be the key factor influencing the price they receive, which is independent to the cost of production. For example, a bumper global wheat harvest could mean a significant drop in the price despite the fact that costs of production in the UK may have risen. This could also be the case in dairy, where only half of our production is used for liquid milk and the remainder for products such as cheese which are susceptible to global prices. If the price of those dairy commodities drops it will influence the price paid to many dairy farmers regardless of the cost of production.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 19.5pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-19.5pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 19.5pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-19.5pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">2.8 Within their own supply chains, particularly on perishable products, retailers have constructed arrangements which provide farmers with more certainty on prices but these have tended to be those not as influenced by global prices; for example, many retailers are using a cost of production of model for their suppliers of liquid milk, recognising it is important to ensure those farmers have sufficient profit to reinvest in their business to continue to supply them in the future. However, as retailers do not buy all UK agricultural produce and have a more distant relationship with some farmers, such as cereal producers, their intervention will only benefit a proportion of UK farmers. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 19.5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 19.5pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-19.5pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">3.0</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Ensuring Food Security</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 19.5pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-19.5pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">3.1</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Improving food security is central to the business of all food retailers. Whilst Government, particularly at the EU level, can influence the policy and regulatory environment that affects food security, ultimately the responsibility for delivery of food security falls on food companies who want to continue to operate in the market in the long term.

However, the recent horsemeat incident highlighted the need to deal with attempts to deliberately defraud the system which seek to circumvent normal controls. Following this, retailers have increased their own inspections of the whole supply chain rather than relying on assurances from suppliers, and re-examined how they target testing and share intelligence. We have also encouraged the UK Government to set up a more effective mechanism for exchanging intelligence across European food authorities to identify risks more effectively. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 19.5pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-19.5pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">4.3</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Retailers recognise the importance of ensuring their supply chains adapt to climate change. They have mapped their chains to identify what climate change will mean for their current sourcing policy and planned adjustments to cope with any future shortfall in supply. They are working with suppliers to help them cope with climate change, for example facilitating the use of trickle irrigation in countries where water shortages are more likely. They have also examined the impact of increased flooding on their buildings and their distribution networks to reduce interruptions to supply in the future.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 19.5pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-19.5pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">4.4</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Through these measures retailers have helped suppliers to reduce the impact of their production, such as cutting water and energy use. It will also help suppliers be more financially resilient in the future. It is likely that water, energy and waste disposal will be more expensive in the future and improvements made today will make production more efficient and cheaper in the future. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 19.5pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-19.5pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">4.5</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Responding to the problems of sourcing in the global market retailers have collaborated to build sufficient scale to safeguard future supplies. For example, UK retailers understand the importance of using sustainable palm oil to secure a valuable resource that mitigates the risk of deforestation of primary rain forest. However, to give a sufficient market signal to producers for this type of production they have had to work with other retailers in Europe and beyond to demonstrate sufficient commercial demand. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 19.5pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-19.5pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">5.0</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">New Technology</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 19.5pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">5.1</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">We believe science and technology, as it always has, will help to improve food security. However, as we are driven by consumers, it is important that the use of technology is acceptable to them. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">5.2</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">New technology could certainly play its part in reducing waste. Nano packaging, that prolongs the shelf life of products or indicates when a product is about to exceed it, will help consumers manage food better and help prevent waste in the house. Improved forecasting and modelling will also help retailers ordering fresh produce to reduce waste at the farm level and provide reliable predictions of demand. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">5.3</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Continuing advances in agri-science will also help to increase the efficiency of farms, reduce their impact on the environment and cope with climate change. This covers everything from better utilisation of water and nutrients to changes to feed regimes that help reduce emissions and improve waste management. The key will be ensuring the dissemination of improved practices and the take up of these by farmers. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">5.4</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The use of GM is a more complex issue for UK food security. UK retailers do not currently sell GM food as there is no consumer demand. Consumers are yet to be convinced of the benefits to them of GM. The current arguments justifying the use of GM as a method for improving sustainable production are not relevant to the bulk of consumers. It remains possible, currently at least, to import dedicated non GM supplies of products to maintain this approach. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">5.5</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">GM commodities such as soya and maize are, however, key to our supply of animal feeds. They provide important sources of protein in the diet to ensure efficient production of animals. It is virtually impossible to obtain non GM soya in sufficient quantities to meet the demand in the EU. As this is imported from outside the EU, the GM soya needs to be approved for use here. As GM </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">varieties increase abroad, it is important the EU approval process keeps pace, as disruption to the import of these commodities would have significant impact on our ability to produce commercial pigs and poultry in the UK. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 19.5pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-19.5pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">6.0</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">UK Producers</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 19.5pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-19.5pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">6.1</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Our members’ supply chains are built on UK production, the vast majority of the food they sell is produced here.

Some of that investment in commissioning research to identify practical ways to reduce resource use should help farmers be more efficient and produce more for less, helping us to be self-sufficient. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 19.5pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-19.5pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">6.3</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">We also believe there are some areas where there is demand for UK production and self-sufficiency could be improved if we can find the appropriate balance between protection of the environment and new rural development. A good example is chicken production. Although virtually all fresh chicken for retailers is sourced here, there is continued interest for more, both for retailers’ processed products and from other food sectors. The problem is meeting that demand which means more development to provide increased capacity. Similarly, where producers have attempted to extend seasons by using polytunnels there have been issues in terms of the balance of development against protection for the environment. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 19.5pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-19.5pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">6.4</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">In terms of smaller UK producers, we believe there is every opportunity for them to supply major retailers. In fact, one of the factors that continues to resonate with customers is local sourcing. All major retailers have teams to identify new products for customers and they work with their suppliers to help them meet any logistical challenges. Further to this, the BRC has worked with other food bodies to establish the Safe and Local Supplier Approval (SALSA) scheme to help smaller companies meet the food safety requirements to supply a larger food company.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">9 December 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:center"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
