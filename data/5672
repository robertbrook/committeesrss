We would also contend that there are currently some serious deficiencies in access to professionally qualified careers guidance practitioners. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Y</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">ou are not expected to provide an answer to every question.

For that review we visited 60 schools and were concerned that very few of them provided good careers guidance for all their pupils. Some schools were carrying out lots of different activities, but they were not well managed. We also found that among the young people we interviewed, around 1,000 had a very narrow view of the career pathways that were available to them. In the few schools that we found were doing this well, the careers guidance service was being led strongly by the leaders of those schools. It was a top priority for them and they were prepared to invest in the service to make sure that their young people get the information they need. Overall, however, we are concerned that the advice is not broad enough and that young people do not understand the full options available to them, and we are particularly concerned about the lack of promotion of vocational training and apprenticeships. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> That is a worry </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">that </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">we share.

However, it was interesting to note that the few schools that we could see were doing this well were a complete cross-section. They were academies and schools both with and without a sixth form. Likewise, we did see a few schools with very poor careers guidance, and again there was no pattern in their being academies or schools with or without a sixth form, or in </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">their being in </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">urban or rural areas.

I should like to make clear just what the National Careers Service is here to do. The National Careers Service is a big part of the Government’s approach to the delivery of careers advice. It was established as the result of a document published in April 2012 entitled </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">The Right Advice at the Right Time</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">. The service had a specific remit, working face to face with people aged 19 and over and those who are unemployed at 18 years old, offering telephone support and website support. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The duty for sourcing independent careers advice for young people under the age of 18 lies with schools when they are in school, with local authorities when they are out of school, and with FE colleges and sixth form colleges when they are at college. The National Careers Service does not have a remit to operate specifically within schools. We offer the complementary services of the website and the helpline to assist schools in their delivery. Lots of reports over the past nine months, Ofsted being one of them, have examined how that policy is playing out. The Government are developing a number of strategies to try to encourage schools to adopt some of the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">ways, which </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Karen has alluded to</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">, </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">in which schools can work with employers to offer more inspiring opportunities for young people to understand what the world of work is like. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> We have some evidence that arrived only today </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">that </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">talks about the website.

You will be aware that a number of websites have been specifically designed to encourage people’s interest in careers. We do a lot of work on trying to improve our website in order to respond to the feedback we get from young people.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">One of the biggest obstacles we encounter is how much people know about us, but when we work with young people on the website we achieve very high approval ratings for it.

Do you think there is any merit in suggesting that perhaps there ought to be a one-stop shop for careers advice for </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> students and young people? </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Joe Billington</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: There is certainly value in having a single place to go to </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">that </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">can direct you to the best place for advice.

Admittedly it is not for young people in school but is aimed primarily at students and graduates in higher education. We have something like 2 million unique users, so we are quite a major provider of information on websites. We have discovered that, increasingly of late, more young people in school are now using our website to see what the job opportunities </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">might be </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">beyond graduation. That is quite an interesting new development. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">We are also finding that one of the problems with a lack of face-to-face support for younger people, particularly those in schools and colleges, is that it is very difficult for them to know what kind of questions they want answers to by going on to websites. Some websites, including our own, are very dense in the information they provide. While they are not particularly difficult to navigate, it is easy to miss something if you are not sure exactly how to articulate your questions. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">This is one of our concerns around the lack of guidance available to young people in schools and colleges on how to use online resources. There is therefore a tendency for some young people to approach websites in a slightly superficial way. They may not necessarily utilise </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">effectively </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">the resources that are available on the websites because they are not being prompted to do so by professionally qualified practitioners. This is really quite a major issue. Some of the best websites are excellent, and we need to try to find a way of helping young people to discern between a good website and one that has information on it that is inaccurate, not up to date or even factually incorrect. There is grave concern among some of us that a lot of material is available online </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">that </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">is actually wrong and inappropriate.

In order to tempt young people to embark on looking at websites, have you considered involving young people themselves in their design, perhaps introducing something a bit punchy so that they can say, “I have looked at this and it is terrific”? I am not being critical, but I think it is important to try </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">to </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">ensure that young people themse</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">lves can offer advice and help.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jane Artess</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: Indeed we are doing that. I can only speak on behalf of my own organisation, but we undertake a great deal of user testing. We test out with students every change that we make to the website, and we certainly try to make it as user-friendly as possible. However, as I say, our website is primarily aimed at students and graduates in higher education, so it is very information rich. I suspect—this is perhaps what my colleague has been referring to—that we may need different sorts of websites for the different sorts of individuals who use them. However, user testing is crucial and user-centred design is very much to the fore. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Joe Billington</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: We have had a similar experience, having worked very closely with young people to develop our website. The Committee will be interested to take a look a website called Plotr—it is a website so it could not be spelled normally—which is receiving some government support. It is aimed much more at the dynamic end of the spectrum. </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">W</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">e find, however, when we have conversations with young people, that there is a vast range of experience. Some young people find that dynamism quite patronising and they want more content, while others ask why it is so dry. It can be difficult. The model we are working towards, which we intend to implement over the next couple of years, is the very notion of a website that is a bit of out of date. What you really need is applications that work through other sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and so on, because that is where young people are all day long. Those sites are open to all and friends will recommend things on them. We are operating much more in that environment going forward. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> You will be glad to hear that we are going to be using Twitter </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">for the inquiry </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">this weekend. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Joe Billington</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Excellent.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q224 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lord Fearn:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> This probably follows on from the previous questions.

One of them could be access, in that young people may not have access to the internet in the home, or they may just not have the skills. However, if there is no access either at school or in the home, those skills cannot be built up. The research does not give any of the details, but access and confidence in one’s ability to understand the internet must play a substantial role. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Karen Adriaanse</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: We published a recent Ofsted report that looked at the quality of ICT in 74 secondary schools over a period of three years. We could see that only 29 of those schools, therefore fewer than half, actually had good or outstanding ICT provision. The real problem was that some of the young people, particularly those who were more able, were not being supported well enough to develop their skills and perhaps therefore lost interest. The concern was that far too many students reach the age of 16 without the sound foundation in ICT that is required for further study in related subjects. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> How many did you say?

One development in careers advice has been the increasing use of online tools for young people in place of face-to-face contact.

I think that it is a useful development. As I said earlier, we find that a lot of young people highly value the fact that they can access very detailed information online whenever they want to without having to wait for an appointment. They can research their own stuff and they know how to do it. They can find things out for themselves. In that sense it is a useful development. I think there is also another group of young people who might be able to do all that, but do not do so. They need to be given some encouragement in order to make that first click. That is the point made by the Chairman earlier: young people do not necessarily use IT for this purpose. It is not the first thing they do. The two things still need to go hand in hand. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Karen Adriaanse</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: One of the problems we found is that even among those who could use the website confidently, they did not have a mechanism for recording their ideas. There was no way they could understand where their thinking was going and then record it to discuss with someone. There was no tool for that. Certainly in our inspections we looked at records of interviews that career professionals had had with young people, and they were not always as clear as they could be. That is probably missing, whether it is an online tool or not. Something is needed to really support young people</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> as they go through the different stages of their education and training, in making their career decisions through understanding the different opportunities that are available. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> That is blatantly obvious to any of us, but the problem is that in many cases, particularly among the young unemployed we saw in </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Birmingham</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> and </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">, they do not have people to discuss these issues with.

The conclusion I am coming to is that those who come from higher social levels have less need of websites because they have contacts. Their friends and parents will help them in looking for a job and so on. The ones who really need the websites have neither the digital equipment at home nor the face-to-face contact. They are therefore blighted. How can we break the cycle because this is the one area where we can see real impoverishment both in the home situation and in where they live—and indeed even in the schools they have attended. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Joe Billington</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: I shall pick that up.

It looks for employers to offer inspiring opportunities to young people so that they can explore what the world of work is like and what a job is really like. I have with me a list of many of the jobs that people search for on our website, but the understanding of what those jobs actually are is often a long way from what they are really like. The vision wants to see direct contact between young people and employers not only in school but by taking kids out of school and bringing them into workplaces, and by offering them have-a-go opportunities to explore what job skills actually are. That kind of engagement opens young people’s eyes and may encourage them to explore the opportunity of having that important conversation about what they are going to do next.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Just as an observation, I would say that we do not help ourselves particularly when we consider the titles of some jobs.

The provision of kit is obviously crucial, but the ability to understand how to use that kit is equally important. If a computer is supplied for the home, we must make sure that parents also understand what it is for and how to use it. There is also the need to provide an internet connection and there are questions around how that will be funded. The hardware is crucial, but there are other elements</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> skills and confidence are just as important as the provision of access.

We were talking earlier about the way people make career decisions. Something I might suggest is that there is quite a large body of research and literature about how people make career decisions. Relying on putting information before people is nowadays thought of as a slightly weak approach</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> to such decision-</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">making. There is a view now that people’s career decision-making is much more complex than simply looking rationally at the situation. People’s aspirations have to be considered, along with the kind of fulfilment they might get from a job. The whole area of career decision-making is being seen to be much m</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">ore embedded within other socio</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">economic factors. For example, mention has been made </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">of</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> whether people are looking for information on websites about engineering jobs. Current research literature suggests that young people in particular have a very limited range of ideas from which they choose. They do not choose from all the possible opportunities available to them, but from those things that seem to be appropriate to “people like me”. Those whose parents and backgrounds include experience of higher education, for example, will be more likely to see higher education and entering the professions as a route forward than people whose parents do not have such experiences. What I suppose I am really suggesting is that we need to broaden our thinking beyond simply considering what must be done to help people find information. It is much more complex and rich than that. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Surely it is an exercise in self development. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jane Artess</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: There is quite a lot of material available. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> As you are all experts, can you come up with your ideal plans for what you would like to see being done differently than is the case at the moment?

As part of our survey of 60 schools, we also produced an online survey for parents, to which we had 1,700 responses. Of those, 70% wanted their children to go to university on the A-level route. It might be that they were the parents who could access a computer, but even so, it is a very high proportion. Certainly when talking to young people, their parents and teachers, it is clear that vocational training and apprenticeships are not fully understood. They are seen as a second option. For Ofsted it has become a very high priority to promote the vocational route as an equal route to the academic one. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> You mentioned 70% of parents, but how many of the children wanted the same thing?

Those who felt that they were not able to take the university route felt that they were failing. The most important gap is the promotion of vocational training and employment at level 2, which is the equivalent of a GCSE, and thus not going up to the A-level route. People can then go into jobs and into training as a positive progression and as an achievement. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lord Cotter:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> That information is of great concern. I am a little surprised because I had hoped that the situation was changing. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Joe Billington</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: Perhaps I can offer the Committee some encouragement on that front. What Karen has said is right, but it is worth being aware of the change that is going on and perhaps putting our shoulder to that wheel. We have seen a doubling in the number of apprentices in the country over the past four years. There were </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">240,000 in</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> 2008-09, while 500,000 apprenticeships started last year, which reflects a big growth. There has also been a big growth in the number of employers who want apprentices. Indeed, we have seen a 27% increase just in the last year. Employer demand for apprentices is the key element. That is what will drive up the status of apprenticeships and the status of vocational routes to learning. That will deal with the problem. It is all about demand. If the demand is constantly for graduates, university will continue to be the main route. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Karen Adriaanse</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: I agree absolutely that there are now more apprentices, and last year we noted that a 63% increase of applicants who were under the age of 19</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> that is, applications made by 16 to 18 year-olds. More young people applied last year because they wanted to do apprenticeships, but only 23% were successful. There is a better chance of becoming an apprentice if you are aged 19 or 24-plus. Our concern is for the younger age groups because they do not have the opportunity to join apprenticeships—often because they do not have employability skills. Employers themselves will deem that at that age they are not employable, so that it is why it is really important that schools develop such skills. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Do you think that through these young people, who are now obviously rallying to the call for more apprentices, apprenticeships are commanding more respect? That </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">is </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">missing for this group. They might pretend behind a mask of bravado, but deep down they do not </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">have </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">much self-confidence or self-respect. Do you feel that this could be a win-win situation, where if people take up apprenticeships those around them will think that they are on the right road? </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Joe Billington</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: The Skills Funding Agency includes the National Apprenticeship Service, which has gathered a lot of evidence and case studies of highly admirable individuals who have been through apprenticeships and are now acting as advocates for apprenticeships. That happens a lot. We are promoting young people going into schools to talk about apprenticeships and that route to success. So it is happening, but Karen’s point is valid in that it is still only happening in a fairly small way. My feeling is that this is a burgeoning development and that it is growing all the time</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">. People such as you</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> can help with that by continuing to push the apprenticeships route. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> We have enough to do without going into schools, I am afraid. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Baroness Valentine:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> I am not sure that I have understood exactly what Karen has just said. I recognise that employers might say that 16 to 18 year-olds do not have employability skills if they come in as apprentices. Are you saying that they should therefore stay on at school or go to sixth-form college until they are sufficiently confident to move into the workplace, or are you saying that employers should deal with them more while they are in that phase? </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Karen Adriaanse</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: I think ideally we would expect schools to promote employability skills in young people so that when they reach the age of 16 they are more employment ready. We know that the FE sector is providing better training in employability skills, so that young people going into FE can develop these skills more quickly. That enables them to become more employable and secure an apprenticeship. That is also what the traineeship programme is doing. However, it is certainly also the case that employers have a large role to play as well in being able to identify what it is that they are looking for in young people, and </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">in </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">making sure that schools and the FE sector understand what those requirements are. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Baroness Valentine:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> On the point about employability skills, at the age of 16, even if you have been very well trained, a lot of people are still quite immature</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> whatever is done. Certainly when listening to FE colleges and businesses talking about this issue, the conclusion I take from </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">them</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> is that trying to put young people into full-time apprenticeships where they are expected to contribute is not a productive way of working with 16 year-olds</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">, </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">however well they have been trained up to that point. They still need a bit more time to grow up in the same sense as people going to university are given time to grow up. That is particularly the case if they are the third generation to be out of work or whatever. I am not clear whether you are advocating employers taking o</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">n such people at the age of 16.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Karen Adriaanse</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: If young people have basic employability skills, it is a very good idea. They can be provided with training and they will progress. If they do not have those skills, it is up to schools and the FE sector to work with employers to find out what they need so that young people can progress into employment more quickly. That is better than completing a long-term course </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">that </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">might not lead to any employment. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> There are some enlightened employers who give young people a day off each week so that they can improve their literacy and communication skills. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lord Clinton-Davis:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Can you give us some idea of the issues raised in the debate about this matter?

Could you comment on the value of EU funding in this area</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">? Ha</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">s it been well used and has it added value? We are particularly interested in the European interventions. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Joe Billington</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: Shall I start off on this one by talking about the National Careers Service? I alluded earlier to the fact that we spend around £8 million worth of European funding every year on our face-to-face service. The service was launched in 2012, but it had a predecessor called Next Step, which was the adult side of careers advice and guidance prior to the National Careers Service coming in. European funds were first introduced to careers advice and guidance in 2008 as part of the response to the economic downturn at the time. What was then the Learning and Skills Council was running a programme called </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Response to Redundancy</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">, and that was where lots of European Social Fund money was used. It extended the Next Step offer to people who were not at that time in the priority group. It was formed of people who were in work and doing quite well, but because of the economic downturn many of them were facing redundancy. At the time we added to our list of priority groups a new section comprised of those who were at risk of or facing redundancy. For the past six years the section has remained part of our priority group. Lots of our European funding is focused on ensuring that people who face particular barriers to entering employment are given additional support by the National Careers Service. The European Social Fund has focused on that area and now around 70% of our delivery is made to people in the priority group. Taken together it is broader than the redundancy group. It extends to young people between the ages of 18 and 24 who are not in education, employment or training, people with learning difficulties and disabilities, and ex offenders. There is a list of the priority groups, and that is where the European Social Fund has had its impact. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q229 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Earl of </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> In previous sessions we have heard evidence </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">that </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">suggests that one of the biggest areas where there are skills gaps and therefore potentially jobs for young people is that of ICT. What do you think prevents young people coming forward into this area, and what could be d</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">one to encourage more to do so?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Clive Richardson</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: I will start off on this one. I want to make two points by way of context. The first is the size of the digital economy and its importance to the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">. The digital economy accounts for over 8% of UK GDP. It is larger than the construction sector and the education sector. Some 2 million jobs in the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> are due to business activity delivered through digital technology. The mobile operator 02 has forecast that in the period up to 2017 there could be up to 750,000 more jobs in the UK that require digital skills. It is quite a big deal at the m</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">oment and it is growing.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The other point of context is the diversity of what we mean when we refer to ICT. A career as a video game designer is very different from a career working in data security in the financial services industry, which in turn is very different from working in digital advertising. Those three careers all need high-end ICT skills, but in very different contexts. ICT is a limiting description for what embraces a very rich environment of information, but one thing that we can be confident of is the fact that in the future all jobs will require some form of basic digital skill. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">I shall go back to the question. I am not sure that it is just about encouraging people to take up these opportunities because skills gaps exist. In </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Ireland</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> there are currently some 4,500 vacancies in the IT sector</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> which cannot be filled. Half of all the IT jobs in </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Dublin</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> have been taken by foreign-born workers because employers cannot get sufficient numbers of people with the skills to fill those vacancies. In the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">, the proportion of 16 to 29 year-olds working in the IT sector over the past decade has declined from 32% to 19%. Why is that? Employers report skills gaps, which goes back to the point about employability skills. While you need to have technical skills, you also need the softer communication, creativity and entrepreneurship skills. It is more about a bundle of skills. Young people leaving school or university often do not have the full complement of skills that employers tend to look for. Another statistic to underline this is the fact that the unemployment rate for IT graduates in 2010 was the highest for all degree courses. There is an issue about making sure that employers are given the opportunity to help feed into course design to make sure that the skills which young people are being taught are actually what employers want, especially in the digital area where the scene changes extremely rapidly. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Earl of </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Thank you for such a comprehensive answer. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Do you see a role for EU funds in this area? </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Clive Richardson</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: There could well be. One of the short-term solutions is to retrain people who have latent digital skills to give them the full package with business input. Some form of matching young people who are unemployed with employers, including SMEs that require digital skills, would be a useful way of trying to address the shortfall. Some funding could be provided. There is a range of companies which deliver digital skills, some of which I am aware of. They are called Free:Formers, Fluency and Codeacademy. They provide kids with digital skills and then put them into positions </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">that </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">are not just in high-end IT</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">; t</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">hey could go into digital marketing or advertising.

Some funding could be used for this kind of short-term training of young unemployed people with the input of employers who need certain skills. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Mr Billington, you get funds from the EU, do you not?

It might be of interest to the Committee to know that of those who have studied software engineering or computer science at university, around two-thirds take up positions as what might loosely be called IT professionals, although that certainly covers a wide range of jobs. What is also interesting to note is that when we look at these destination figures, we realise that people who have studied other subjects are in the same position. For example, around 15% of those who have studied physics also progress into ICT-related jobs. It suggests that the sector is amenable to lots of different subject disciplines, certainly at the higher level, but I would guess at other levels as well. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> That is a real inspiration for young people who do not have jobs at the moment.

It is interesting to note that what is missing is young people’s understanding that these schemes can lead to higher education courses and professional qualifications as well. Again, as I said earlier, many of the young people we interviewed had a very narrow view of what apprenticeships are and did not realise their potential. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">I have already talked about our concerns around the r</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">ecruitment of young people into </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">apprenticeships, but we are also concerned that in many areas the quality is still not good enough.

Do you think that young people are aware of the EU-operated EURES online system to promote this sort of mobility? How effective is it, and are there better ways in which ICT could be used? </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jane Artess</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: I suspect that young people are not that aware of EURES. My sense of this, in a purely professional sense because I have no hard and fast evidence, would suggest that encouraging young people in the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> to think about being geographically mobile is difficult. In some areas it is difficult to encourage young people to think about applying for opportunities in the neighbouring town, let alone in a neighbouring country. There are some very complex social and cultural norms around how people see their travel-to-work opportunities. We often hear that it is also about a lack of competence in the learning of other languages. I do not know whether that is the case, but intuitively I feel that it sounds plausible. That leads me to think that older and more experienced young people, those who already have experience of holding down a job, might be more amenable to thinking about their mobility. When thinking about this question, I was mindful of whether we do enough with employers and businesses </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">that </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">are transnational companies. Does the structuring of work placements and induction programmes include engagement in other countries, both European countries and maybe wider than that? That might be very useful. However, I suspect that one would have to start up such initiatives very much lower down in school so that it then becomes a possibility rather than something that is remote and detached. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> It is a real shame because there are opportunities for young people to go abroad for work, particularly when they do not have too much baggage. Doing so opens up good opportunities for them. Other nations are much more mobile, but the point is that we feel great because we speak English. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Clive Richardson</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: I am not sure that EURES does a hugely successful job of promoting the idea of mobility on its website. It looks to be a function where you match CVs with employers who have vacancies, but it does not promote the idea that someone might want to go abroad to work. I know that it is being redesigned, because I was looking at it just yesterday, but I think that someone might learn more about what it is like to work in a different country by watching a two-minute video rather than reading through reams of text on the EURES website. I would suggest that the EU should itself do some user testing to make sure that what it is delivering is actually what young people find useful and interesting. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Joe Billington</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: We have a link to EURES from the National Careers Service website. There may be some very limited statistics on how many people have visited that page which I might be able to find. I do not imagine that the number will be very high. The NCS website is quite large and there is a lot of stuff to look at. You have to go in a long way to find the EURES bit. However, I agree with what Mr Richardson has just said: this reflects our conversation earlier about how the NCS and other websites need to learn about how people interact with IT. It seems that EURES needs to look a little more closely at its website. Going to a website in order to find out about working overseas is not actually the way in which people engage. We need to look more into social media engagement. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q232 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lord Clinton-Davis:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Perhaps I can ask the last question, which flows directly from what you have been saying. People, and young people in particular, are loath to go abroad. Could something be done to encourage such pathways to be followed? </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Karen Adriaanse</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: As has already been mentioned, language learning in this country is seen as a subject in itself rather than as a marketable asset for those who want to do vocational training and move abroad. It is certainly something that needs to be better promoted in schools because it is a means of progressing to other vocational training. When we think of the range of jobs and career pathways that are available to linguists per se, they are not many, but actually those who can speak two or more languages really do have a strong asset that will support them. That is not</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> promoted in schools very well.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Lord Clinton-Davis:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Do schools, when they take pupils abroad on school trips, encourage that experience to be followed up?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Karen Adriaanse</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: There are lots of projects around exchanges, but many of them are not well enough linked to businesses and other vocational opportunities. Again, they are seen as something to help young people learn a language, but there is not enough to help them develop their own career ideas. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> The point was made earlier about companies </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">that </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">are really big over here and are probably based in the </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> but which have huge international reach. There might be some merit in schools and universities approaching them—not from the Committee’s point of view—saying that they have young people with talents that can enhance their businesses if they are employed. They will go abroad and come back, particularly when they are young. I know there is always a danger that when employers send someone abroad, they think that they will never get them back because they will be poached by someone else, but that is a risk you have to take. It certainly seems a bit sanguine on the part of the British not to do it. I come from a country where we are always looking at the emigrant ship. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Thank you all very much indeed for what has been an extremely worthwhile session. I am going to ask each of you to come up with a question that we should have asked but did not ask, and what the answer to that question is. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jane Artess</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: That is a good one. My major concern is to do with the kind of support structures </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">that </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">we are putting into place. We talk a lot about the lack of career guidance available to young people and I do not want to rehearse the arguments we have already heard. However, there are many different ways in which young people can be supported in their career progression. Let us just take the example of encouraging young people to be more mobile. We need to put in place the support structures that will allow people to feed confident that those are the kinds of moves they can make. Sometimes, with the emphasis on skills</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">,</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> employability and qualifications, we can miss some of the softer things around providing young people with mentors or buddies working in friendlier environments in which the art of the possible can become apparent to them. That is something that we need to think about. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Joe Billington</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: I am very interested in the role and function of cultural role models in this arena. We are conscious of the research </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">that </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">has been done recently showing that the careers young people expect to go into are very different from the careers that the economy expects there to be. There is a big mismatch here. Although it is mostly speculation, a certain amount of research has been done into the cause of that, and I have with me some anecdotes which I think are fairly instructive. A conference was held last week called Inspiring Women. It was all about women and the economy, and no doubt the Committee heard about it because the Deputy Prime Minister’s wife was there. One of the questions being put by young women to the National Careers Service people at the conference was about midwifery. I am not sure that 10 years ago you would have found many young women asking about midwifery, but now there is a programme on the telly. Thirty years ago, when I was thinking about a career and some of my colleagues were careers advisers, lots of young women were asking about becoming motor mechanics. Again, you would not expect young women to ask about this career path, but at the time Kylie Minogue was a motor mechanic on “Neighbours”. It is worth spending a little time thinking about cultural role models and what they can do. The number of people who expect to work in the media and expect to make it by winning a talent contest is quite high, while planning for what the economy wants is quite low. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">The Chairman:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> What about the dancers?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Joe Billington</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: I really do not think that I am going to make it as a dancer; I am past that point. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Karen Adriaanse</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: Very much building on what has just been said, what is missing is good information about skills shortages, where developments are taking place, and then promoting them. It follows </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">on </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">exactly </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">from </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">what Mr Billington has been saying. It is all very well for people to be inspired to do something, but there is no point if there are no jobs in that area. That is why there is a call to the LEPs to work so as to make sure that more information directly from businesses is made available in schools and to training providers to ensure that the training provision really is producing the skills that are required in the economy. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q233 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Earl of </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">:</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Do you think there is a role for Facebook and Twitter in all this? I do not use either of them so I do not know. This question comes slightly out of the left field, but it occurs to me that if we want to reach young people, they are all on these social network sites. I am not sure I would go as far as wanting to see mentors on the Facebook site, but do you think there is a role for Facebook and Twitter in helping the young </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">to find employment?</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Karen Adriaanse</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: I think that this is already happening, but only on a very small scale. When we find it working well on our inspection visits, it is certainly something that we will be able to promote as good practice. It is an area that we are looking at. </span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:200%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Jane Artess</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">: It is already happening quite a lot in higher education.
