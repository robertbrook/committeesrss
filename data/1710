WiSET is based within the Centre for Science education (CSE) at Sheffield Hallam University. We are a longstanding and </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">experienced academic and practitioner team working in the field relating to gender, STEM and education along the whole pipeline.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">2. The 'leaky pipeline' phenomena is a useful way of identifying pressure points at which to address the shortfall of girls and</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> women taking up and progressing in STEM. But the under-representation of women at higher levels of academia is part of a wider societal problem. The STEM sector has a number of specific issues relating to women</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> that are longstanding and complex.
