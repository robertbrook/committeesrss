VCJD differs from CJD as it is distributed more widely through the body, and is present outside the nervous system, affecting the organs, unlike CJD. The average age of death of patients with CJD in the United States is 78, whilst the average age of death in the UK due to </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> is 30. This highlights the severity of this disease, and more concerning as this is a relatively new disease, first reported in 1996, there is little known about the disease.</span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 31.25pt; padding-left:4.75pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">172 cases of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> have been reported in the UK, which is over triple the amount of cases found in the rest of the world. This is thought to be due to the exposure to cattle infected with ‘mad cow’ disease. This shows the importance of the inquiry in the UK Parliament, as currently Britain is country most at risk from this deadly disease. At present, there have been three cases in the UK that show transmission through blood transfers. Further evidence has found that organ and tissue donation could have similar effects as unlike CJD, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> can affect organs and tissue. </span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 31.25pt; padding-left:4.75pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Variant CJD and its threat to the UK were debated by the Science and Technology Committee less than a month before the inquiry into screening for </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> was opened. This shows that the topic is of importance within government due to the intensity of discussion in committees on the disease. There has been much research to try and find an accurate screening test for the disease. Recently, scientists from the Medical Research Council in England developed a test in 2011 which was 71% accurate, showing that screening could save lives. There has been exposure in the media in relation to </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, due to concerning research published in the British Medical Journal which showcased the possibility of one in two thousand people being carriers of the disease. Articles from the Independent and BBC News outline growing concerns over the prevalence of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> and the impact it could have on individuals and society. The inquiry follows the governments ‘Taking Organ Donation to 2020’ Strategy which sets out aspirations of increasing blood, tissue and organ donation to above 80% of the population. This is highly relevant as the case of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> illustrates concerns over the safety of the current supply of donations and the risks to those who receive transplants and transfusions. </span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 31.25pt; padding-left:4.75pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Due to this evidence, the Science and Technology Committee are launching an inquiry into whether screening for </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> is necessary on components for transplants. As there is little known about the disease, some public health advisors believe that until sufficient research is carried out, screening should not be enforced at such an early stage. It is also important to note that the disease is becoming even rarer with only 2 diagnosed cases each year since </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> peaked in 2000 with 28 deaths. This shows that the disease currently is of little threat, even in the United Kingdom. On the other hand, there is a strong case to argue that screening for </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> is a vital step for transfusions.  The basis of the argument centres on the severity of the disease itself. VCJD is incurable and fatal, which offers a strong argument in favour of screening for </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, which would prevent the transfer of the disease through blood, tissue and organ donation. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-variant:small-caps">Submission of evidence</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Has the threat of ongoing transmission of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> through the blood and blood product supply been adequately mitigated?</span></p><ol start="8" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 31.25pt; padding-left:4.75pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The simple and direct answer to the question raised is no. The reason the question of whether the transmission of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> through blood product supply is being adequately mitigated is of high importance over other issues the committee has raised, is due to the strong grounds to believe that the government are not prioritising the concerns raised by the public and media over such a destructive and dangerous disease. Should the blood product supply already be contaminated by </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, which there is strong reason to believe, the effects on society are astronomical. Although the UK Blood Services has regulations in place to restrict blood donation from people who are known to have </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, as this disease can remain silent and incubate for many years, there is a risk of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> going unnoticed in the blood product supply. This is extremely risky as those who are vulnerable and in severe need of a blood transfusion are those who are susceptible to acquiring the fatal disease.  The UK Blood Service and the government have not done enough to protect people who have ultimate trust in their services and consequently putting them in unnecessary and horrendous situations. </span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 31.25pt; padding-left:4.75pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">So far the government has refused to further fund the trial of a 71% accurate test to identify </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> in people, developed by the Medical Research Council </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Prion</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> Unit. Former Health Secretary Dobson describes how despite spending £540 million creating and funding the unit to provide a screening process, the government still is not allowing the possibility of the test to save lives, in an article for the Guardian in 2011. This illustrates that not enough has been done to deal with </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> as the government is seemingly ignoring the ongoing threat of the disease. By preventing the further research into a test for </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, the consequent risk is that more people may be infected with </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> through blood transfusions whilst delays continue.</span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Although the threat of acquiring </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> through blood and organ transfusions is extremely rare, with only three cases in the UK reported, the consequences of there being a </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> outbreak in the United Kingdom’s blood product supply is dire. It is most prevalent in Britain, which creates argument to try to combat the disease. The 2004 report from the Canadian panel on screening blood transfers for </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> offers an assumption made by the panel that such a test would be of higher priority to the UK due to its prevalence. Also, the report argues that it is most likely that screening would be initiated in countries where there is more access to </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> patients. This highlights how the government have not adequately dealt with the threat as currently there is no screening in place which could cause the further spread of the incurable disease, showing that more could and should be done to combat the risk. There has been failure in dealing with the ongoing risk of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> transfer as it remains an ongoing risk. Pearson, writing in the International Weekly Journal of Science, explains that estimates of the incubation period of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> differ from ten years to fifty years. This highlights how there is confusion over how long a person may develop symptoms after acquiring the disease, meaning, worryingly, that a person may donate blood without knowing if they are carrying the disease. The storage date for red blood cells is 42 days and for plasma is up to 12 months, meaning that the disease, most likely, will not be detected within this period and instead may be donated for blood transfusions. This is extremely dangerous as the blood product supply could unknowingly be harbouring the disease.</span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">The World Health Organisation (WHO) describes the severe symptoms of the incurable disease, including anxiety, depression and painful and persistent sensory systems. As the disease develops, it can leave patients immobile and mute before death. It is the duty of the government and the UK Blood Services to ensure that the patients awaiting blood, tissue and organ transplants are protected as much as possible. By not screening donators for </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, the government is placing patients at avoidable risk. Despite </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> being extremely uncommon, there is possibility that we may only be seeing the start of an infectious disease form as the disease is new and little is known about it. The British Medical Journal suggests that one in every two thousand people could be silent carriers of the disease, which also illustrates that while the disease has been in decline since 2000, there is possibility that </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> could still be spread through transfusions. The threat of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> has not been eradicated, therefore more measures should be put in place to try and prevent the disease from going unnoticed and resulting in an epidemic. Although a large resurgence of the disease may seem unlikely, it is of high importance that everything that can be done to prevent this situation is being done. Therefore, detection of the disease is a necessary step in trying to eradicate the disease, or at least minimising the transfer of the disease through blood transfusions. </span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Currently there are regulations in the United Kingdom as to who can qualify to be a blood, tissue or organ donor. Public Health advice was given to patients who had received blood or tissue transfers in 2004, stating that they should not donate blood, tissue or organs due to the increased chances of spreading </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> should they be carrying the disease. Regulations presently restrict those who have had a blood, plasma or tissue transfusion since the beginning of 1980 from donating and the exclusion of blood donors who blood was transfused and the recipient latter developed </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. These regulations clearly protect people by preventing the disease from being spread once it has been detected in the blood product supply. Yet it is only when the disease has been discovered by a recipient of blood, plasma or tissue, when preventative action is taken. This seems questionable as people who have already received </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> infected donations may be dissatisfied that preventative methods were not in place before hand. </span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Concerning figures have been presented by the National Blood Service, showing that eighteen donors, who suffered </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, have had their components issued to sixty seven recipients. This highlights how donations can be spread vastly and how there is little, if anything, that can be done should all sixty seven recipients later develop </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. It does not appear to be ethical or </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">moral to disregard the patients who were infected with </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> when it could be prevented through screening for the disease before donations are made. The threat of ongoing transmission of the disease has not be dealt with sufficiently, as the UK Blood Service has failed to acknowledge and act on evidence which shows the disease can remain silent for up to fifty years. Screening is a necessary step to protect present and future patients. Detection of the disease before donation can prevent the UK blood product supply from being infected as well as protecting the reputation and the protection of the service.</span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">If death and the spread of an incurable and fatal disease is preventable, then screening should undeniably take place. It is a necessary step as it could prevent death and the further spread of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. Rather than removing donations of blood which has been found to be infected through a recipient developing </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, it should be the priority to ensure that </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> is not in the blood product supply at all.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-variant:small-caps">Reflective account</span></p><ol start="15" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">When choosing which committee inquiry to submit evidence to, I struggled to find an inquiry which I had sufficient knowledge and interest in. For instance, the majority of inquiries were complex and only applied to one specific policy area, which suggested specialist knowledge was needed. I choose the Science and Technology inquiry into screening blood, tissue and organs for </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> because I have a keen interest in the politics of health and in what ways the government are responsible for ensuring the health of their citizens. Although I had a limited knowledge about the disease and blood, tissue and organ donations, I was keen to learn more about the issue.</span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">To research the topic, I began by looking at the Committees previous inquiry into </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, and gathered some information from evidence submitted to that inquiry. I also wanted to look at the recent research on the disease, to discover more about the disease, who it affects, symptoms, where it is most prevalent, how it differs from traditional CJD, etc. To form my written submission, it was integral to find out more about what options the government has in terms of screening and whether this is a feasible solution to the threat of variant CJD. I found it easy to find information on the disease, yet I struggled to find professional opinion on what the government should be doing to reduce the risk. Newspaper articles generally criticised the government for not acting to save lives, yet offered no real solution. This made it essential for me to gather as much information as possible to form my own opinion and offer my own advice.</span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">I found the inquiry page easy to understand and feel like it gave clear instructions as to what the government wanted to look into and assess in terms of screening for </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">. However, I feel that the questions outlined on the page were somewhat off topic to the issue the inquiry was investigating. For example, one of the questions posed asked whether the ‘Taking Organ Donation to 2020’ government scheme, was adequate at promoting organ donation. This was confusing as it did not specifically focus on the issue of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">, which has only been transferred through blood transfusions so far. Therefore, I chose to address the question that I felt dealt most with the possibility of reducing the threat of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> transfusion. My submission focused on what the government had failed to do, in respect to the lack of immediacy to combat the risk of </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">vCJD</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt"> further infecting the UK blood product supply. I also believed it was </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">essential to promote the use of screening on current and future blood products, and argued throughout that the government can be seen to be ignorant to the real threat of the disease.</span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">In my submission, I found it extremely difficult to balance between breadth and depth as I felt it was important to convey the possible consequences of ignoring the disease. Consequently, I chose to focus on depth, by raising few of what I felt to be the most pressing issues but using research and evidence to support my arguments. By already having a basis of knowledge on health security, I was able to offer an opinion on how the government can be seen to be failing to protect its citizens by placing those most vulnerable by needing a blood, organ or tissue transplant at unnecessary risk. I have criticised the governments laid back approach to the possible risk of an epidemic caused by a contaminated blood product supply. I also found that I offered a liberal approach to the discussion, as the argument I posed focused on the protection of human rights of all individuals in the UK, especially ensuring that people have the information on the risks of blood and organ transfers to make an informed choice. </span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Through this assessment, I have learnt how to communicate my opinion in a direct and persuasive way, by using evidence and text to first shape my opinion and then support it. I have also discovered how to research an issue I know very little about, without much direction. Throughout this process, I have learnt a lot about a disease I have not come across before and a specific policy area that there is much debate over. I feel confident that with use of my skills and my increased knowledge into VCJD and the UK Blood Service, I have been able to form a </span></li><li style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">I was surprised how easy it is to access committees and shape discussion within parliament through submissions of evidence. It is of a great advantage to committees that they are able to receive specialist and professional opinion on issues brought up by inquiries, especially as they have knowledge which may not be present in the committee itself. Yet the system works both ways. Through participatory democracy, the public are able to access parliament and get involved in issues they feel passionate or have interest in. If this access route was not available, and I wanted to offer my opinion on something I felt strongly about, I would try to reach out to a member of the committee and try to persuade them to take a similar stance to my own. However, this would not be as effective as reaching out to all MPs through written submissions as MPs are approached frequently about a number of concerns from the public, some of which may be of more interest to them. Consequently, it is important that both committees and the general public make use of the access routes available to them. The experience tells me that submissions of evidence are extremely important to MPs as it is a quick and easy way for them to learn more about the topic under discussion.  It also tells me that submissions of evidence can shape debate and discussion within committees as they often raise issues and voice opinions which may not be found by the committee alone.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">December 2013</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
