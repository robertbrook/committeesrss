On the contrary, the experience of DLA members suggests that tribunal recommendations, which are intended to assist employers to adopt improved equality practices and thus to avoid future litigation, are often welcomed by employers.  In this brief submission the DLA seeks to assist MPs and Peers to understand what this power of employment tribunals involves and why it should be retained.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt;

Many of the provisions of earlier legislation were reproduced in the 2010 Act, but the 2010 Act also simplified some provisions and filled gaps which had been identified during lengthy consultation. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="5" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Under all of the previous enactments prohibiting discrimination in the workplace, if an employment tribunal found an employer liable of discrimination the tribunal could make a recommendation that that employer take steps to protect the complainant from a reoccurrence of similar or identical treatment. However, it had long been clear that discrimination in the workplace often resulted in a breakdown of the relationship between the employer and the employee, and by the time of the employment tribunal hearing many complainants were no longer employed by respondent employers. In such cases the tribunal would have no power to recommend that an employer take any steps to prevent discrimination in the future.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="6" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 32pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The Equality Act 2010 in s.124 has filled this gap by enabling employment tribunals, after a finding of discrimination, to make a recommendation which it considers appropriate to protect the complainant and/or other current or future employees of </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">the respondent employer. A recommendation that is intended to go beyond protection of the complainant her/himself has come to be known as a ‘wider recommendation’.  So far as the DLA is aware, permitting wider recommendations was not opposed at any stage during the parliamentary consideration of the Equality Act. Since October 2010 employment tribunals have used this power where, after a finding of discrimination, they have identified practicable steps which they consider appropriate for respondent employers to take. Most frequently tribunals recommend training of managers on relevant  equality practice; other recommendations have included circulation of the tribunal’s judgment amongst senior management, adoption of equal opportunity and “zero tolerance” of discrimination or harassment policies, review of grievance and disciplinary procedures, monitoring workforce processes (see case examples below).</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="7" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 5pt 32pt; padding-left:4pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Employment tribunals are independent judicial bodies that determine disputes between workers and employers. Every employment tribunal is chaired by an employment judge, a legally qualified person with relevant experience, appointed by the Judicial Appointments Commission. When an employment tribunal hears a complaint under the Equality Act the employment judge sits with two lay members who </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">have practical experience in employment relations:  one person with experience on the employers' side (for example as a personnel director) and one person with experience on the employees' side (for example as a trade union officer).

It also ensures that the tribunal can recommend that the employer take wider steps to ensure the treatment is not repeated, even if this does not affect the individual who brought the claim. For example, in a case of pregnancy discrimination, it may be that by the time her case is heard the woman has had her baby and returned to work , and so a recommendation that managers should have training on Equality Act provisions relating to pregnancy would not be of particular benefit to her;. </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">however</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> such a recommendation would be beneficial to other employees who are pregnant in the future, and beneficial to the employer in avoiding further complaints or litigation.

If the tribunal upholds the Equality Act complaint it will then go on to consider remedies. It is open to the tribunal to invite the parties to make representations as to suitable remedies which the tribunal could order, including recommendations.

In considering whether a recommendation would be appropriate and what  steps will be practicable for the employer, the tribunal is able to refer to all of the evidence regarding the employer, including its size, structure, management arrangements, nature of the work, etc. as well as the evidence relating to the incidence of discrimination, harassment and/or victimisation. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="14" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The experience of the lay members of the tribunal, and in particular the lay member with experience from the employers’ side, will be invaluable in assessing what recommendation, if any, would be appropriate and practicable.  As the Employment Appeal Tribunal held, "[</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">i</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">]t would not be proper for a Tribunal to make a recommendation the carrying out of which was from the point of view of the discriminator completely impracticable”.</span><a name="_ftnref1"></a><a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="15" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 5pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">It is the DLA’s understanding that in most cases where an employment tribunal decides to make a recommendation under s.124 this is on their own initiative. Most complainants and their advisers or advocates refer to remedies only in terms of the tribunal’s power to award monetary compensation. Increasingly complainants are unrepresented, and most are not even aware of the tribunal’s powers to make recommendations. The DLA is not aware of data showing the proportion of successful cases in which recommendations are made; it is the impression of the DLA that this continues to be a very small proportion.  </span></li></ol><p style="margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; text-decoration:underline">Clause 2</span></p><ol start="16" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:5pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Clause 2 in the draft Deregulation Bill would remove the powers of employment tribunals to make wider recommendations in Equality Act proceedings by amendment of s.124 of that Act.  </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="17" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The DLA strongly recommends that Clause 2 should not remain part of the Bill.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="18" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Parliament should not be asked to remove the discretionary power which Parliament had recently given to employment tribunals to make appropriate recommendations to assist employers to remove or reduce the effects on their workforce of their proven unlawful acts.  Section 124 of the Equality Act makes it possible for an employment tribunal, an independent judicial body, to make a recommendation; whether it does so is a decision of the members of the tribunal, including the lay member chosen for their experience to represent employers’ interests.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="19" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The Government’s decision to introduce Clause 2 was made at the conclusion of a consultation process in 2012 when the Government acknowledged that “there is no evidence to suggest that the wider recommendations made so far are disproportionate or ineffective”.</span><a name="_ftnref2"></a><a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">  Of the recommendations of which the Government was aware at that time which related to improving an employer’s HR practices or providing equality training to staff, the Government’s view was that “these are basic remedial actions which we would expect most employers at the sharp end of a tribunal finding to undertake in any event”.</span><a name="_ftnref3"></a><a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Without evidence of </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">disproportionality</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> and with recommendations consistent with what employers found to discriminate should themselves be undertaking, the sole basis for the introduction of Clause 2 would appear to be the Government’s “objection to the regulatory and prescriptive approach of trying to provide for [this]…in legislation”.</span><a name="_ftnref4"></a><a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> Clause 2 would leave intact the employment tribunal’s statutory power to make recommendations to benefit only the complainant which has been provided for in legislation since 1975. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="20" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The DLA challenges the rationale of the proposed line being drawn in the powers of an employment tribunal based not on evidence relating to the respondent employer but whether the complainant is still employed by that employer. The remedies and sanctions available to an independent judicial body following a finding of a breach of the Equality Act should not depend on the arbitrary fact of whether the complainant </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">is employed at the time of its decision. When the complainant remains employed by the respondent so that a recommendation is to reduce the adverse effect of the discrimination on the complainant, the Act provides a means of enforcement in </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">s.124(</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">7).  If the respondent has unreasonably failed to comply with an appropriate recommendation the complainant may go back to the tribunal, and the tribunal may increase the compensation it had ordered the respondent to pay or make an order for compensation. However, it is important to note that even in such cases the Act does not provide a means to force the employer to comply with the recommendation; it merely provides for a further payment of compensation to the complainant if the employer decides not to heed the tribunal’s remedy decision. This does not mean a recommendation is non-binding, it is just a different mechanism of enforcement (for the vast majority of breach of contract claims the remedy of specific performance is not available, but this does not mean that those contracts are “non-binding”).</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="21" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; line-height:108%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The DLA does not agree with the Government that the lack of a statutory enforcement mechanism for a wider recommendation is a ground to remove tribunals’ power to make wider recommendations.
