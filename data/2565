We do this by identifying and promoting the best practices, tools and methods in the field of online safety and privacy that also respect free speech. FOSI convenes leaders in industry, government and the non-profit sectors to collaborate and innovate new solutions and policies in the field of online safety. Through research, resources, events and special projects, FOSI promotes a culture of responsibility online and encourages a sense of digital citizenship for all. With roundtables, forums and conferences around the globe, FOSI plays an important role in driving the international debate.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="3" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 13.25pt; padding-left:4.75pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">FOSI achieves this aim in a number of ways. Firstly, through engagement with policymakers around the world. In the United Kingdom, FOSI has long been an active member of the UK Council on Child Internet Safety (UKCCIS) and now sits on the executive board. Since the inception of the European Commission’s CEO Coalition to Make the Internet a Better Place for Kids, FOSI has had a high level of participation.  In the United States, FOSI regularly engages at the federal and state level to provide resources and raise awareness about online safety efforts. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="4" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 13.25pt; padding-left:4.75pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Secondly, FOSI achieves this aim through events. FOSI holds premier, highly visible conferences and forums around the world each year. We convene government leaders, industry members, teachers, parents, law enforcement professionals and charities to discuss and collaborate on finding actionable solutions to the challenges presented by the Internet.  Whilst at the same time working to highlight what can be done to responsibly take advantage of the infinite opportunities. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="5" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 13.25pt; padding-left:4.75pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Thirdly, FOSI has developed comprehensive, user-friendly resources for professionals and consumers. For professionals, we provide the Global Resource and Information Directory (GRID)</span><a name="_ftnref2"></a><a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">. GRID aggregates online safety laws, education initiatives, research and active parties in over 190 countries, and is monitored by an editorial team to ensure accuracy after notable events or legislative shifts. Additionally, FOSI has developed a resource for parents, teachers and teenagers, called A Platform for Good</span><a name="_ftnref3"></a><a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">, which is designed to allow users to ‘Connect, Share and Do Good’ online. It provides examples for teachers on how to incorporate technology into the classroom and gives children the opportunity to share stories on ways that they have used the Internet to help others or to enhance their own learning. Most importantly, A Platform for Good gives parents suggestions on how to talk to their children about staying safe online and provides interactive features and robust resources to help empower parents to become more engaged with the online lives of their children. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="6" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 13.25pt; padding-left:4.75pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Finally, FOSI has conducted numerous research studies in the United States into the online behaviour of teenagers and the concerns of parents.

Their use of media permits them to gain knowledge in a variety of new and engaging ways. Children are able to create and share their own content and express their ideas, thoughts and experiences on a worldwide platform. The Internet allows experiences that go far beyond their homes and communities; they are able to explore the world, immerse themselves in different cultures, geographies and periods in history instantaneously. The skills children learn through their online exploration in early life prepare them for their future and provide knowledge as well as the digital abilities that are vital for functioning in the modern technology-driven world.  </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="16" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">The accompanying risks and challenges that go along with living in an online world can not be discounted. Often, the skills and knowledge children have about new media far exceeds that of their parents. There is illegal activity online, just as there is offline, and there is a possibility that children can be exposed to content and actions that are harmful to their development and well-being. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="17" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Consequently, at FOSI, we believe the key to keeping children safe and ensuring that they have safe, productive and private experiences on the Internet, is to build a culture of responsibility online. This can only be accomplished if six separate entities work together to create a safer Internet. The key components are: 1) government; 2) industry; 3) parents; 4) law enforcement; 5) teachers; and 6) children. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="18" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Reasonable government support and oversight are essential components of this approach. An atmosphere of cooperation needs to be created amongst stakeholders, and cross-sector bodies, such as UKCCIS, are a great example of this. Funding for research into online behaviours and educational efforts that promote digital literacy and parental engagement, are vital. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="19" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Effective oversight of industry self-regulatory efforts allows for maximum innovation and development of creative solutions, whilst ensuring that industry continues to raise the bar in the field of online safety. As part of this, FOSI encourages robust and comprehensive industry self-regulation. As a membership organisation, FOSI brings together leading technology companies, who often compete with one another on other issues or for market share, to discuss emerging issues and create best practices and new solutions to increase privacy measures for children and adults alike. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="20" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">There has never been a time when so many resources have been available for parents, grandparents, teachers, and care givers to provide protection from online risks. All of the major operating systems and search engines provide family safety settings and mobile operators, social networks, and Internet Service Providers offer tools and settings to help protect families. Technological parental controls cannot replace involved and empowered parents, but they do continue to be a part of the solution in keeping children as safe as possible online when used to the best of their capacity. Technology develops at a rapid pace, and with each new development companies are working to stay current by creating new and innovative safety tools for parents and teachers.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="21" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Engaged and knowledgeable parents are vital to ensuring that children have a safe online experience.
