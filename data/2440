One of the areas covered is education. This Bill, via your committee, would seem an ideal vehicle for a particular piece of bureaucratic legislation to be amended. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">I should explain that OCR is part of the Cambridge Assessment Group which is a non-teaching department of the University of Cambridge and responsible for the running of its three exam board. OCR provides a range of academic and vocational qualifications across the education sector.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Background: </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">The Government has stated that it is keen to open up the Higher Education sector, including to further education colleges, to meet the changing needs of employers, and on the back of increases to tuition fees, individuals and their communities. The government has also said that it wishes to see a level playing field in which all providers offer full protection for students, as </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">laid</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> down by regulations classifying prescribed higher education courses and determining the scope of student support. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">We aim, in conjunction with our partners the Open University (OU), to establish a Higher Education (HE) offer in Further Education (FE). Ideally OCR would create a level 4 and 5 (equivalent to HNC /HND or a foundation degree) validated by the university. This qualification could then be topped up to full degree level by the OU through a credit or articulation agreement. What makes this a new approach is that the entire course would be delivered by Further Education colleges. OCR would manage the relationships with the colleges, who already deliver our higher and vocational courses, ensuring that they fulfilled criteria that meant they were able to deliver a higher quality HE programme as required by QAA quality standards. So, OCR would have responsibility for colleges and the quality of delivery and the OU would be responsible for the quality of the qualification at level 4</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">,5</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> and 6.    </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">This approach allows both OCR and OU to take full responsibility for our own elements of the programme. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Legislative roadblocks: </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Currently the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) distributes public money for higher education to universities and colleges in England, and ensures that this </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">money is used to deliver the greatest benefit to students and the wider public. HEFCE can fund Further Education Colleges (FECs). However,</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">they are </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; text-decoration:underline">only</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> able to fund FECs directly for ‘prescribed’ courses of higher education. Legislation sets out what those ‘prescribed’ courses are. These permissible funded courses are listed in the following two statutory instruments:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">-The Education (Prescribed Courses of Higher Education) (Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 1998 (SI 1998/1970).

The market barrier lies in the fact that these are ‘trade marked’ products owned by one commercial company.  The legislation makes no reference to any other provider or product, </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">nor</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> to the possibility of other entrants providing qualifications at these levels and delivered through FECs. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">At the time the legislation was drafted this was understandable; BTEC HNC and BTEC HND courses were created and owned by the University of London and its exam board, Edexcel, both bodies having charitable status; no similar qualification existed; and no other provider competed in this arena . However, today BTEC HND </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">are</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> the property of Pearson PLC. In the sector of exams and qualifications Pearson is a direct competitor to OCR and, in effect, this legislative throwback not only prohibits any chance of a level playing field within the market but also restricts the choices available to colleges and students. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">This market barrier could and should be easily resolved by a reference to equivalent qualifications in the legislation. This simple option has not to date been adopted, despite numerous representations made to government. We would question the appropriateness and desirability of legislation which simply by dint of its longevity specifically favours one product from one commercial organisation without providing an opportunity for reassessment as to its appropriateness.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Is there anything your Committee could do to change the situation?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Mark Dawe</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Chief Executive </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">OCR </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">     </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">4 September 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
