I was especially delighted to discover the many lovely tracks and footpaths leading out of the village onto the moors and surrounding villages. They were peaceful, tranquil paths with a feeling of history and a reminder of feet treading them through the ages. Motorised vehicles were never seen on them.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Over the last fifteen years or so four of these paths which previously had been used only by walkers, horses or farmers have been invaded by groups of off-roading motor bikes and 4x4 vehicles. After very expensive and time-consuming Public Inquiries these paths have been made into Byways Open to all Traffic (BOATs) because only evidence relating to historic use (ie horses and carts) could be considered at the Inquiry. No consideration was allowed to be given to danger to the public (many children visit this village), damage and erosion to the paths and noise which can be heard all round the village. The Parish Council now must apply to the authorities to request Traffic Regulation Orders (TROs) be placed on these BOATs.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">Surely this is a case which would benefit from a Deregulation Bill which allowed the authorities to consider all relevant evidence and protect the Peak District and other National Parks from such damage at a time when we are all in need of the peace and tranquility which our Parks can supply.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">September 2013</span></p><div style="width:auto; height:21.85pt; float:left;"><p style="margin:0pt"><a name="RAMFooter2"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">2</span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt"> of </span><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">1</span></a></p></div><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Gill Sans MT'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
