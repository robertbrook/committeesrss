All children need stability, love and belonging: the ‘permanence’ which is referred to often in research and reports. Residential care in itself and on its own, it is suggested, will not provide for such long term needs but it can make an important contribution to the overall plan for permanence and, if of high quality, provides a crucial option and the opportunity for meaningful relationships. Many young people have said that they wished to be in residential rather than in foster care, mindful of their experience of family life and the continuing role of their family relationships.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">1.2 The views of children and young people</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">There are important messages from children and young people and those who work on their behalf about ways to improve the care experience and build on what works for children.   Many children and young people benefit greatly from their care experience and it is important to them that they are not portrayed only in terms of the statistics − as failures academically or likely to enter the criminal justice system. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">However there is a need to make the best experience the usual experience for all children and to address the obstacles to this. Clearly, our response here cannot outline all the steps which could be taken to achieve this and we are aware of the important work recently undertaken by the ADCS, the Care Inquiry recommendations and other relevant research. As it may soon be part of our remit to address the rights of and to offer advice and assistance to this group of children, we are developing our perspective on these issues, together with the Children’s Rights Director and children and young people themselves.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">1.3 The rights of children under the UNCRC – how these apply to looked after children and to those in residential care in particular </span></p><p style="line-height:13.2pt; margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">These are not intended to represent a full children’s rights assessment but as key points which underpin our suggestions below:</span></p><p style="line-height:13.2pt; margin:5pt 0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Article 3: the primacy of the best interests of the child</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> − this underpins the need to find the right placement for each child according to an assessment of their needs. It follows that residential care should be a placement of choice and that the consideration of location should be led by need.

Children have frequently – most recently though the Care Inquiry – said that they are not always listened to or involved in decision about their lives. They often also do not have enough information to understand the decisions or nature of the placements proposed. Children have also given consistent messages about their wish to have sustained relationships with those caring for and supporting them. We consider that anything that can be done to support systems which enable this should be a priority: formal guidance can play a part here as can effective inspection processes which take into account the views of children using services. We comment further below on the place of residential care in sustaining relationships and offering stability.</span></p><p style="line-height:13.2pt; margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Article 19: protection ‘</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">’ − </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">in all placements the safety of children who are looked after must be addressed: we have proposed that meeting the safety needs of the child is included in both the care and placement plan.

This means that all children must have access to counselling and other therapeutic help and that carers and staff are well supported in their role in this help. In respect of residential care, evidence- based and well established therapeutic models are very important. The purpose of such a placement should always be clear: we concur with leading researchers in this field that all children’s homes should have a specialist purpose. This can be for temporary stays while work is done to prepare and search for a foster placement; for therapy with a specific timeframe; or for a secure setting where children have need for that level of protection and therapeutic help would also be offered. We suggest that there should be requirements for specialist children’s homes to be approved on this basis, rather than a continuance of generalist provision or homes which make inflated claims about therapeutic approaches and skills.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 36pt; orphans:0; text-indent:-18pt; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">g)</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Looked after children and young people’s access to independent advocacy is central to their voice being heard and often to their protection.
