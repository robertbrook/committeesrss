I actually wanted to attend this hearing  but was unable to due to these actions. I made a complaint to the PCP regarding these issues. In response I received emails from both the Chief Executive of the OPCC and the clerk to the PCP. Both tried to convince me that I was wrong with respect to the legislation and simply dismissed me. It was my view that it appeared that the officials were making judgements that the PCP should be investigating and making. I also suspected that they had questionable motives to want to dismiss my complaint.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">2.I then decided to write to all of the members of the panel because I felt that the officials were frustrating my complaint. However at the PCP meeting in January following the date of my email the issue was not raised. After the meeting I received a “leaked” email containing an email from the Clerk of the PCP to the chair of the PCP and a email from the chair to the panel members. This email  in my view was clearly a suppression of my complaint by the clerk and the chair. It clearly explained why the issue was not raised at the meeting. I did raise these emails during public questions at the next PCP meeting but the chair refused to allow me speak on it.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">3.At the January 2013 PCP meeting which included looking at the PCC budget it took me from the Public gallery to point out a £1 Million pound error in the PCC budget document!!!</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">4.I did bring these issues around the Deputy to the attention of the Local Government Ombudsman but they told me that the law did not permit them to investigate them. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">5.What was probably more concerning is during this period I was told  privately by some of the panel members  that the reason that the panel did not act upon my complaints was due to a perception that the PCC could seek “revenge” on them!</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">6.In March 2013 I contacted the clerk to the PCP who had also been the returning officer for the PCC election.

The DOA document is only signed by the PCC  It is my belief that this never happened which may explain why the CEO never gave me the detail information I requested. It is important to note that if the DOA is not completed correctly as outlined in  law the person elected cannot take up the post of PCC.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">8.After this I then had concerns regarding the appointment of a new Chief Executive to the OPCC and the failure of the PCC to apply section 7 of the Local Government and Housing act 1989 “</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">All staff to be appointed on merit”.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> I raised this matter before and after the confirmation hearing with the PCP and they took no action.

I contacted the PCC office to again to be dismissed. I then raised this with the PCP who asked the Chief Executive  to write a report. Not only did the report indicate that some of the statutory reports had not been done but did not clearly show the failure of the PCC which I knew of. It appeared that as long as the panel had its report it was not really interested in its content and took no further action. I made the Police Minister aware of some of these issues via my MP.  He simply replied tell me what should happen even though I had told him that it hadn't!</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">11.Following a freedom of information request by me to the OPCC in January 2013 I had to contact the ICO in order for the OPCC to comply with my request.

The panel lacks the depth of knowledge to understand some of the issues it was presented with. The officials are allowed far to much freedom to interfere with complaints and the powers given to the panel are next to useless. The law has also been deliberately  written so that a non criminal complaint by a member of the public results in no real accountability but to a dead end called “informal resolution”. To be fair to PCC's who can blame them for running wild with so little real accountability and punishment for failing to do their statutory duty. The law has made them  almost “untouchable” by the PCP and the public. To underline this point a former member of the Herts PCP Roger Seabourne after standing down said of the scrutiny panel that he "didn't want to be associated with a body that is such a toothless, worthless, ineffectual, waste of time, money and space...” in addition he said that "members of the public who asked questions were often given unsatisfactory answers or were ignored" by the panel. The elected Mayor of Watford who also stood down from the panel described it as a “crocodile with rubber teeth”. Even Police Minister Damian Green MP took no action!</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:justify; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">13.

In my view  significant changes are need to made to what was a rushed and ill thought out piece of legislation. In the first instance it is my view that  the role of PCC has been a very expensive failure and should be withdrawn.
