This is partly a function of finance being the predominant measure and outcomes and quality being much more difficult to evidence and measure. Combined with authorities looking to freeze or reduce spending while numbers of looked after children have increased in the last few years, the result is one where procurement officers from non-childcare backgrounds have enforced inappropriate systems and procedures and have dangerously sidelined their fellow professionals.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">This is where our view that the current state of play is one of systems rather than people comes from.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">We believe that a transformation in approach is needed. There are clear legal opinions in the public domain that state that EU procurement rules do not have to be applied to social care services. We would go further and advocate that such processes should be outlawed unless they meet certain criteria. Such criteria would include that the process be lead by a team that has expertise in children’s social care, education and mental health. That any desired service structure either is already evidenced to be effective for a well-defined cohort or that the service is designed as a research project.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">There is at best weak understanding of the provider sector, of its drivers and performance. Local Authorities often talk of market management and yet their approaches to this are difficult to detect. The provider sectors are increasingly dominated by independent sector organizations who have the potential to bring innovation and investment from outside of the public sector, but who are often not engaged in a way that encourages this.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; orphans:0; widows:0"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">4. To what extent is risk in local government procurement and contracting understood and managed and contracting strategies adopted, which are tailored to product and supplier market places? More specifically, do local authorities maintain and operate effective client management functions and have they entered contractual arrangements which allow the flexibility to meet changing circumstances such as budget reductions or changes in the way a service has to be delivered?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">The predominance of commissioners and procurement officers has lead to voluminous contractual arrangements in the sector, contracts which are developed and debated long and hard and which fail in at least two ways despite appearing in black and white terms to have moved much of the risk to the provider service.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Firstly the contracts tend to fail to focus on research and outcomes measurements, and have a focus of commercial details. Even where contracts do attempt quality measurement frameworks local authorities do not coordinate with one another to bring about consistency. This leaves providers</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> who deal with multiple authorities (which is what most providers do) dealing with multiple measurement frameworks, sometimes for the same home or foster agency or school.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Having designed monitoring and measurements into contracts local authorities substantially fail to follow these through. This sometimes relates to the volatility in their own professional staffing, with children being left without an allocated social worker, being unknown and un-contacted by virtual head teachers, having no representation at statutory reviews.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Contracts also tend to be too rigid, with authorities increasingly wanting to define in minute detail what they are buying, whereas a good provider working with a volatile and challenging young person with complex needs has to have flexibility to respond in real time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Once again we return to our theme that the contracts need to be about people not process and strict adherence to general rules. Relationship procurement and contract management is required, which demands higher levels of both technical and interpersonal skills than are prevalent today.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Finally, local authorities have inherent conflicts of interest in that they are often both procurers and providers.

Budget monitoring can be excellent but we have also seen instances where it is at best tortuous and at worse at risk from over- and under- invoicing.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">6. Is local authority procurement fully transparent, audited effectively and does it provide appropriate mechanisms for redress? Specifically, are the arrangements for securing the accountability of procured services and goods to local authorities and local residents adequate and effective? More specifically, to what extent are local authorities able to provide assurance to central government that value for money (in the broadest sense of the term) is delivered?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">The adherence to EU rules has brought about some transparency, but there is much here that can be improved also.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Tender processes have become increasingly dominated by price over difficult-to-measure quality and outcomes. Even where quality is measured and appears to be the dominant factor the scoring of tender tends to produce much wider scoring divergence on price methodology than on quality. Hence even where price is claimed to be 40% vs quality at 60% of the decision, if a top scoring low price provider can score 30% more than others because of the mathematical approach, and all bidders are within +/-10% of subjective quality measures, then price has still determined the outcome.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">There is little or no external scrutiny of the local authority procurement in this area, either during or after the process.
