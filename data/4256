However, with the current usage figures for England indicating that 133.2 bags are given out per capita per year, it is unlikely that the majority of single-use bags are used for this purpose. In addition, the experience in Ireland, where a scheme has been in place since 2002, demonstrated that whilst there was a 77% increase in the sale of plastic film bin liners (equating to 70 million bags), the 90% reduction in carrier bags (equating to one billion bags) meant there was still a net reduction of 930 million bags. It should also be noted that bin liners are rarely found as litter in any environment and subsequently don’t have the wider environmental impacts noted above.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="12" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt; text-indent:0.15pt"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt">The impact on the use of biodegradable bags is that usage of these products may increase. This is because the current proposals for England’s charging scheme exempt them – in effect, promoting their use above other types of materials. It should be noted that Defra has stated the exemption of these bags is subject to the development of new industry standards, which in turn would require new manufacturing processes, so any exemption and subsequent increase in usage is not imminent.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="13" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt; text-indent:0.15pt"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt">CPRE has a particular concern about biodegradable bags being exempt from the scheme. Any exemption of a particular material from the scheme could result in retailers switching to that material for their carrier bags in order to avoid the charge. This would undermine the central purpose of the scheme, which is to reduce usage. There is also the danger of reinforcing public misconceptions of what ‘biodegradable’ actually means. It is widely assumed that these bags are better for the environment; however most rely on complex chemical processes to degrade which can only happen in particular environments such as landfill, often resulting in a type of toxic waste, rather than a benign organic substance.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="14" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt; text-indent:0.15pt"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt">In addition, the exemption of a material that is highly similar in look and feel to other materials that aren’t exempted, such as a standard single-use plastic bag, will be confusing to consumers and will undermine the overall success of the scheme. It is a contrary message to give – this plastic is good but this plastic is bad – and would reduce any of the associated positive changes in behaviour that arise from schemes designed to incentivise responsible environmental behaviour.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 0.15pt"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="15" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt; text-indent:0.15pt"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt">CPRE understands the manufacture of biodegradable bags that could meet any new standard is likely to happen overseas.

However, such a figure for re-use is highly achievable with these types of bags due to their inherent durability, as well as consumers’ perceptions of them as non-disposable items.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="19" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt; text-indent:0.15pt"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt">CPRE took the decision in May 2012 to support a charge on carrier bags rather than a complete ban as the results from the first six months of the scheme in Wales already showed that significant reductions in usage could be achieved via charging, with a parallel increase in support for the scheme by consumers - 59% before the charge and 70% six months afterwards.

There should be no direct economic hardship to lower income groups following the introduction of the charge as it is not compulsory to purchase single-use carrier bags. It should be noted that a number of supermarkets that have traditionally catered to those on lower incomes, such as </span><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt">Aldi</span><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt"> and </span><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt">Lidl</span><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt">, have had charging schemes in place for a number of years. In a recent Which? survey </span><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt">Aldi</span><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt"> and </span><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt">Lidl</span><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt"> were voted the UK’s second and third favourite supermarkets (Waitrose came first) so charging for carrier bags clearly hasn’t undermined their position within the retail market nor their popularity with their customers.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="26" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt; text-indent:0.15pt"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt">It has recently been reported that bags for life may carry bacteria if raw meat and soil-covered vegetables have been carried in them. CPRE’s position is that, in addition to consumers using common sense, if the existing packaging used for raw meat isn’t suitable, then using a single-use plastic bag to transport it with a view to then throwing that bag away isn’t a sustainable option. Either the packaging industry needs to develop packaging for meat that is more suited to the task or develop a disposable bag for meat that is not made of a material that is designed to last for up to 1000 years.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 0.15pt"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="27" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal; list-style-position:inside; margin:0pt; text-indent:0.15pt"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt">In summary, a charge on carrier bags is a policy lever designed to reduce consumption, waste and litter. The Government stated its commitment to a zero waste economy in its Waste Review </span><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt">2011, although recently Dan </span><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt">Rogerson</span><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt"> MP wrote to the waste industry stating that, due to restrictions in public funding, the Government will be stepping back from supporting this sector and only offering a limited programme of waste prevention activities. As such, it is even more imperative that any charging scheme for single-use carrier bags is implemented in a way that works for the environment, retailers, consumers and industry, as well as providing a clear statement of commitment towards zero waste in England. There will not be the funds available for the communications work that will be required when consumers and retailers are confused by the multiple exemptions in England and the national discrepancies they will experience when travelling across UK borders. The Government should seek to rectify the current proposals so that they are in line with those in operation in Wales.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">10 </span><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">December 2013</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:center"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
