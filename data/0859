Pre-constriction of their airways plays a large part in rendering them wheezy, and they are at high risk of steroid complications if this is not recognised and they are treated (by guidelines) like asthmatics with normal BMI. </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Education</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> of </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">primary</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> care </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">teams</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> is important, but most of these patients do require specialist support from expert </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">teams</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> (and many secondary care respiratory </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">physicians</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt"> and A&amp;E doctors are not fully aware of the issues either).</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Asthma is an important chronic condition – much of it is mild and can be managed in the community – this has been a major objective for respiratory physicians and allergists since the late 1980s when the first national guidelines for asthma were produced. A significant minority have more severe disease, which either requires large doses of standard therapy or fails to respond to standard therapy. Many of these end up on medium to long term oral steroid therapy.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Within the hospital sector we </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">continue to </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">see those patients whose asthma is difficult to control, either because it is exceptionally severe or because adherence to therapy is poor.

Within the specialist services commissioning framework there are plans for a network of tertiary centres whose primary function is to review these patients, separate the wheat from the chaff and get them into appropriate management pathways. While the allergy community feels the number of centres needed to do this should be larger than the number envisaged in the original proposal from the CRG, we accept the general principle that these patients require multidisciplinary assessment by expert teams and should not be managed in conventional general chest clinics.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">Turning to the definition of Chronic Long-Term Conditions</span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">, I am not clear whether allergic conditions are regarded as </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">CLTCs </span><span style="font-family:'Frutiger LT Std 45 Light'; font-size:11pt">for the purposes of this inquiry.
