This initiated a work stream of consultation with the production divisions of the corporation, effectively a requirements gathering exercise. It indicated the need for a "work in progress" asset management system for TV production and a digital "archive" for completed master recordings. The subsequent requirements document formed part of a business case for DMI submitted to the Director General’s Finance Committee in Q2 calendar year 2007. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 35.45pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="3" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Throughout the following two year period I had regular contact with the DMI team during their attempts to deliver a working system within the Siemens delivery contract. I represented the interests of the production communities and regularly liaised between senior production figures and DMI management. Within a year it became obvious that DMI was in significant difficulty as it continued to miss delivery commitments. By the end of 2008 the credibility of the project was very low and it became increasingly challenging to explain its failings to senior production figures who relied on my technical understanding. By early 2009 I was aware that problems with the project were causing tensions between the corporation and its technology partner Siemens.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 35.45pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Siemens contract terminated</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="4" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">In the autumn of 2009 in a conversation with a senior technology figure who reported to John Linwood, I describe the decision to tear up the contract with Siemens as a </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">"reckless act"</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> adding </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">"They </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">(DMI team) </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">will probably never be able to deliver the project now". </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">I qualify my comments indicating that a key technical challenge and therefore risk for DMI was the capability of the BBC's computer network to support the system. I indicated that as Siemens operated and managed this network for the BBC, Siemens had effectively underwritten this risk by also being the contractor who had committed to deliver DMI, by tearing up the contract and bringing the project "in-House" the BBC took on this risk. The individual indicated that he understood this "dynamic".</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="5" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">In January 2010 I am asked to provide my subject matter expertise for a newly prepared benefits case for DMI. During a meeting I raise a question whether taking specific component parts of the DMI technology in isolation could more effectively deliver benefits. I highlight that this approach could also reduce project delivery risks by focusing in on one or two components. It was agreed between myself and a senior finance figure in BBC Vision that I should seek to interview the delivery leads of DMI to ascertain whether this would be an opportunity. It was also suggested that I raise some additional questions.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 35.45pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="6" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">In the following days I meet with some members of the DMI leadership team for a Q &amp; A session.

As these responses had been moderated by the DMI team I considered these to be an accurate reflection of their view. At the time I felt the clarity of the responses were not of a standard that informed me satisfactorily about the future DMI proposition. It raised many questions about the funding for DMI specifically wrt to Project North where there appeared to be a significant gap in the operational expenses,  additionally a critical risk associated with the BBC’s computer network had not been mitigated or addressed. During various discussions with fellow senior colleagues within Vision Productions and Children's television I repeated my concerns that the finances for the project looked unclear and that I believed there to be a significant number of questions around the technology yet to be resolved. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">[page 024, 031-034]</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Preparation of the 2010 revised Benefits Case</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 35.45pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="8" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">I am invited to take part in a meeting to further address the benefits case for DMI.

Myself and the Production Innovation Executives from the relevant production divisions did some rough estimates of costs, our calculations totalled approximately £7 Million for the project lifespan. All agreed that these numbers were based on rough workings however some rationale had been applied. The meeting concluded with these cost avoidance figures being the only numbers discussed during the two hour session.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 35.45pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="9" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 31.35pt; padding-left:4.65pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The following day I am forwarded an email, it is a copy of a summary briefing of the cost avoidance meeting. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">[page 040,042]</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> Despite the importance of the email I had not received this directly but was provided it by one of the production staff who also attended the meeting and who wished to draw my attention to it. Attached was a spread sheet which purported to be a recording of the figures discussed, however there were three additional columns detailing additional cost avoidance figures I had not previously seen (under headings  "Jim Dobel/FM&amp;T", "Alan Whiston/ Dirk-Willem van Gulik", "Jim Dobel"). These additional columns totalled £8.4Million. Although the sheet indicated that these figures had been produced based on information from the meeting, these columns had not featured in our discussions. I became concerned about the veracity of these numbers as I had not had opportunity to clarify them nor was I aware that any of my colleagues had had a similar opportunity. The sheet appeared to indicate that these figures had been based on the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">"professional judgement of the production innovation execs"</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">. For the removal of doubt I did not believe this to have been the case. One of the cost items was "Datacentre &amp; Storage Management costs" and equalled £3 Million. This line item alone defied reason as this cost would only occur if DMI went ahead. It is my belief that the reason I was not recorded as having attended this meeting or been on the original distribution list for the email and summary was because the authors would have known I would realise the additional £8.4Million to be unjustified. In looking at these costs it was clear to me that the numbers had simply been made up by the group who authored the sheet. </span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 35.45pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="10" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Sometime later in February 2010 I have a brief meeting with a Vision Productions finance person. They wished to clarify their understanding of some of the benefits and cost avoidance of DMI. I detect an element of concern in their own view and they show me a document which I believe to have been a section of the revised business case. It highlights the cost avoidance numbers, these assert the costs avoided if DMI goes ahead to be £15Million, it uses words to the effect </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">"these figures are ratified by the CTO of the BBC"</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">. I indicate my immediate concern that these are unjustified figures in my view. I describe the numbers as </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">"like Enron" </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">referring to the approach of adjusting estimated figures to suit needs rather than being based on pragmatic rationale.

During the workshop 36 questions were raised by Project North members and subsequently submitted in written form to the DMI team. Answers to these were crucial for North to progress with its own project. During the meeting I am offered a demonstration of a key piece of DMI functionality which I email to confirm my interest. I and many colleagues considered the performance of the DMI representatives during the workshop as chaotic and without a clear understanding of their technology solution. A number of colleagues describe the meeting as “farcical”.

Children’s television was the only area in the production community slated to have a delivery at this proposed release. For the removal of doubt no release was made to anywhere in Vision Productions or Children's during this period. The Natural History Unit was expecting DMI to be ready for the series “Frozen Planet” which this was due in post-production. The delay by DMI was likely to cause production issues, as a result a stand-alone (digital island) solution was put in place. This was not DMI connected to any archive functionality however it was funded by the DMI project.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">Following my resignation from the BBC</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 35.45pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="18" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">(04/06/2010) I leave the BBC, in the months following I remain in close contact with many key stakeholders who confirm that no DMI functionality had been delivered.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 35.45pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="19" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">(June 2010) I read an article in trade paper Broadcast, it is an interview with John Linwood in which he indicates that DMI is </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">"live and in production and being used in the BBC". </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">I know John Linwood's statement to be misleading. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">[page 087-089]</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 35.45pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="20" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">(Jan 2011) I read the NAO report and associated press coverage.

Essentially it could not be claimed that the DMI system was working if the design and delivery of the infrastructure had yet to be commissioned at the time of the report and subsequent hearing. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">[pages 090]</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 35.45pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="22" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">(During 2011 – 2012) I have regular catch ups with colleagues still working at the BBC and in areas close to the DMI project.

It is my belief that this was as a result of very poor technical direction by the BBC evident in the DMI team’s inability to show me technical designs for the proposal. From Q1 2010 when the project was claiming a delivery schedule which included a “Basic Archive” and “Production Tools” they did not have a design that would deliver a viable implementation. </span></li><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">From the outset the technical leadership of DMI appeared mismatched with the skills required for such a project. This was compounded by a lack of understanding by the team of contractual boundaries the BBC had in place with many of its technology providers who would be necessary stakeholders. With the challenging environment created by the scale of the BBC and some of the investment needed around infrastructure (such as the network) this meant the chances of success were extremely low. In essence the DMI team did not grasp the scale of the challenge.</span></li><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">A year later when Mark Thompson and Erik Huggers gave oral evidence to the committee hearing on the 15</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:7.33pt; vertical-align:super">th</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> February 2011 the BBC was still to commission the design and delivery of the infrastructure for DMI which must bring into question their evidence.

Many senior figures had also reputations invested in DMI. The resulting behaviours ensured that concerns external to DMI were either dismissed or shut down and business cases and other approvals were simply waived through without proper scrutiny. This culture ensured the project continued receiving funds, this was not one person but a very large group of people. There were a number of individuals senior in the technology division who held the responsibility to safe guard public funds in this area but did not act despite being aware of this situation. In some cases I believe certain individuals acted wilfully to subvert governance processes and falsify value propositions so as to deceive the various consideration panels. This most serious matter is one I believe the BBC has a responsibility to investigate.</span></li><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The 2013 PwC report into DMI followed a mandate set by the BBC Trust consisting of seven questions which narrowed the investigation to just governance issues. I believe there now remains a risk of a repeat of these circumstances because there are no conclusions about the real causes and therefore recommendations to mitigate them. I indicated to the Trust and the PwC team the significance of the 2010 business case and my concerns that this crucial step required examination. This business case permitted spending on the DMI project despite a questionable proposition, accordingly placing considerable public funds at significant risk. I am unaware if there has been any review of the preparation of this case.</span></li><li style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The BBC does deliver large scale technology projects very well. Many of my former colleagues are committed to delivering value for money for licence fee payer, however there remains a number of individuals within the leadership of the Technology and North divisions of the BBC who need to account for their actions in relation to the management of DMI.</span></li></ol><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:150%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">17 January 2014</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
