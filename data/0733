But, as Paul Flattery, managing partner at trend analysts Trajectory has said, “this doesn’t mean that people don’t care” about the environment and climate change. In fact, in 2010, 71 per cent of people were still very concerned or fairly concerned about climate change, and two thirds believe that it poses risks to people in Britain.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">And the number of people who think climate change is a ‘very serious’ problem has begun to rise again from 43 per cent in 2010 to 49 per cent in 2011. When asked about the greatest problems facing the world (rather than just Britain) people in the UK are more concerned about climate change than the economy. Forty four per cent of respondents to a 2011 Eurobarometer survey said that climate change was the single biggest problem facing the world, while 39 per cent said the economic situation. This represents a shift from 2008 (when 57 per cent said climate change and 24 per cent the economy), but shows that UK citizens still view climate change as the greater global priority. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 6pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-variant:small-caps">Pa</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-variant:small-caps">rt of, not against, the economy</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">However, framing the question in terms of absolutes and asking people to choose which single issue matters most will always provide overly simplistic answers. Asking people to rate the importance of the economy vs environment is likely to underplay the seriousness of environmental challenges.

Many behaviours that have a lower impact on the planet also make less of a dent in people’s finances. As the Asda report says “Austerity Britain hasn’t pushed green issues off the agenda, instead it’s made saving energy and cutting waste…the new normal.” But this is not the only motivation. Wanting to ‘do the right thing’ is the main reason that Asda customers gave for buying green products, across all income brackets. On average 79 per cent said this was their primary motivation. And this feel good factor is most powerful for lower income households (83 per cent). </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">Interest in green living also extends to the half of the population who belong to socio-economic categories C1 (lower end white collar workers) and C2 (skilled manual workers). They are only marginally less interested in sustainable living than their poorer and wealthier counterparts.

The aim of such policy measures should be to use the best of the evidence base to encourage desirable behaviours and to discourage undesirable ones. While the nudge approach has something to offer this process, it cannot replace policy which helps to create new choices or makes damaging behaviour difficult or impossible to pursue. Successful initiatives are likely to need all the policy tools available; a mix of well-designed information, incentives, regulation, services and nudges to encourage the desired actions and outcomes. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">April 2013</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div><hr style="width:33%; height:1px; text-align:left" /><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><a name="_ftn1"></a><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">http://www.green-alliance.org.uk/uploadedFiles/Publications/reports/Neither%20sermons_FW.pdf</span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><a name="_ftn2"></a><a href="#_ftnref2">[2]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">http://www.green-alliance.org.uk/uploadedFiles/Publications/reports/Green_affordable_Pol_Ins_singles.pdf</span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><a name="_ftn3"></a><a href="#_ftnref3">[3]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">http://www.green-alliance.org.uk/uploadedFiles/Publications/reports/Green_affordable_Pol_Ins_singles.pdf</span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><a name="_ftn4"></a><a href="#_ftnref4">[4]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">http://www.green-alliance.org.uk/uploadedFiles/Publications/Hot%20Air_online(2).pdf</span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><a name="_ftn5"></a><a href="#_ftnref5">[5]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">http://www.green-alliance.org.uk/grea_p.aspx?id=6629</span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><a name="_ftn6"></a><a href="#_ftnref6">[6]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">http://www.green-alliance.org.uk/uploadedFiles/Publications/reports/Neither%20sermons_FW.pdf</span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><a name="_ftn7"></a><a href="#_ftnref7">[7]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">http://www.green-alliance.org.uk/uploadedFiles/Publications/reports/Briefing_green%20deal_FINAL.pdf</span></p><p style="font-size:10pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><a name="_ftn8"></a><a href="#_ftnref8">[8]</a><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt">http://www.green-alliance.org.uk/grea.aspx?id=5592</span></p></body></html>
