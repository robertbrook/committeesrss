The chair of the Oxo Biodegradables Plastics Association claimed it did not and further claimed to have scientific evidence to support this, we assume Mr Stephen was referring to the Roediger Report commissioned by Symphony Plastics in 2012. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The Roediger report initially claims to show that oxo-degradable materials represent no threat to recycling. There are some unsubstantiated comments about building film – the report claims it is good practice (not that we aware of) to add stabilisers to building film to protect against degradation of normal recycled materials and then, in the next sentence, that the conditions under concrete or brick do not allow oxygen to break down the oxo-degradable materials if they were present in building films anyway! More importantly though, the Roediger report, which the </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">Oxo Biodegradables Plastics Association</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> use as evidence that the presence of oxo-degradable materials in recyclate does not compromise the integrity of the finished products in fact shows that at even a 20% inclusion rate tensile performance drops by 16% (MD) and 24% (TD) immediately and after 300 hours of ageing by 25% (MD) and 39% (TD)! Not many recycled products would tolerate such a deterioration in performance! It’s hard to argue that such a reduction is “negligible”!</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="color:#1f497d; font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">The Roediger report suggests that to ‘neutralise’ the impact of the oxo degradable additives in polythene film, a neutralising agent should be added at the time of re-melting the waste polythene film prior to its re-extrusion back into plastic pellet, for eventual re manufacture into a new product. Firstly, it is important to understand that the recycling process and (even) the addition of a neutralising agent does not destroy or eliminate the oxo degradable agents present in the film waste, it merely slows down the eventual on-set of bio degradation, thus for long life products such as agricultural, building or construction films, the risk to product integrity would be too great – despite the presence of any neutralising agents, recycled plastic films containing </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">oxo biodegradable contamination would eventually start to degrade. The risk of this happening for suppliers such as ourselves would be too great, thus these products would revert to being manufactured from prime/virgin material.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">In the event that bio degradable contaminated carrier bags started to enter the UK waste stream, and taking the Oxo Biodegradbles Plastics Association suggestion that a neutralising agent should be added, the question has to be asked – who will pay the additional cost? We assume the so called neutralising agents will be an anti-oxidant or a</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> compatibilising agent, current cost circa £2,000 tonne. Assuming an addition rate of 2% - this will increase the cost to UK recyclers of £40 tonne. The UK plastic recycling sector reprocessed 280,000 tonnes of product in 2012 – DEFRA figures – thus the cost to the UK recycling sector would be (based on 2012 figurs) £11.2 million p.a. Who will pay for this additional raw material cost? UK recyclers will not be able to pass it on to their customers in the form of higher selling prices – thus the UK plastic recycling sector will become further disadvantaged compared to our overseas competitors.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">In his evidence Michael Stephen claimed he had “met UK plastic recyclers who did not have a problem with oxo degradable materials contaminating the UK waste stream”. We have to ask “who are these businesses”? The British Plastics Federation, Recycling Group; PAFA; The EuPC and ourselves BPI, who collectively represent at least 90% of the UK plastic films recycling sector cannot find anyone who supports this suggestion. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">We are not alone in our suggestions that oxo biodegradable contaminated carrier bags entering the waste stream would do untold harm to our sector. The latest draft report from the EU Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee suggests that these materials should be banned outright.
