As such it is an atypical estuary type, with deep saline penetration. As an estuarine species with limited tolerance of full strength sea water, the smelt will be restricted to the upper reaches of the estuary only. The smelt data put forward in this case was relatively poor. In contrast, the Medway estuary has been designated but the smelt is not a featured species, in spite of the wealth of data available demonstrating that there is significant self-supporting  smelt population present.

That kind of ecological and socio-economic importance should be built into our management regimes. The MCZ is only one of the tools in the box. We entirely agree with government that the management of mobile species such as fish can also be achieved through sensitive management regimes. In cases such as the above, it would not be necessary to ban a</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">l</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">l activities in order to protect and promote the nursery provisioning provided by the estuary. In fact a voluntary trawling ban above Gravesend was agreed upon between the Environment Agency (then the local sea fisheries power) and 50 local fishermen, in 1998. The ban was formalised as a local sea fisheries byelaw in 2009. </span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ol start="10" type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The Fisheries Minister alluded to the potentially high costs associated with designating and enforcing all 127 sites this year in an article in the Guardian in March 8</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:7.33pt; vertical-align:super">th</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">. We would take some issue over the particular point about enforcement costs. In a remote offshore location, enforcement could indeed be high, particularly if there is an overseas fisheries dimension. By contrast, in inshore sites, if the engagement process has been fully inclusive, is based on sound accessible science and has successfully engendered strong commitment, the enforcement costs can be very low indeed.  In a fishery related mechanism, such a situation can promote a high level of self-enforcement.  Under these circumstances, good commitment from all the regulators operating in inshore waters can reduce the vessel enforcement and intelligence gathering costs significantly through collaborative work. There are very good examples of such arrangements in a number of Regulating Order shellfisheries </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">and in estuaries in the Thames, Devon and elsewhere where trawling restrictions have been agreed in an inclusive and coherent manner. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> In the inner Thames trawling ban case cited above, c</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">ommitment and compliance has been extremely high and enforcement costs are minimal, since everyone is watching, fishermen anglers &amp; regulators.</span></li></ol><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">In summary, The IFM strongly supports the first tranche of designations.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> We believe that there are lessons to be learnt, that can now be put to good use. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Sustainable management and development must be built around accessible robust science operating at the heart of open and frank negotiations, followed by rigorous post-project appraisal with active lesson uptake.  The Institute has a wealth of experience in this field.
