There is no staff list, so parents have no easy way of kno</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">wing the names of people on the staff team. The Harris complaints procedure is very complex and unwieldy. The Harris Federation never reply to complaints directed to them by email.  Newsletters mainly contain a list of rules and regulations, and dates.

There are no longer any class newsletters or any information about the current topics being studied.

Many of our children are wearing the flimsy Harris raincoat rather than a proper winter coat, probably because many parents cannot afford two different coats, and the Harris coat is only optional in cold weather. </span></li><li style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 33.66pt; padding-left:2.34pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Changing the uniform for a </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">whole school is extraordinarily wasteful – Harris made no attempt to collect the uniform for charity or recycling.

It was left to parents to organise their own</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> collection for charity and some of the Roke uniform was sent to a school for street children in Kenya. The onus should have been on the academy chain to sort this out not parents.
