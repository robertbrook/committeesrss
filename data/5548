font-size:12pt">large</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> number of organisations and individuals; we will probably publish for the record what they have suggested.  To be absolutely clear in our understanding, if I could first focus on the Environment Agency and Government input, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dan Rogerson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The Government is very aware of the fact that we need to invest significantly in flood defences to ensure that we are protecting property and people, and to protect the local economies from the damage that flooding causes.  It also causes huge emotional turmoil and upset to individuals, families and businesses when this happens as well.  Given the events that have happened over recent weeks, I would like to take this opportunity to put on record my thoughts and those of colleagues, which are with all those people who have been affected.  I would echo your comments, Madam Chairman, on the huge efforts that were made by Agency colleagues, but also local government colleagues and the emergency services, as well as local volunteers, in dealing with the issues.  Government has invested £2.3</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">billion across flood defences in the current Spending Review period.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dan Rogerson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I may hand over to Paul </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Leinster</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> here to talk about the specifics about the damage and what we are picking up, because Agency colleagues are out there and have been assessing that damage with regard to the east</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">coast event that happened in early December.  We have since then had fluvial flooding, groundwater events and further coastal flooding over the Christmas and new-year period.  Some of that work, because rivers are still high, is in progress, but Mr </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Leinster</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> will be able to give some perspective on the assessment of that damage.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Leinster</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Thank you.  We are currently still assessing the level of funding required to repair both the damage that happened during the early December surge, because that did affect the west coast as well as the east coast, and also then the flooding that primarily impacted on the south-west and the south of the country through the new-year period.  We are looking at that money, we are identifying the need and we are having discussions with Defra colleagues about that.  We also know that they are having conversations with Treasury about that.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We have carried on with our repair work.  One of the things that we were concerned about was that we got the flood risk management assets up again to a condition where they would withstand the tides that came in early January and then further high tides, which will come in February, and so we have been pressing on with that emergency repair work.  What we will then need to do is make sure we have a programme of work that will go through the following year to make sure that all of those assets are repaired.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q5 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Do you recognise something that you said in an interview, Mr </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Leinster</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">?</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Y</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">ou said, “Flood risk maintenance will be further impacted...All of our work on mapping and modelling and new developments in things like flood warning will also have to be resized.  And we’re looking at a proportionate reduction in the number of people in flood risk management”</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">  What I am trying to establish is how much of the money is going to go on physical infrastructure, which is important—no one would disagree—but you do need to maintain the same physical infrastructures, as well as doing the dredging and maintenance of the main channels.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Paul </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Leinster</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes, I do recognise those words and, as you say, there are two broad categories of expenditure.  There is the capital, and we know what the plan is for that capital.  We also know that, over this Spending Review period, our revenue budget has been reducing.  We have been looking at how we can deliver greater efficiency, how we can carry out those tasks in different ways, to maximise the outcomes that we are delivering with the available funding.  That is true with all public bodies and with councils.  Everybody in the public sector is facing reducing funding and we are managing that.  That will have an impact in some of those areas that you, Chair, have mentioned, and it will reduce the number of staff that we are able to afford.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q6 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Against </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">that</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> backdrop, what is your overall assessment of the capability of the existing flood defences </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">and</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> the flood response agencies since the extreme weather events started, as you mentioned, in early December?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';

font-size:12pt">: Also as I said, and is on the record, through the reorganisation that we will be going through, we will still be able to maintain the level of flood incident response that we have shown.  One of the things on record is that we had, over both the Christmas and new-year period</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">s</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, fully staffed-up rotas, and we have had people on rotas throughout this whole period. Through any reductions </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">in</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> funding, one of the things that we have been looking at very carefully—and we have had challenge from our board about this—is making sure that any of the new arrangements will enable us to have the proper level of incident response.  We believe we will be able to do that.  In addition to that, we have also said that, through the organisational change that we will go through, we will seek to protect frontline services.  We might have to do that in different ways, but that is what we are looking to do.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dan Rogerson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I have obviously had the opportunity to visit Agency staff on the ground, as I said, who have worked very hard.  I recognise that it is a challenge for them to meet the demands that we as a </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">society</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> are placing on them with the resource that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">is</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> available to us in Government, given that we are where we are with national finances and dealing with the deficit.  However, what I saw there are staff who work in other aspects of the Agency’s work who are supporting Agency colleagues who are the frontline flood responders.  Also, for example, when the east</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">coast flood was on before December, staff came from the west to support colleagues there.  The Agency is responding very flexibly to that and is clearly prioritising these jobs.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt;

font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">up</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> operation, is there anything that has been done or your Department can do to work with DCLG—I would like to hear Mr Jones’ view on this as well—to put right the gross injustice that seems to be happening to councils </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">such as </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Cornwall</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> over the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Finally, and it is all linked to response again, I was quite surprised to hear a local councillor blaming the Environment Agency for the lack of distribution of sandbags in my constituency on a visit to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Looe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> the previous afternoon to when you came.  When I asked the Environment Agency, I understood local councils are still able to provide sandbags to prevent flooding.  Could</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">you just confirm that this is the case, please?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dan Rogerson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Madam Chairman, I echo Mrs</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Murray’s comments about the community in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Looe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and how resilient they are.  They, as a coastal community, over centuries have had to deal with episodes </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">like</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> this, but there were very high tides.  They were rolling up their shirt sleeves and getting on with it, but they obviously deserve the same level of support that other communities get.  As with anywhere else, a business case that comes forward for the cost</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">effectiveness</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> of a flood defence scheme, which I know is being developed with the community there, would be assessed and would be open to funding in the same way that others are.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">One thing that I also welcomed there and in other places that I visited is the attitude local authorities are taking towards their economic development, using flood defences, through the partnership funding formula, as </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Councillor</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Jones has said, to look at other opportunities.  In one place it was about </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">protecting</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> sandy beaches or recreating them—not in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Looe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">; that was on the east coast over in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Essex</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">—to stimulate tourism in a seaside town, which perhaps had seen a bit of a decline in tourism.  In </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Looe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, we heard how they may want to provide more moorings for visiting boats and also to allow the visiting fleet to stay in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Looe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> when the weather is getting bad and not for the larger boats to have to head off to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Plymouth</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.  They are looking at the economic impacts, partnering that up with that need to protect residential </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">property as well.  That is the right approach.  It will allow us to unlock funding through that partnership approach, as Councillor Jones has said.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">With regard to the specific point about sandbags, obviously the Environment Agency has responsibilities on the ground in some river catchments and some coastal areas, with some of the infrastructure that is there that the Agency has responsibility for.  Through the resilience planning that goes on, local authorities will usually make provision to provide things there.  Of course, local residents as well, having been given warning and knowing that they are in areas that are prone to flooding, will quite often have precautions and have some facilities.  We provide resources from Government through local authorities for property</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">level</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> protection, so that people can be prepared.  Again, we saw some good examples of that in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Looe</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> on the Saturday that we visited in the new year.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';

font-size:12pt"> had with Councillor Jones; there are issues there that he will be raising with colleagues at CLG about how that works.  Of course, if there is anything I can do to support on evidence and making sure that those discussions proceed, I would be happy to do so.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Cllr Jones:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> From our point of view, Chairman, I was involved in a telephone conversation with CLG, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt"> in terms of planning the recovery from the floods.  It is very welcome that £6.7</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">million has been made available, with hopefully a very streamlined system to enable councils and communities to apply for that money to get it into the ground to aid that recovery.  There is a sense of urgency about the high tides that are expected in February, particularly where coastal sites have been severely damaged.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I have to say I will express significant disappointment that the LGA was not involved in the COBRA meetings earlier on.  I think that was a mistake by Government Departments and I think we should be there at the table, because we are the ones delivering on the ground.  That is my point on that.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

it is out of date.  It is perverse.  </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Cornwall</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and my own council are good examples, where district councils with small budgets—0.2% is a very small number before help is able to be given by Government under that formula.  For a large council like ourselves, a unitary now, and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Cornwall</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> in particular, which is even larger, we have to spend quite a bit.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';

font-size:12pt">Cornwall</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.  I think ours is £800,000 before we can get help.  That seems very perverse.  I have not got any evidence for this, but it could also attract the wrong </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">behaviours</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, because a county council could turn around and say, “Why should we help?  Let the district councils do all the work, because they can claim the most money back.”  Therefore, county councils would not participate.  There are some real issues about the way that the revenue side of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Belwin</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> operates.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">On the capital side, I have some very serious concerns as well.  We have one issue, for example in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Allerdale</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">where</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> the coastal erosion went five metres into the coastline and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">actually exposed what appeared to be a contaminated waste tip that was closed in the early 1960s.  I was speaking to the Member earlier today about this</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">T</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">he cost of the coastal protection is significant and, for a small district council, 50% of a very big number is enough to floor a district council in these very difficult financial times for councils.  I have very serious concerns about the way the capital side operates as well, and I think there are opportunities, perhaps if we work with Government, to develop a better scheme that provides better, in inverted commas, insurance cover between councils and Government that will deliver better solutions for councils and communities—most importantly communities.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In terms of sandbags, I have to say the warning systems that the EA and the Met Office put out in November, December and January were excellent.  They were accurate and certainly the tidal surge that we saw in December was absolutely spot on in terms of the levels it reached, certainly around the Dee Estuary, which I am familiar with.  It was slightly higher than what actually happened by a few inches, thankfully, in January, but I think that those warnings allowed councils to be very proactive, to distribute sandbags, work with communities, enable the resilience teams to get up and running, and put all our emergency procedures in place, which we do a lot of the planning and exercising for.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">That itself proactively enabled a better service to communities, and particularly the old and vulnerable.  When you are dealing with elderly people and moving them out of their house because it might be flooded, to do it in a rush is actually quite a difficult experience for an elderly person, a vulnerable person.  If you can do it a few days beforehand, talk to them, help them out, move them slowly and move their possessions upstairs, you are working with the elderly people in a much more caring way, which is much more in line with what you want to do.  The warning systems that the EA invoked over the last few months have been excellent and much appreciated by councils across the country.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt;

font-size:12pt">and</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> resilience in respect of flood defence systems.  What contingency plans do flood response agencies, such as the Environment Agency and local authorities, have in place for emergency situations, and were emergency plans successfully implemented over the Christmas period following a month of reflection?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-weight:bold">Leinster</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: If I lead on that, we have been in a state of readiness in terms of our flood incident response since the beginning of December because, at that time, we had both the west and east coast surges, so we had to be prepared for that.  We have got highly developed emergency plans </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">that</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> we put into place.  We have a national incident room.  Before the Christmas period and the period after Christmas through the new year that national incident room was open for 20 days.  For some of those, it was open on a 24/7 basis.  Each of our areas that is responding to a flood event also has an area incident room.  We have regular meetings that we call between those different levels, and we co</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">ordinate our response.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Before an event happens, we put our crews out to make sure that any blockages are cleared, that screens are cleared and that gates are shut, and we make sure that the flood defences are in the right state.  Then, as the event unfolds, we continue to do that work.  We had our rotas fully staffed up over Christmas and new year.  I in fact went and visited a couple of the incident rooms between Christmas and new year to thank the staff for the sterling work that they were doing.  That was the second year running that I had been back to those places because, you will remember, back in 2012 we also had significant flooding and the Environment Agency was responding during all of that as well.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">One of the key phrases that we now use in the Environment Agency is “think big, act early” for all of these events, and “always expect the unexpected”.  We make sure that that is how we ramp up our response work.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">throughout</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> the winter period, ensuring that Government Departments are working together with agencies and the sector bodies that they liaise with.  Obviously it was important to have representation there from the Department for Transport, from DECC and from </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CLG in particular, which was liaising with colleagues.  I do take on board the position that Councillor Jones has outlined in terms of the LGA presence at COBRA, which I understand has happened occasionally in the past for some circumstances.  Certainly CLG was very much liaising directly with local authorities, and that is a suggestion there that we could take forward.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We very much welcome the work that has been done by the Flood Forecasting Centre, which takes colleagues from the Agency background, with their understanding of how the impacts are felt on the ground, with Met Office and forecasting colleagues to bring them together to look at the impacts.  As we have heard, that was very much crucial to allowing the agencies and the people on the ground to have the information at their fingertips to be able to deal with the response.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Certainly when I have been in incident rooms, we work very well with our partners, particularly the Environment Agency and, if I dare mention it, utilities as well.  Although they are category two responders, they do understand their duty to co</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt"> are involved in planning exercises, and we do not see any barriers that exist between the partners.  I have certainly not seen any and none have been reported to us, of any issues, unless it is obviously a character issue between two individuals.  Broadly, as far as I am aware, that works incredibly well.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt;

font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">help in place.  Particularly in our very rural areas and exposed areas, it is really important, because sometimes, particularly with snow as a good example, you cannot get to them unless you have a helicopter.  You cannot even do that when it is snowing.  </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Cornwall</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is a very good example of that, and so is the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Lake District</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">million</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">was </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">pulled in, in partnership funding or funding from other sources, which is obviously helpful but, in this Spending Review period, it has been £148</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">million or will be by the end of the Spending Review period.  There has been a real step change in that.  We have heard from Councillor Jones and Mr </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Leinster</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> that some of the schemes that ha</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">ve</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> allowed us to deliver are already protecting property and people around the country.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">As I said earlier, there is a recognition that we can achieve several different outcomes through some schemes.  </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">For</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> example, in part answer to Mr </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Drax’s</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> point about the demand to improve the quality of the natural environment as well and protect biodiversity, some schemes in some parts may involve the creation of wetlands and things like that to manage water resources, which are achieving multiple outcomes.  In the case of some coastal communities, it might be providing better moorings, to provide more leisure opportunities or to recreate sandy beaches.  There are multiple outcomes, which local authorities see the benefit of, not just in terms of flood protection, but in terms of their overall plan for their communities in taking them forward.  I would say that in the increase from that £13</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">million to £148</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">million we have seen a big success story.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Cllr Jones:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> One issue I would have on this is that there are some flood defences that actually open up land for development and there should be an ability to claw back some of that increase in value to pay for the flood defences.  That will enable the money to go a lot further.  I do know that certainly the Secretary of State for Defra mentioned a scheme, I think in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Nottingham</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, where they put some flood defences up and it enabled a load of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">brownfield</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> land to be available for commercial </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">development</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.  It would seem sensible the uplift in that value should be translated in a claw</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#x2011;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">back</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> system to pay for further defences elsewhere.  We can get better at certainly the private-sector involvement in flood defences.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt;

font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Iain McKenzie:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The final question would be that we have already heard of the £148</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;

font-size:12pt">from</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> the private sector.  With that in mind, how can more private-sector funding be encouraged and hopefully secured?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dan Rogerson</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: In some cases, it might be around economic opportunity.  It may be around those who have an interest, as referred to by Mr Jones, in bringing land forward for development that is currently blighted by flood risk.  It might not be commercially viable to develop that, so there would be some benefit to people who are involved in future developments bringing them forward.  We have seen owners of factories and so on who want to make sure that their assets are protected make an investment as well.  What the Government is trying to do is make it easier, set out the formula that allows everybody to analyse what the benefit</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">s</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> are of investment—those in the private sector, local government and ourselves centrally on behalf of the taxpayer.  As the model has been seen to work, hopefully it will encourage others to come forward and take up those opportunities as well.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

this is something that the industry very much wants and the sector is taking forward and is committing to doing so.  I welcome the work that the ABI and all the insurance companies have made in coming to this agreement and in now working to make a deliverable solution, which will provide affordable home insurance to many people who have to labour under the blight of not being able to get that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt;
