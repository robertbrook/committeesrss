I suppose given that heat accounts for half the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> energy use, what should be the sort of over-arching goal of heat policy? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Liz </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lainé</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We would say start with looking at heat demand reduction before looking at the source of the heat, so Government policies at the moment are—well, our main concern is around the Green Deal and the extent to which that will incentivise heat demand reduction. It is a financial service. It is not going to incentivise action among consumers. It merely enables investment where people have already decided they want to take action to improve the energy efficiency of their home and reduce their building bills.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes.

I have here a simple set of logos of the type of accreditation schemes that our members have to be in, so Green Deal is just another accreditation scheme. They already have to be in things like Gas Safe to fit gas boilers, which is compulsory. They see it as just an administrative burden and therefore have largely not participated in the Green Deal, and as they are the people who by and large appear at your house for a distress purchase of a boiler, they should be there promoting that and they are not.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sansom</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I would add that I completely agree with your comments about the need to focus on energy efficiency and getting demand down, but it seems almost unavoidable that we have to consider a massive upgrade of our infrastructure. If we are effectively removing gas infrastructure, which provides the bulk of heat, and it is going to be picked up by electricity or potentially heat networks, then we are talking about a massive amount of infrastructure replacement that we need to consider. We need to plan for that as well, because it will take quite a long time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Liz </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lainé</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Could I also underline the particular needs of people who live off the gas network? People who use heating oil are paying half as much again as gas consumers, and LPG consumers are paying double the amount that gas consumers are paying for their heating, so there is a particular need for consumers off the gas network to address their costs.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q2 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I declare an interest, I am one of them, but what are you proposing we do about it?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Liz </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lainé</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: In terms of incentivising different heating fuels, we would look for a particular focus on those consumers. That has been included in the development of the Renewable Heat Incentive—that that is focused on consumers who are off the gas network.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">David </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Frise</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: If I might contribute to your first question, Chairman, as well, I think that we have a new system here. We must think in a system here of demand reduction, of how that is met by an array of energy supply, about how new technologies come through and help avoid </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">things like the rebound effect, which is where humans do not perform as you might anticipate, so how we use technology to help that; about how we use Government policy measures to incentivise and proactively encourage change, while also exploiting things that are driven by commercial interests or by just managing your own energy bills and things like that.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Then, as we have done with the Olympics, as is happening elsewhere, we need to be clear about the system of factors that are in play, to put those into some sort of system that does not prescribe how things are done, but it describes the outcomes we are seeking, so outcomes-based rather than being prescriptive. Then that pulls through all sorts of innovation and new ways to do things that you can learn from over time to address the needs of the system. But there is clearly a lot to do here, a lot to learn about that has not been done before.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q3 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> What sort of outcomes?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">David </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Frise</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There are three. One is around cost, so that is a key outcome that we want to try to get a handle on: how do we do this cost-effectively as energy prices are rising around the world? How do we do it in a way that is secure, that meets the needs we have for our energy system for the country into the future? Also with the commitments we have around carbon, how do we do it in a way where those two other factors and the carbon thing come together, so that we also save carbon? So there is a new system in play.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q4 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Would you say that the Government was adopting a systems approach?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">David </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Frise</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The state of the art here is quite weak, because I do not think anybody knows what the solutions are and I think we can do better, and we need to do better—whether it is the Government, the private sector or house-owners or whoever—on understanding the system, learning what works and what doesn’t and why, and improving. You are probably not going to get the system of factors absolutely right for a few years, because we need to go through the learning process.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Liz </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lainé</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: In terms of the system, what we think is lacking for consumers is the very beginning of the process and the end. To mention the Green Deal again briefly, when I first saw the process maps for the Green Deal, there was no mention of what the triggers are and I do not think we ever came to that point where Government said, “These will be the triggers for demand”. So where is that bit of the system? Then, right at the end of the system are the running costs and the controllability of heating. 70% of homes don’t have a full set of heating controls and we estimate that if you did implement those, you would save almost as much carbon as can be saved in ongoing loft insulations, so there is substantial potential there for carbon savings and direct bill savings.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q5 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So the heating controls would also be saving, as you say, the actual consumer money, so what is missing?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Liz </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lainé</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: What is missing? I do not know whether it is at the moment that building regulations require controls, but there are no </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">useability</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> requirements and it is a sort of fit and forget approach. Consumers are not necessarily advised. We asked as part of the smart meter rollout, or as part of Green Deal advice or ECO advice, that consumers be given advice—or maybe even default settings put into their controls—from some basic questions about how they use their house and when they are in. We were told that the energy advisers cannot do that, because they cannot be expected to understand or know how to use all programmes, but </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I think if an energy professional cannot use a heating control, how can we expect consumers to use them?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">David </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Frise</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: What we have basically is a system where we select a series of products, by and large at the lowest price, which closely approximates the design. This is particularly true of new housing, and then nobody checks that it delivers on that, so the point we are both making here is about focusing on the outcomes—for example, did it deliver, not what you said it would do, but did it do it?—but the whole system is predicated on believing that it did what you said it would do, and nobody goes back and checks.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I have a new property at the moment and I cannot get it to operate.

We have been very electricity-focused for understandable reasons and, for example, if you take the Energy Bill, it almost exclusively focuses on electricity. Heat is hardly mentioned, transport is not mentioned at all and it is very difficult to see how you can ignore heat, which is likely to be the subject of enormous conversions as heat is electrified or other forms of heat systems are added to the system. If we do not consider heat with electricity, we end up with sub-optimal systems, so it is not just vertically from source down to consumer, it is also horizontally across the energy sectors. We would add in transport—that transport, heat and electricity should be considered together.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Bonfield</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: If we look at the progress that has been made over the last five to seven years, the Department for Communities and Local Government set a policy requirement called the Code for Sustainable Homes, which you may be aware of, which set the factors that you need to think about when you are designing a green home. It had energy efficiency, it had materials embodied impact, it had water—the array of factors to think about without prescribing what was to be done. What has happened over a period of time is that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">housebuilders</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, notably two of the major—or top six—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">housebuilders</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, have looked at how they build their buildings, their homes, and come up with more energy-efficient ways of building them, which retains heat or keeps heat for cooling, improves the quality of the home, and then you can start looking at how you use new technologies and things to generate renewable power.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In effect, that is now reflected in the building regulations that are coming out next year, where for the first time the energy efficiency of the fabric as well as the CO2 arising from the building is included. The outcome of this means that the homes we have are less leaky, they </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">have fewer gaps between windows and blocks and other things, so they are intrinsically more heat efficient as well as being energy efficient without adding cost, or adding very little cost, because if you do that in the right way, you cut out wastage of contractor time on site, you cut out wastage of materials, you can build in a shorter time, so you have less capital deployed.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Again, what we have in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, arguably that is at the leading edge of countries around the world, is an increasing awareness and understanding of how to build better to be more heat efficient. Therefore, when you come back to your demand suggestion at the beginning—reducing demand—there are quite practical ways of doing that first, which then put less burden on the electricity supply or </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">heatpump</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> systems or other things that are needed to supply the energy to supply the heat. If we can build on some of the things that are in the code, new building regulations will help too, because they will require people to think about the quality of what they build. That is helpful, but then of course by 2050, more than 70% of our buildings have already been built, so the big challenge—and we started off with some statistics around where heat comes from—is, what do we do with the existing buildings to help them also be more heat efficient?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q6 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley: </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We have seen written evidence that retrofitting insulation to old buildings, while essential, is very expensive and alone is unlikely to cut demand by more than 40%.

If you are talking about loft insulation, it is another relatively low-cost way of improving the energy performance of your building. I cannot give you statistics on what the pay-back periods are for that, but they are okay. I can send you some information on precisely what the pay-back periods were.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> That would be very useful.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Bonfield</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: They are proven ways of improving the insulation of the home. The challenge now, and some of the things that the Green Deal is focusing on and ECO, is how we deal with the harder to treat homes, so homes where you have a solid wall structure. We have millions of homes in the country built in Victorian times, wonderful homes to live in, beautiful homes to live in, but often quite leaky from a heat perspective. What do we do with them? Then, when you start looking at how you insulate them, then there is more challenge because partly it is aesthetic, and if you live in a lovely Victorian home, putting insulation on the inside—you might not be able to put insulation on the outside for planning reasons or heritage reasons—can take away space and also ruin your lovely décor.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">If you look at the types of systems available now, some are fairly cost-effective, which can be relatively thick insulation forms. Then there are new ones coming into play, for example, there is a new product that was used to insulate space suits called </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">aerogels</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, which is very energy efficient or very good at insulation, and you can potentially have it much thinner, but at the moment the costs are very high. When you get volume coming through, the potential cost will come down. But there are costs and other blocks, if you like, for insulating solid wall, hard to treat homes now. Over time, as energy bills rise, and no doubt because Government policy measures and things encourage practice and learning, the costs will become better understood, the quality of delivery of the solution will improve and things will be better.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q7 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> But how do we get the costs down before we have committed huge expenditure to using the high-cost method to clad our homes or insulate our homes in the vague hope that in the process, it will become cheaper for other countries to take on the technology?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Bonfield</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I imagine what will happen is, as has happened before, Government help and incentives to drive progress, as there are at the moment, help subsidise the learning.

The learning comes through, the need for skills and training comes through and the private sector becomes more able to deliver cost-effective solutions. They have gone through the learning journey and investment journey. Of course in terms of a pull for it, as energy prices rise, that provides more market pull—whether you are a house owner, whether you are a real estate owner or whether you are a local authority or a school headmaster or headmistress—to spend more of your capital investment in energy efficiency measures, because it pays off.

That has to be the answer, because at the moment, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> energy policy is to decarbonise the electricity network so that you can then install </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">heatpumps</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, which are a carbon-free solution to that. We are in a halfway house because we are not there with windmills, with nuclear build. We are going to biomass. We have to rely on the gas network for longer and other fuel sources, so there is a period when we are going to have to deal with those properties and we are going to have to insulate them.

That is particularly important, because local authorities and Green Deal providers are able to run reports from the housing stock database that is held by Landmark. If that is not up-to-date, people are going to start getting approached with offers that just are not relevant, because they have already had measures undertaken.

The Renewable Energy Directive will not allow that to be included, so I think part of our recommendation is that we try to lobby to get that included, because it is a sensible thing. You have the heat, put it back into the ground so you have a better store for the winter—it makes sense—and cooling for the summer, which in new build houses is a bigger problem than heating. Heating loads are reducing very rapidly. Hot water demand is the biggest load and cooling is an issue in the summer.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q14 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Whitehead:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The only problem with cooling in the summer I guess is the extent to which one might wish to encourage a national regime of potentially more intensive cooling, even if it has a consequence in subsequent heating.

Some buildings will need cooling because of what they do in the building, not just domestic properties, but commercial properties. They will need cooling because they have significant heat loads within the building as well as solar gain.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Bonfield</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Or just because it is warm in the summer and they are more efficient, they are less leaky in terms of airflow, they are more difficult to cool, not because of any heating load, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">just because that is how they are now designed. Getting the ventilation right and, while you are designing for having an efficient heat requirement in the winter, also thinking about how it would work in the summer is important, otherwise the risk is you end up bolting on air-conditioning systems and things like that to keep cool. So the ventilation element of this is important to get right too, and for health. You do not want to be building or retrofitting buildings that do not have the right air circulation that negatively impact on people’s health. There is a risk if you do not think about the system that that is an outcome. That is why the building regulations are important, because they deal with the wake effects or the unintended consequences of needing to do something about energy efficiency, for example.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Also life safety—what are the potential life safety impacts of putting insulation in homes or other buildings for </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">firefighters</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and for occupants? We need to think about that in the system. It does not mean we do not do it, you just have to think about how you best manage it in the system. That is why I again come back to my starting point, which is that it is difficult to think of what the outcomes are, but if you can think about the outcomes and have a system against which people innovate, you are much more likely to get the right results than if you try to pick things off and be very prescriptive about how things are done.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">David </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Frise</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There is another element to this, which is planning requirements, so on top of building regulation requirements, there is usually a planning requirement for some onsite generation, so that is when you see solar thermal panels or solar PV panels on the roof of a building or inappropriate technologies used—typically heat pumps on the gas grid in social housing so they can trigger funding because they need to do that to get planning. You get this tick-box mentality and you are selling products and nobody is checking whether that product that you have installed works within a system. All these systems only promise energy and carbon savings if they are properly installed and maintained, otherwise they fail on that promise.

There is a lifestyle change thing happening here as well, because we have an increasingly ageing population, some of whom are working but they may be at home for longer. They might find low-grade heat that is supplied through the day, something that is more comfortable; whereas many other people are having longer days, more time away from the home and wanting to come back and give things a quick blast so it feels comfortable. That is important. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The other factor is—again, picking up your point—about how you use thermal mass and how you design that in sensibly so that the building has a way of regulating itself. That is another option. Then the final thing is, as these energy meters and things are installed at scale across the country, the opportunity for feedback that comes on to your smart phone and things like that that helps you control in a simple way what you have. That is what happens with these phones, isn’t it? We all find ways of using them. I think that will change things. I don’t think there is one answer.

Clearly, if there is a role for a distribution system, you can start thinking about things like biogas or synthetic gas, other forms of gas that could be used on the distribution network.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q18 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Is it possible to store high-grade heat for industrial purposes or is that too much of a challenge?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sansom</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is not my area of expertise, but I do know it is a challenge.

In the retrofit market, they are a difficult sell because you have to either upgrade the radiators or install under-floor heating—not desperately practical in a property—in order to make them operate properly.

There are three important factors. One is how the building is designed or how it is retrofitted or how the systems are maintained. That is important for non-domestic. The second thing is how the building is managed. How competent and capable is the facilities manager in operating the building? You have to learn. The third impact is around human behaviours. Heat and the need for heat or the need for cool is materially impacted by how people behave and what is starting to happen is that measurement of those three factors is starting to occur.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">My company has developed a product called </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">BREEAMing</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Use that allows those three things to be measured. That is being used now by real estate owners who are non-public sector across Europe because they want to look at their capital investment plan to think how they not only spend now on making the place look good with paints and new doors and carpets but what they invest from their capital budgets to ensure that they are getting green outcomes, because greener buildings can be worth more, which is good for balance sheet, and can cost less to run, which is good for P&amp;L. Then, having done that, how do you make sure you are getting the return on your capital employed? By having competent facilities managers running it. Then, what is it we need to do to the people who are in the building to help them perform in a way that keeps the building cool or warm? So they are three factors and I will probably stop there.

The normal air-conditioning load on a building like that would be quite high but, if you look at it, you have slots cut in the wall, in the cladding, which bring air through and if you look under your seats, when you sit there, you will see little slots there, too. The designers for that building combined passive ventilation, which draws air through for cooling mainly, along with a much lower air-conditioning load than you normally have to create a building that really performs and it did perform because we have lots of world record times.

We have seen increasing demand in our members to install and quite a lot in new build. Back to my flat in Surrey, summer temperatures of 34 degrees centigrade and the calculation that they use, your SAP calculation, says, “Solar gain: Thames Valley, negligible”. Well, we are south-facing full-glazed. It does not take a genius to work out that can’t be true, but we could get away with this if we had some solar shading or something else passive rather than installing air-conditioning. The default, I fear, will be to install a little package unit on each apartment, pretty much, which is a nonsense.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Bonfield</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: This is going with the design. Being sensible about the design and how you use natural things to keep cool or warm is important and then to think about what the method is. The other thing that is happening in domestic and housing is there is more use of mechanical ventilation heat recovery systems, which basically ventilate the building and transfer either heat or cool from either incoming or outgoing air to retain heat or retain cool.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q31 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Christopher Pincher:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> I appreciate that over the term of that building’s use you can reduce energy costs by implementing these things, but what sort of cost are you building into the building when it is built and, therefore, the cost to purchase? Is it significant or is it—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Bonfield</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: That is a helpful question because, of course, what happens with a lot of these measures in the beginning is it costs more money and then what happens over time, like with the homes built against the Code of Sustainable Homes, you value engineer. You find ways of doing it more cheaply. One of the problems we have with public procurement at the moment is it is very much focused on first costs not whole-life costs. The difference between building a BREEAM excellent school and a non-BREEAM excellent school is tiny, whereas the operating and energy savings for heating are very significant. So something that allows capital first costs and whole-life costs to be better considered when we are spending money is important. It would be helpful in getting the right sort of long-term measures built into buildings that will do something about reducing heat and associated energy needs.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Liz </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lainé</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The benefit of some of these passive mechanisms is there is very little additional cost. High thermal mass can just be denser concrete blocks. You are still using the same brick. You use the same skills for the buildings, but there is not a huge amount of additional cost; whereas maybe companies would prefer to put in air-conditioning and that will need different skills and different qualifications. It is just valued differently, I think. Sometimes gadgets have a higher value to people.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Bonfield</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The maintenance is important. It is quite interesting. In some of the research we are doing, you put some of these things in and they work very well but you have to change the filters right and you have to make sure they are in the right part of the building. Again, these are not insurmountable problems at all. You just have to think about them in the system and innovate and share the learning and the skill set so that they work as intended.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">David </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Frise</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: We see an awful lot of poorly-commissioned buildings because commissioning programmes traditionally get compressed from six weeks to six days to six hours in some cases, and what it forgets is that we build a new product every single time. We do not build like cars. Each one is unique and you have to learn because the client also does not use the building the way they said they would use it when you were designing it. There is a good programme called </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Soft Landings</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> that allows the user and the installer and the designer to work together to optimise the performance of the building and you should regularly re-commission the controls because things change and you learn. There are self-learning systems, all of which will mean that the building performs as the design. There are some figures from </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">CarbonBuzz</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> where I think buildings are 1.5 to 2.5 times off design—the performance gap is how we are looking at it now—and much of that is about fit and forget instead of saying, “We need to continually focus on how the building is performing and how we adjust the controls to make it work”.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Bonfield</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: If I might add to that. One of the things I hope the Committee will support is, as we get lots of data from individual buildings, now with IT and systems we can draw that </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">back in and learn from it, model it against what was predicted, tailor it out through </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">iPhones</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and things like that to individual user needs and get the outcomes we are seeking. Otherwise, the point you have raised, you could have great design and all the right intent but the outcome is not what you get because humans simply do not perform as you expect. The opportunity for us now, the real need and opportunity, is to recognise that problem and use meters and other systems to bring data back, push it back out to those who need to change their behaviours and then try to get the outcomes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Liz </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Lainé</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: In terms of a data collection meter, it is important to also ask the residents how comfortable they are finding the house. One of my concerns with the Green Deal and whether people are getting the savings that they have been promised is that it is very easy for the providers to say, “It is down to consumer behaviour”. We have to ask the consumers how they have found it to live in the house, because if the work has not been done properly they will explain, “No, we have to sit in this corner of the room because the windows are still so draughty”, or something. That will not appear on any data monitoring. It is important we talk to residents about their experiences.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">David </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Frise</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There is an excellent Government programme at the moment based around building information modelling, which is a revolution that is coming into construction where you can model a building, and Government, very sensibly, have tied it in with </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Soft Landings</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. They are saying, “There is your model. You have built it, however you have built it—maybe off-site, maybe on-site or whatever—and we are going to tie you in to see how it works”. That is a sensible thing and the hope, and I think it is working already, is that that drives it into the private sector as well so you get good practice flowing through a Government programme. That is to be welcomed.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">              </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Robert </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Sansom</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I was going to add a point to the price of heat as well as cooling and that is that heat must be treated as a local type issue. When you do that, you can take advantage of things like natural sources for cooling or for heat, wasted heat and opportunities for storage—shallow reservoir storage for example. Again, this is probably one of the key roles that a local authority can have in terms of it understands its area, understands the people who live in the area and often is in a better position to make those sort of decisions.</span></p><p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q32 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Christopher Pincher:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Can I just finish off very quickly? You rightly say that human reaction to designing a building can skew data. Obviously local authorities have a role in providing useful local feedback. What about the role of central Government in affecting the way buildings are designed? For example, the Renewable Heat Incentive does not apply if it is thermal energy storage, does it? Does that affect that particular technology and its development and rollout?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">David </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Frise</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It has greater impact through things like building regulations than through something like that on the Renewable Heat Incentive.

It was mentioned earlier that heat has not really been considered generally by a lot of energy policy. I suppose a system approach to energy really is starting with the users and where they are, the householder in the middle of an urban area or an industrial park. You need to look at where they are and what their needs are and then find the best way to meet their overall energy needs as opposed to having a series of silos, one for electricity, one for gas, one for energy efficiency. You need to look at the whole site and find the best way to meet those needs. In terms of policy, the silo nature of policy probably has prevented that system approach. As we look to a more decarbonised energy system, which will involve more electricity use, that probably will make for a more expensive system unless we can break down those silos. It is the interplay between, for example, heat demand, which will partly come to electricity, and normal power demand that needs to be addressed.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Richard Lowes</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I certainly agree with Tim on the consumer point. Consumers have been very much overlooked in heat policy and strategy. If you look at the long-term projections for the rollout of heat pumps and district heating, the difficulty you get with those major system changes is how you get people to sign on to it and get them to pay for it. It is a very difficult question for Government. There is also a question around the wider system. We are seeing greater interaction now between the gas and electricity systems, with the power to gas that was mentioned earlier, with storage issues and also changes to the transport system with the potential for gas-powered vehicles as well as electric-powered vehicles.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Peter </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Hamnett</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think the challenge for heat is the same as the greater energy challenge. It is decarbonisation, energy security and cost effectiveness. As Tim said, again it is how heat plays into that as part of the solution—it is not a separate issue.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Hawkey</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think it is worth thinking about a systems approach in terms of what that means. A system is a collection of components arranged in a certain configuration, and part of a systems approach is thinking about what that configuration is and how that impacts on the overall outcome as well as what the individual components are. There is a wide range of interactions across different technologies that could be influential on </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> energy systems broadly. There are interesting examples where there is greater deployment of district heating in other countries, such as </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Denmark</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, where district heating plays an important role in balancing electricity systems. Thinking about systems in this way creates a bit of a challenge because the configuration of a system is something that could evolve autonomously or it could be something that is planned to achieve certain objectives. Thinking about district heating systems, there is a question as to whether the deployment of district heating takes place as a patchwork of small networks or whether larger networks are deployed that bring certain kinds of economies of scale and scope. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There are important questions around the systems approach to do with how certain </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">configurational</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> outcomes are achieved and there is a question mark there around the role of Government in setting out that vision or enabling that to form a co-ordination to achieve those kind of system-wide impacts.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q35 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> We are going to come on to district heating and CHP, but you say, “What is the role of Government?” We wondered whether you had an answer to that question.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Hawkey</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: If the role of Government is restricted to reconfiguring the market-based incentives around the deployment of particular technologies, under that kind of scenario Government is not playing much of a role in determining the configuration of the system that emerges. That is being left to market forces and it is not clear that those market forces would achieve configurations that have the cost, environmental and fuel poverty outcomes that are desired. That is the negative case. There is a wide range of options for what the positive case for the role for Government could be. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Taking a spatial approach to policy development, particularly around heat, would help there and there are various ways in which that can be done, the extreme example being the Danish experience where the Danish Government mandates local authorities to carve up parts of the map and determine that particular energy systems would be deployed there. That is highly effective but is something that might be quite difficult to envisage in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. There are other more intermediary approaches. I think in written evidence I mentioned the Norwegian system for licensing district heating systems, which in effect grants concessions to operators of district heating networks to exclusive rights to operate district heating in a particular area. That gives them a degree of business stability and confidence that enables them to expand into that area and have a planned expansion. It also gives comfort to the subscribers to that network that they are subscribing to a network that has received a certain degree of endorsement. What I am trying to say is that there is a wide range of options that are worth exploring and the key is that there is a spatial dimension to the way that policy is developed.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q36 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Can you get a system-wide approach from Government when there are so many Departments of Government that are probably necessary to be part of that system?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rotheray</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: It is the age-old problem, isn’t it, the joined-up Government?

I think we have to. If we start to look at the cost of the system that we will end up with without joining up, then we need to make sure that we can. We have to put those structures in place within Government so that policy development happens in that way otherwise we will end up with quite a costly system. Heat particularly, as was noted by Robert earlier, is very much a local issue. If you don’t up end up with your joined-up series of policy areas, a lot of opportunities will be missed. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">I know of an example where there is an industrial site that as part of the industrial process uses a lot of high temperature heat, but they have heat that is rejected to the environment. They can’t use the heat, they can’t return it to the system, and it is at 90 degrees centigrade. They would be happy to provide that kind of heat to buildings that were going to be built just next door but there is no system approach for ensuring that that happens. There needs to be a way in which policy can capture that value because that heat is currently not being captured. Instead, we will just see gas boilers going in and that is totally unnecessary. The cost argument should be the driver for ensuring that we do deliver a joined-up policy.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Peter </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Hamnett</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think it is worth considering just how relatively nascent the district heating industry is in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.

It is a very nascent industry here and there is an enormous gap up to the technical potential and the economic potential that can be delivered. That is costly at the moment because it is nascent. The installation market is so young and immature and there is no competitiveness there. I think it is expensive now to install but there is enormous potential that is genuinely technically and economically viable.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q37 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Whitehead:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> There is enormous potential. It looks very viable in terms of the efficiencies and the way that the combination of gas and electricity and recycling of heat and so on works, but it does not always work, does it? What would you say are the circumstances under which CHP does and does not work?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Peter </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Hamnett</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I will take district heating networks as a part of that question first, and that is not necessarily just CHP. There are many different technologies that district energy can use. The network itself doesn’t really mind. It is indifferent as to where the heat comes from. There are a number of low carbon technologies and low cost technologies you can use, but the networks themselves are most viable in what we call high heat density areas. The concept is that there is a high amount of heat use for any given area. This has been measured academically in a report in 2009 and they came up with this idea that if there is, I think it is 3,000 </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Kw</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> per square kilometre, then it is viable. If there is not that heat density, it is not. Much more subjectively, it can work if you have a high concentration of users, such as a city centre, or if there is a number of residential tower blocks together. It is not going to work if you have row after row of detached housing, put very simply. District energy is no panacea but there is huge technical potential that is currently unfulfilled nonetheless.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Hawkey</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Another aspect of where district energy works best is where not only do you have high heat density but you have diversity of heat loads, so you are not just serving particular peaks in the day but when some buildings require energy it can be supplied and then at other parts of the day other buildings can be supplied. That then leads on to another one of the key challenges, and in a way it is a challenge of system thinking. Often when you have heat load diversity, that is achieved because you have different kinds of heat user, which means that you have multiple organisations connected to the same heat network. If there is an established heat network and you are trying to bolt on some additional users, that is more straightforward than the case where you are trying to establish a new system, and trying to develop an agreement among these different organisations is a key challenge. There are windows of opportunity that open up. It relies on persistent skilled negotiation in a context where there is not a standardised approach, so it is done on an ad hoc basis, and in which no organisation has clear responsibility to do this, so it requires unusual leadership, very often, from individuals within particular organisations to try to make that happen.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Richard Lowes</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: District heating works best in densely populated areas but in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> the most densely populated areas are places with gas networks already in place. The difficulty you then have is can you switch people who are on gas, which is the cheapest and most efficient source of heat that we have at the moment, on to something that is centrally controlled, you don’t have as much control over your prices and is potentially more expensive, depending on how it is subsidised? There is very much a question of whether you can switch those consumers over to the district heating network in the first place and they don’t have to accept it. If you do not have that critical mass there for people to connect to the network, it is not going to make financial sense for a developer.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rotheray</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There were two parts to your question. There was a heat networks question and a CHP one. All of the points that have been made on district heating are valid and there are some tricky questions to be addressed but they need to addressed. Particularly on CHP, it is very important to separate the infrastructure of a heat delivery system, be it a steam network in industry or a heat network in a town, and the generation kit, so CHP, a heat pump, solar thermal or whatever. The reason that CHP is good—and most people that you meet generally say it is good—is because it is a very efficient way of making heat and electricity. It is more efficient to do it in one process than to have a power station over here and a boiler over here. You save between 10% and 30% of energy, so that is why it is worth having. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">It works really well in industry. 70% of energy use in industry is heat, 20% of our total heat use is in industry and it is 32% of the CO2 emissions. Industry is a real area where we need to look at decarbonising heat and it is really hard because, unlike other technologies like solar thermal and heat pumps, you can’t make steam with those technologies so you have a limited choice. CHP is basically the big energy efficiency step change that you can make in industry. About a third of the chemical sites, most refinery sites—</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Grangemouth</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> that has just been in the news is fed by a major CHP plant. Interestingly, when they were talking about the barriers in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, one of the key points that was cited by the chief executive there was rising energy prices. This year we have seen that the industrial CHP plants across the UK have had a two to three times greater tax rise than all the other fossil plant on the system as a result of the carbon price floor and the removal of levy exemption certificates, and it is really start to hurt industry. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">At the time that we all say we need to maximise energy efficiency, we have Government policy, the carbon price floor and the removal of this exemption, that has hit CHP hard and it has created a really negative investor sentiment in terms of new CHP investments. We are all talking about we need to improve the efficiency of British industry but if Government policy undermines that kind of investor confidence then it is going to be a struggle to get new CHP built. One CHP plant at the Isle of Grain came on in 2013 and it was expecting to receive incentives until 2023. It received them for one year. That is going to make those investors think hard about whether it is worth investing a second time round. We are approaching a point where significant new CHP investment is going to be needed because a lot of industrial plant are coming to the end of their lives. They need to be reinvested. I think one thing for the Committee to consider is whether there needs to be something to sort out that loss of incentive, because it has had a very negative impact.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q38 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Whitehead:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> You have mentioned the question of the most efficient use of CHP and the concentration of heat load. One of the issues is precisely that question of the efficiency of CHP in providing a constant base load. Where you have a relatively variable base load, the tendency of CHP may well be to </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">overspecify</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and therefore to under-optimise the plant use. Do you think that is a—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rotheray</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: In industry, CHP broadly operates base load. If you wish to, you can make CHP power output exceedingly flexible. In district heating where CHP, certainly in the near term, is going to be the driver for district heating networks, it is really important that they are properly specified. Energy storage is going to be a key behind that because otherwise you do risk </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">oversizing</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> plant.

As the grid decarbonises, that comparison becomes less favourable. There is an important issue there of what is the role of gas CHP outside of industry. If it is positioned within a systems approach whereby gas CHP, because it is a proven technology, because financially it can stack up in the short term, that can support the development of heat networks that then future proof cities to all sorts of other kinds of heat sources being deployed that would be lower carbon. That would be a far more desirable outcome than a series of small patchwork networks that are not large enough to support the economies of scale for those other kinds of technologies and so lock into gas CHP.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q40 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Whitehead:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> The issue is steam, isn’t it, what produces steam and puts the stuff into the network and how efficiently that is done?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rotheray</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: For industry, you mean?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Whitehead:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Yes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rotheray</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Industrial heat temperature.

What is your view on that? What is your view on the potential rollout of micro CHP? Some people have claimed you can have 30 million micro CHP boilers installed over the next 20 years.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Richard Lowes</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: There are two issues for micro CHP, and the other one is micro fuel cell CHP I think you were referring to. The </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">capex</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> of the actual investment is 10 times as much as a gas boiler potentially. Although you can incentivise through the feed-in tariff to run your micro CHP, as a consumer proposition, spending that much money when you could have spent £1,000 on a gas boiler, is not very appetising for a consumer. The other issue is that the efficiency and the carbon savings from the micro CHP are very dependent on the property it is used in. The most suitable properties for micro CHP are big leaky houses because you only get the overall efficiency and have the high heat load in a house that has quite a high heat demand. That is when you get the low carbon electricity produced. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The potential number of situations where micro CHP would save carbon are limited. However, that is not to say I don’t think it is something that should be investigated and encouraged more because there are only a few thousand of these that have been installed in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> so far. They are more efficient systems and they can be made to be very good. It is certainly not going to fix every gas boiler and make every gas boiler lower carbon but it is something that should be investigated. Some of the next generation gas appliances that we are seeing come on to the market, such as gas heat pumps that are very similar to electric heat pumps but use a gas fuel source to heat ammonia rather than using an electric generator to compress refrigerants, are going to be probably much more efficient and in the next five to 10 years they will be the key area for growth in gas industries. They are not currently incentivised and that is something that we would support because whichever way heat policy goes, there are going to be quite a lot of people on the gas network.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rotheray</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: The key thing is the right thing in the right place. If you think about micro CHP, it is the next stage on from a condensing gas boiler. A condensing gas boiler went from 80% to 90% in making electricity, so the efficiency calculations don’t come out in the same way but you basically get another step change in efficiency. There probably has been quite a lot of talk about when the market is going to really develop. The big challenge, if you talk to the people who are manufacturing it, is basically moving from batch production to mass production, and that will be the thing that triggers the falling cost. There is no doubt at the minute they are fairly high cost. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">The other thing that is worth thinking about is we tend sometimes to see 2050 and assume that we should only do something now that is compatible with the energy system of 2050. We do have to transition, so progressive energy efficiency measures are extremely valuable. You want to avoid a high carbon lock-in but you do have to ask the question how quickly is the electricity grid going to decarbonise and how often do I change my boiler. My boiler is not a 40-year asset. It is designed for 10 or 15 years or whatever it may be. So there may well be a significant role to play in terms of using those bits of equipment.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q42 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Whitehead:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Assuming we are going to have gas around for quite a long time in the future.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rotheray</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes.

It is gas biomass and then I suppose carbon capture and storage in the medium term, but for homes as well gas will be important, particularly in the suburban area where there are real options.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Chair:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Can I just remind the Committee of my entries in the Register of Members’ Interests of the oil and gas industry and in particular a share holding in Shell?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Richard Lowes</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: If I may add to Tim’s point. If we look at the history of energy policy for heat, which is about three years long so not very much, and you compare that to the history of electricity—we have had renewable subsidies for 10 years now, non-fossil fuel obligation way back—there has been a lot of learning for renewable electricity that has allowed it to inform policy decisions and incentive structures going forward. It almost feels like decisions are being made on incentivising particular technologies, whether it is a heat pump or something else, but we do not have the evidence base yet to make those decisions. It feels like there is probably a few more years of learning. I think the Renewable Heat Incentive is the tool to do this, but there are a few more years where we need to learn how the appliances work, what their is impact on the network, what their is impact on consumers, before you can start making decisions about the longer term. There is a target of 2050, but I don’t think we are yet able to determine what 2050 actually looks like for a national heating system because we don’t know what all the technologies look like that make it up.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q43 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Whitehead:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Turning to district heating networks, they are not new and indeed heard mention that they are far more extensively deployed in a number of other European countries, although in some European countries they were deployed in a very inefficient way and have been effectively taken out. What are the costs and benefits of district heating networks, particularly in terms of the cost of installing a new network and taking the consequences of that?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Pet</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">e</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">r </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Hamnett</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: In answer to your point during that, district heating networks are not new. No, granted, they are not new as an idea but the piping technology that is installed is relatively new in the context of the district heating networks we have in this country. There may have been many networks put in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">in</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> the 1950s, for example, supplying social housing but many of the piping systems used there are now effectively defunct whereas the piping systems that are being put in the ground now are pre-insulated, extremely high efficiency, very low heat loss, very resilient and very long lived. That really ties into this future proofing aspect of that heat network. You may use gas-fired CHP or maybe biomass or another technology now that is the best available economically viable technology to use. Once that network is in the ground, it is going to last many lifetimes of your central plant so you can effectively do a bit of a heart transplant if you will. You take out that old technology once it has hit the end of its life and you put in the new best available technology and you continue to progressively decarbonise the whole area that way. Instead of relying on individual consumers to do piecemeal action every time a bit of plant dies, you are wholesale decarbonising all of these consumers with one fell swoop really. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In terms of the cost benefits, the cost of the networks is high. This is definitely one of the biggest barriers at the moment. DECC commissioned some very good work on barriers to delivery of district heat networks, and I am sure we will touch on it later that the Heat Networks Delivery Unit at DECC is intended to address a large number of those barriers. The one that is not addressed is the cost of the heat networks. We submitted a written </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">response that included figures along these lines but it can cost anywhere between £800 and £1,500 per metre of network to install this, so it is very high intensive capital investment and it is a very long term investment, therefore. To make this viable you have to look at it on a whole life cost basis and that is something that a lot of people do not necessarily want to do so you have to look at clever business models to make sure—</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q44 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Dr Whitehead:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Is that a question more of long-term investment and known payback and the kind of investors in district networks rather than a disincentive per se? As you say, it is a bit like building a port and you will change from people unloading ships by hand to large cranes on container vessels but the port is still there. Is it just a question of a mind-set on the investment rather than particular incentives?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Peter </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Hamnett</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes, I think so. There are certainly successful people who have used these business models that work, and </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Southampton</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> is a great example of that in particular, as you well know, where this scheme has been running for over 25 years now. That initial investment has certainly been recovered but then there is continuing more investment as that network grows. It started with just a deep geothermal well and the civic centre in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Southampton</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> as the first consumer. Now there is over 40 consumers across the city and there is a large scale use of CHP as well. It saves in the region of 10,000 tonnes of CO2 per annum for this one scheme. That is impressive when you consider where it came from 25 years ago and also how that has been replicated across a number of different local authorities utilising very similar or the same business model. If you look at the UKDE members, as much as district energy is nascent in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, we have schemes in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Birmingham</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Coventry</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Exeter</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, Leicester, Liverpool, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Manchester</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, Milton Keynes, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Newport</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Newcastle</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, Nottingham, Sheffield, Shetland, Southampton, Woking, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, using not just CHP but energy from waste and biomass and many other technologies.

Southampton has a policy whereby new developments in the city, where it is economically feasible to do so, must connect to the district energy scheme unless they can do something themselves on site that is at least as good in terms of carbon emission savings. The developer is free to do what they want as long as it is at least as good as the district energy connection. What we see is the business case for connecting to these district energy schemes, where it is done in the most appropriate manner in the most appropriate places, is that it is the developer or the consumers of the heat that save money. Their costs of heat are less than the all-in costs of heat from a conventional system. There is no green premium there where these schemes are done correctly and therefore people are incentivised to connect.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Hawkey</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I would like to add one thing in terms of the cost structure of district heating systems. As Peter said, it is very upfront costs within a long period to recover that cost, which makes the financial viability highly sensitive to the rates of return that the network is required to achieve, which then relates to questions about how it is financed and what the governance systems around it are. That broader distinction between whether the public sector plays a leading role in developing, governing and financing these kinds of systems, in which case the returns required are generally lower, which I suppose increases the scale of the potential and also creates possibilities to move networks into areas that from a commercial perspective might be less lucrative but have the benefits that policy is trying to achieve, particularly around fuel poverty and expanding the deployment of low carbon heat. An important issue to bear in mind is that it is not just the cost but it is the return that is required.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rotheray</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Local authorities currently have the legal right to require developers to put in measures that go beyond existing building regulations, and that has been a key driver for the uptake of district heating. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> basically has a whole plan based on looking at the system as a whole and then finding the most cost effective way of delivering a lower carbon and more efficient energy system. That has driven a lot of interest in heat networks. They have those planning abilities within their system. I think the key to it is that it has to be planned but it also has to deliver value to the user. The user needs to have better value heat. That is really important. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There is quite an interesting study that has just been completed for the GLA by </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Buro</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Happold</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> that looks at opportunities for recovering waste heat. They say there is enough waste heat in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> to provide all of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’s heat needs. The question is really about accessing it, taking it from existing sources like the environment and the river or taking it from maybe the Tube, data centres, hospitals and so on. If we can capture that, you can deliver good value heat. An example I have seen just recently is at the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Royal</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Free</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Hospital</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">.

They pulled it down to 120, took that heat and shipped it over the wall, and it is now providing low cost heat to vulnerable customers in social housing that will stabilise their heat costs and they will not be so concerned now about heating costs that will have been controlled. Also it provides an income stream to the hospital of £1 million a year, so it is a real win </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">win</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. It is planning but also you have to think about delivering value to the consumer.

If you want to get to scale, I think DECC are talking 20% or 30% of heat coming from heat networks by 2050. That is 10 million, 15 million homes, potentially. To get to that sort of scale, I don’t see how there can be anything other than a centralised approach to delivering heat networks.

I am not suggesting that with such a nascent industry we want to do down that route but it is interesting that they are not supposed to consider heat and that is part of our tradition of where we have come from the silos.

I think this is a natural next step, to be absolutely frank. You have just highlighted the reasons why it does not look after heat is because in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s it was a central electricity generator and we do not have this system. That is something that we should look at when we talk about reform of the regulator. I raise this specifically to this inquiry. The earlier contributions brought examples from other countries. The question I have to ask on that, before I come on to implications for our gas and electricity grid, is was there a retrofit in many of these countries, like </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Norway</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, or did they start from scratch?

To do that for heat networks would be a mistake. One of the things that we as an association, with industry and Consumer Futures and others, have been working on is developing an independent heat customer protection scheme, which we have just launched as a consultation, as a way to help investors in heat networks find them more investable because they know that consumers under such a system would have protection because it is not regulated, and also to ensure that consumers are willing and able to be informed about signing up to joining a heat network. We want to ensure that their prices are fair and transparent and that consumers have access to the kind of information that they have if they are on the gas or electricity network, and that is available now.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q50 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Albert Owen:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Moving on to the implications for the British grid, as I read Government policy going forward, we have the electricity market reform, decarbonisation of big electricity generation, and the electrification of surface transport in the future and also of heating systems and reliance on imported gas, and shale obviously.

Fundamentally we expect change. We have seen reductions in demand over the past few years of around 15% off what people have been using. None of that has been caused by people switching away from gas to anything else. That has primarily been caused by cost increases and energy efficiency. We are already seeing a reduction in demand and I think we expect to see a continued reduction in demand.

We believe the biggest driver is cost and people have just been turning down thermostats or using their heating less. We expect the reduction in demand to continue until </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">energy efficiency is rolled out, depending on how far it is rolled out. What we definitely don’t envisage at the moment, certainly in the next 10 years or so, is people switching away from the gas network to go to electric forms of heating or to district heating. Fundamentally, they are going to remain more expensive, as far as the models show, forever and there is going to have to be some kind of incentive that is big enough to pull people off gas on to something else or an incentive on gas that is big enough to drive people away from gas. So we don’t really see a reduction in the scale of connections to the gas network in the short to medium future and even in the long-term future it is difficult to see that happening. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">We were a partner in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Poundbury</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> project, which was the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">’s first commercial </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">biomethane</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> project.

These people are forgotten people. You are talking about people we hear about, and will this afternoon from the energy companies about dual fuel and these great savings you can make by buying from the same company, but that does not apply to a lot of the country. I am suggesting if we are going to have this massive shift then we should be investing in some of these periphery rural areas where people want to live but are finding it very difficult to heat their homes because they don’t have cheap gas, as there is now, but they also don’t have cheap alternatives to gas.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Richard Lowes</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I completely agree and one of the things that we are asked as a company is, “Can you connect us?” That is the main thing the stakeholders say, “Can you extend the gas network?” and that is completely in the face of Government policy, which is to move people on to electric and district heating, off grid, and there is huge room for cost reduction and carbon reduction, innovation in heat pumps off grid, absolutely.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q54 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Albert Owen:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Any comments on the future of the grid, electricity and gas, if we are starting moving towards combined heat and power?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rotheray</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: For the electrification of heat—and there is going to be some of that—the challenge for the actual structure of the grid and the physical asset is very large and almost always underestimated. Peak demand for electricity currently is about 55 </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">gigawatts</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. Peak demand for heat is seven times that. So if you electrify all heat you will end up with a massive network if you don’t do any kind of mitigation. The thing that is mitigation is storage. If you think about transport, we store the energy in our fuel tanks. If you think about gas homes, we </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">store it in the pipes. One of the key things that was picked up in the earlier session is we need to think about storage. At a household level for off gas grid homes, I think the Renewable Heat Incentive has a clear driver for driving that particular sector of the economy but also of improving efficiency. We know that things like micro CHP with LP gas is something that is coming on. There are key things that need to be done there. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">In urban areas, I think it would be unwise to try to pit these technologies and these networks against each other. Heat networks clearly have a role to play and they are very valuable in terms of particularly thermal storage. If you put thermal storage on a heat network its flexibility is very much greater and you can do a huge amount to facilitate a much leaner electricity network. But the idea that we are going to completely move away from the gas network is something we will struggle to deal with, particularly especially when you consider about those high temperature processes in industry. We may see less gas in urban areas; there is clearly a role for it in suburban areas. We are going to have a mix and we have a tendency to always want a silver bullet. The reality is this is a very heterogeneous kind of set-up and we are going to have to have a range of technologies and infrastructures.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Peter </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Hamnett</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I support entirely what Tim said there.

How are we going to encourage more of the district heating systems? We are not really having the answers to that at the moment. If gas prices continue to rise as they are, many people are going to be priced out of the gas markets in the future if it carries on like it is. There is the reliance and it is not that secure in some of the places we get it from. What is the Government not doing quite right now that people are not going for the combined heat and power systems? Is it down to regulation or planning? Are local authorities just sitting back and doing nothing in this country whereas in other countries they are more proactive?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Peter </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Hamnett</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I think there are certain local authorities that are very proactive, there are certain local authorities that are not; there are some in the middle that might want to be but don’t really know where to go, and the Heat Networks Delivery Unit is meant to help that third class. How you drag along those that could do something but don’t is maybe a more contentious and difficult question. Celebrating those schemes that have already succeeded, those local authorities, those areas that have already succeeded, is something we can certainly make more of in this country. In terms of the near future, look at schemes like the Renewable Heat Incentive. It has certainly already started to have a change on those district heating schemes that are going out there. There are more district heating schemes based around biomass, for example, but it is still fundamentally more difficult to deliver a renewable district heating scheme compared to just a renewable piece of plant in a single building. It is more expensive, it is more problematic, there is more paperwork to do. It is a pain, frankly.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Hawkey</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: In terms of that question about what are local authorities in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> doing, there are some who are working very hard on these kinds of issues. The historical restrictions on what local authorities are able to do under the ultra </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">vires</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> principle, which is unusual in Europe, and the lack of direct service provision that local authorities find themselves in is the context they are in now, because we have moved to this model whereby local authorities generally enable others to provide services rather than provide them themselves. What I was talking about in </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Sweden</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, where municipalities could co-ordinate the heat demand, is much harder in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. That leads on to thinking about why it is that we end up with this quite </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">piecemeal approach in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">. An important aspect of it is that it is so difficult, even among public sector organisations, to negotiate an agreed approach to developing a heat network, because very often it is seen as something that is done on an ad hoc basis. Advice from consultancies and contractors is often very difficult to compare with each other. I think that is one of the issues that the Heat Networks Delivery Unit is intending to try to support local authorities through. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">There is also a question on whether it makes sense at this stage to try to encourage the whole of the population of local authorities to be proactive in this space or to direct energies on those local authorities that are doing something, given the economies of scale that attach to district heating networks.

We have discovered something new. What about the Energy Intensive Industries Compensation Package? It has always struck me as slightly odd that people who use a lot of energy are protected from the penalties that we impose on people who use a little energy. Do you think that is sensible? Does it work? Is it a good thing?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rotheray</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: I am very happy for others to comment but I imagine that I may be one of the few that deals with industrial energies. That compensation package is really for electro-intensive users. It is designed for people who use a large amount of electricity, and 70% of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">industrial energy use is heat. I can understand why that compensation package has been proposed and it is to do with the fact that these are trading on international markets. Particularly the carbon price floor is a unilateral tax in the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> and it has no impact on prices outside of the </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">UK</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">, so it does risk making British industry less competitive. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Germany</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> does the same thing. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">Germany</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> reduces their taxes on heavy industry because of their international competitive nature. There is genuinely a question about industrial heat users and what they can do. We incentivise low carbon energy generation, don’t we? We provide things like the renewable obligation and so forth. For energy use we use sticks, so we just use taxes. The idea of incentivising industry to do more efficient things is something that we generally don’t think about. Maybe we need to think how can we help industry be part of a more efficient, lower carbon solution as opposed to saying, “You use too much energy, you must reduce, you must reduce”. At the end of the day, a lot of processes require a certain amount of energy for them to operate.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q64 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> So there are heat intensive industries that are not protected by this compensation package? </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rotheray</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q65 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> Which would they be?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rotheray</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Petrochem, chemicals, paper, food and drink and ceramics would be the top ones that spring to mind.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:36pt"><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold">Q66 </span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Mr Lilley:</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt"> There was recently some package announced for ceramics, was there not?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 14.2pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Dr </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">Rotheray</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:12pt">: Yes.
