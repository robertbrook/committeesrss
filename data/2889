The Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) is also still at an early stage of development and will only be introduced for the domestic sector next year. We feel that a strategic context is vital to maintain a focus on the aims of promoting microgeneration (to reduce carbon emissions, diversify and increase our UK-based energy generation portfolio and make energy more affordable in future) and to monitor whether the FiT and RHI schemes remain fit for the purpose of achieving those aims. It also provides accountability to the public and promotes monitoring and public reporting on the growth of microgeneration which can help to articulate the rationale for government policy in this area.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The FiT and RHI mechanisms were designed to help microgeneration technologies reduce their costs more quickly at an early stage in their development. The rapid growth of the market for PV illustrates how quickly conditions can change within embryonic markets. Maintaining a strategic oversight of the development of the market for microgeneration will help government to react early to new barriers to deployment, or indeed rapid advances that reduce the need for government intervention.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The newbuild market is hugely significant for the growth of microgeneration in future, however the private sector component of that will not be greatly influenced by FiT and RHI as house builders are unlikely to be system owners so will not be incentivised. Engaging local authorities with the national strategic context for microgeneration has, through policies such as the “Merton Rule”, (requiring 10% on-site renewable energy on new developments) led to greater certainty for investors in microgeneration about the level of demand in future. Eroding the statutory basis for this type of policy could damage confidence in the microgeneration sector.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">Maintaining the Secretary of State’s responsibility to promote and report on the development of microgeneration is likely to be especially important in the light of the following developments within the energy sector which represent opportunities and constraints that may not be significantly affected by FiT and RHI:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold">UK electricity infrastructure</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The strength of the UK electricity infrastructure is already becoming a significant constraint to the deployment of microgeneration in some areas, as the network is already at capacity. This will become a much more significant constraint as the deployment of microgeneration increases due to FiT and RHI support (note that network capacity is a constraint on deployment of heat pumps in areas where the network is weaker, due to their electricity demand). At the same time substantial investment is needed in the UK electricity </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">infrastructure to cope with current and future demand.
