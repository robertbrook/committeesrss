all of which can cause additional safeguarding and welfare concerns when dealing with already vulnerable LAC.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">When LACs are placed out of the area, they can be exposed to multiple risk factors he moment that they leave their home.   There are many challenges that are bought with these issues and agencies within the District are working hard together to overcome them, but the need continues to increase due to out of area placements and the transient nature of some wards.  The level of LACs that are in the District, combined with the growing number of out of area placements, cause significant concern for the local statutory.  A key issue for ourselves and the other statutory agencies within Thanet that are involved in community safety is that we are denied access to placement information on the basis of data protection by those that have it, meaning that we are unable to ensure that risks within these areas are tackled appropriately. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri;

font-size:11pt">Prior to 2009, Thanet had 22 residential children’s homes in the District.  Three were closed down, and there are currently 19 residential children’s homes still operating in the District.  Although we are aware of the number of homes in the area, because Ofsted own this information we are unable to pinpoint exact locations due to Ofsted being unwilling to give this information on the grounds of data protection.  We are also unable to determine the number of independent fostering services in the District; those operating are under no obligation to tell us that they are doing so.  We are currently working with them to progress our knowledge in a co-ordinated manner; again, this information is owned by Ofsted who will not disseminate it further.  This is the same situation for support services in Thanet provided for LACs after they leave care.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

we are concerned as to whether the London boroughs are being comprehensive enough in their assessment and rationale when they are placing LAC out of area.  </span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">We also do not feel that the proposed reforms are sufficient in relation to the involvement of District Councils in two tier authority areas.  Thanet District Council is not responsible for Children’s Services and therefore is more often than not left out of the loop when vulnerable children and young people are placed in the District.  Given the complex and high risk issues that are within many of our most deprived wards where the children’s homes tend to be located, there needs to be a greater liaison and opportunity to input for the District authorities.  There have been occasions in which County are unaware of other serious issues within Thanet and have agreed to the placement of children in highly unsuitable areas due to a lack of communication or acknowledgement of the information that the District Council may hold.  There are also incidences of out of area children being placed in the area that County Children’s Services are not aware of due to it being an independent children’s home and we have only been made aware of their existence ourselves via a child protection concern made to one of our staff members about the home by one of these children.  When placing vulnerable children it is vitally important that </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt; text-decoration:underline">all</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> agencies serving the area have the opportunity to feed information into the risk assessment of a home and are able to provide their own knowledge of any issues or potential issues within the locality.  It is also important that the background of the children already residing at a home is taken into account within risk assessments.  Due to the placement of some out of area LAC into our most deprived, high risk communities there have been increasing problems regarding child sexual exploitation and missing children.   </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;

text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">We also feel that fostering services should be subject to the same stringencies upon their services as children’s homes are, particularly regarding safeguarding, risk assessments of placements and independent monitoring.  As well as the issues that we have due to out of area placements, Thanet also has high numbers of independent fostering services and those that are classed as “support services” – there needs to be greater legislation put in place to ensure that these services are regulated and monitored. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt;
