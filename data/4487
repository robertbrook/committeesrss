In terms of confidence in the reforms the MOJ should give consideration to actively seeking specific data rather than relying upon publically available sources. If it is the case that savings have not been made or that they have not been made at the level it was suggested the </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">reform would achieve then members are of the view that potentially both the MOJ and Insurance Industry must be called to account.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 72pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">2.4</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">It would equally appear that there has been little effort to develop any form of collaborative approach to tackling fraud for example by the sharing of database information such that claims would not be pursued from the outset were firms in possession of all relevant information. There has been no reasonable justification put forward by Insurers for the withholding of that information. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">The issue of transparency is addressed by Mr Grayling in his letter of the 21</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:7.33pt; vertical-align:super">st</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt"> November 2013 but whilst he recognises that a lack of openness will cause behaviours to be questioned any decision to take action with regard to improving the position would appear to be delayed pending the outcome of the Competition Commission’s investigation. The opinion expressed by LLS members is that this is inadequate in terms of taking simple steps that could expedite resolution of the perceived fraud problem. Equally should any consultation about the need for greater transparency and information sharing be limited to talks with the ABI and industry regulators that consultation will lose the ability to consider and react to the recommendations made by the practitioners who deal with the problem at a coal face level. </span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 72pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">2.5</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">With regard to fraud and pre-medical offers the members of LLS note that this practice continues unabated and indeed is an increasing trend that contributes to the ability of fraudulent claimants to secure compensation payments. </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">To this end if the MOJ Officials are as suggested by Mr Grayling arranging meetings to discuss this practice with relevant stakeholders LLS would seek confirmation that the stakeholder group will be wide ranging in the parties that are represented and indeed would welcome involvement with that consultation given the prevalence of civil litigation within the Merseyside area.</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 36pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic">December 2013</span><a name="_GoBack"></a></p><p style="font-size:11pt; line-height:115%; margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
