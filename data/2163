These will be referred to below as ‘The UK Minerals Industry’. The other sector is commonly referred to as the major mining houses.  These companies only have corporate offices in the UK and do not have any extractive operations in the UK or the EU.  In the majority of cases, they are not British companies.  These companies have UK offices and are listed on the stock exchange &amp; AIM because London is seen as the mining investment centre of the world as well as the commodity centre.  In addition there are a number of consultancies which specialise in the extractive sector and have a global reputation.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt 5pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:10pt; font-weight:bold">1)</span><span style="font:7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">What is the contribution to the UK economy of extractive industries in the UK? </span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt 5pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The UK Minerals Industry typically produces about 350 million tonnes of minerals per annum, directly contributes over £10 billion a year to the economy</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt 5pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The Government publication ‘Resource Security Action Plan’ stated ‘It is essential that there is an adequate and steady supply of raw materials for infrastructure, buildings and goods that society, industry and the economy need’.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt 5pt 21.3pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">It is not just the contribution to the total UK economy that is important.  Minerals occur where they occur.  Invariably these are rural areas and sometimes in areas of natural beauty.  Therefore extractive industries are important for rural economies and employment.  Two examples of this are Cleveland Potash and York Potash in North Yorkshire.  Potash is an important fertiliser for agriculture.  As the global population grows so will agriculture.  In addition it is used in glass-making, chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Therefore there is an increasing demand for potash which is seen as becoming the industrial mineral equivalent of gold and become a globally traded mineral.  Other major sources of the mineral are Canada, Germany &amp; Russia.  However both Cleveland Potash and the proposed York Potash mine are sources of </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">polyhalite</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">, which is seen as having benefits over potash.  Cleveland Potash contributes to the UK economy by selling a large proportion of its production overseas and thereby bringing in foreign income, whilst the proposed York Potash operation is expected to sell most of its product overseas.  Cleveland Potash supports the local rural economy by using many local small suppliers and service companies.  York Potash mission statement is to do the same.</span></p><p style="margin:5pt 0pt 5pt 21.3pt;
