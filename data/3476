Example from our practice: A young person aged 14 in out of authority provision requested advocacy support to resolve issues around his education. In his previous placement he undertook work in Maths and Art towards GCSE level but the coursework was not transferred to the new placement and therefore the young person was unable to complete work towards the qualification. He felt this left him at a great disadvantage in terms of achieving qualifications for his future. The issue could not be resolved informally and so a formal complaint had to be made. The young person said ‘My current placement is supposed to offer in-house education. There are very few provisions in terms of books and work and I am only accessing a limited number of hours of education a day. I would like to complete work towards official qualifications and to have access to more education in terms of hours and support.’ </span></p><p style="margin:6pt 0pt 0pt 28.35pt; text-indent:-28.35pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:bold">3.6. </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:bold">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:bold">We believe that the reforms to children’s homes should be underpinned by a wider programme of reform to improve placement stability for children in care and ensuring a greater focus on and scrutiny of how the needs of individual children are met.</span></p><p style="margin:6pt 0pt 5pt 35.45pt; text-indent:-35.45pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">3.</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Attitudes of professionals to older children missing from care and/or at risk of child sexual exploitation (CSE)</span></p><p style="margin:6pt 0pt 5pt 21.3pt; text-indent:-21.3pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10.5pt">4.1.

We believe that the recruitment and employment for children’s home staff should be subject to minimum qualifications obtained before they start employment. Two years is a long period of time in a child’s life. Considering the vulnerability of children in care, particularly those placed in children’s homes and the variety of support needs they have, it is not acceptable for them to be supported by staff </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:bold">who</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:bold"> do not have relevant training and qualifications.</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10.5pt"> Research shows that the current quality of training (or lack of relevant qualifications) is a contributory factor in the failure of some children’s homes to properly safeguard children in their care. Recent cases of child sexual exploitation involving children in care demonstrate this all too well. </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:bold">There should also be an expectation that current employees in the children’s homes sector will obtain the relevant qualifications within the specific time frame of this provision coming into force.</span></p><p style="margin:6pt 0pt 5pt 35.45pt; text-indent:-35.45pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:bold">4.6.

Where an applicant disagrees with the assessment made by a local authority, a judicial review of the decision, and the court's determination of age binds both parties. However, removing the right to access legal aid prior to being referred to the NRM in order to challenge a decision by a local authority will mean trafficked children are in a powerless position where they are unable to challenge an incorrect age assessment and will therefore not be recognised as a child. This means they could remain homeless or be accommodated inappropriately, supported insufficiently, and be placed at risk of harm, detention and deportation.</span></p><p style="margin:6pt 0pt 5pt 35.45pt; text-indent:-35.45pt"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10.5pt">8.6.</span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10.5pt">              </span><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:10.5pt">The APPG report into children missing from care contained a number of recommendations focussing on the needs of trafficked children.
