I can say with absolute certainty that is the easiest examination that I have ever taken and that if </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:12pt">you as a Committee were to take the 17 Edition GOLA exam then I believe that a number of you would actually pass.

In 1966 when I started work my first year was spent in a Pre Apprentice Training School and we were required to spend 4 weeks on a number of  different trades before selecting which apprenticeship to take. During the 4 weeks on the electrical trade we were expected to wire up a ring main, a lighting circuit with a 2 way switch, do basic calculations for cable sizing and carry out basic testing. (This was in 4 weeks as a 15 year old). Since 1966 very little has changed to domestic wiring systems other than the colour of the insulation has changed twice to standardise with Europe, the metrication of the cable sizes to comply with SI units, the addition of an earth bonding lead to the metal box and the addition of PVC earth sleeving on the bare earth conductor. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">I hope this illustrates that the technical knowledge and expertise required for domestic wiring is at the bottom end of the skills that any electrician would have and it is not complicated. Domestic wiring is as simple as it gets!</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:12pt">Given the above it is unlikely that any electrician, unless they were completely incompetent, is going to fail the site inspection. Can I suggest that the Committee investigate how many actually do fail the site inspection.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:12pt">Once you are Part P Accredited the notification process is an absolute joke. It requires a Part P Accredited electrician to go on line and fill in a form with the name and address of the customer, a description of the installation, and the name and address of the Building Regulation Authority. There is no requirement to give any more information other than any reference number that the electrician may have given a particular job. The Accrediting organisation then send out a notice to the customer to say that their installation has been tested (the customer should already </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:12pt">know this because the electrician should have given them a copy of the test certificate) and a similar notice to the relevant Building Control Authority. I suspect that these documents are actually automatically computer generated from what the Part P electrician types in. To put it in context. My wife has a holiday business which rents out holiday apartments. I do the electrical work in these apartments whenever it is required. We work from the same office with desks side by side. When I complete an installation I test it and give her a copy of the inspection and test sheets and keep a copy in my records. I then go on line and record the fact that I have completed an installation with the Accreditation Organisation ( I have to pay for this each time) they, or possibly their computer system, then send notice to my wife at the next desk by post telling her that I have completed the installation and tested and commissioned it. They don't send her any test data because they just don't have it. How has that added anything to the process?</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:12pt">I am sure that because I am 62 years old and we live in a Society that is ruled by the young who know it all you will think that I am just an old fool. But I assure you that I have a detailed knowledge of what is going on that is very different to what you have been told by those with a commercial vested interest in the current system continuing. I have no commercial interest in sending this evidence/report whatsoever my only interest is in exposing the ridiculous situation that exists.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:12pt">I would like to suggest that what is actually required is a simple registration system for electricians and a law which says that to undertake electrical work you have to be a registered electrician. This is what most western countries have.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:12pt">All that is required is a central register held by the Government (Not outsourced to some private commercial organisation) which the public can access.
