Their work with Manchester City Council demonstrates that 25pence in every £1 of procurement spend was re-spent in the City through local workers and a local supply-chain. If this impact was achieved across the £172m in LA spend in England, Wales and Scotland this would result in £43m being spent in the local economy of the purchasing authority. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">In their forthcoming JRF-funded report CLES argue the case for measuring the local multiplier impact of a LAs expenditure as a basis for protecting and expanding opportunities for local suppliers in LAs procurement processes e.g. by providing better information on opportunities, reducing pre-qualification requirements, encouraging `capacity-building` with local firms.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The forthcoming Macfarlane report uses information in a HM Treasury Report </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Accelerating the SME economic engine </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">(</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The Glover Report 2008) which identifies an additional important barrier for many local companies:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">Aggregation (combining similar requirements into a larger contract) and `bundling` (putting together different requirements into a larger contract) results in contracts that are beyond the scope of SMEs (and especially micro and small enterprises, including most social enterprises) to deliver e.g. because they don`t have the financial backing or track record.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The report emphasises the importance of introducing `lots` into the procurement of contracts.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:11pt"> </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">This</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt"> allows LAs </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">and joint-purchasing groups </span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">to aggregate or `bundle` their demand but potentially disaggregate the supply, while still achieving `best value` through a competitive procurement process.

Positive local multiplier outcomes can be achieved without increasing the opportunities for people that are disadvantaged in the labour market e.g. by recruiting local skilled/experienced workers and using local suppliers that recruit from a wider area. The  `disadvantaged` can include long-term unemployed people (many of whom will have poor educational achievement and skills), people leaving full-time education and training, young people leaving the case system,  people with a disability and those returning from ill-health or caring responsibilities. Not all of these are residents of areas of deprivation, but many people in deprived areas are affected by one or more of these characteristics. A key question for people that are disadvantaged in the labour market is how they can progress in a context where they have to compete with many experienced/skilled job applicants within a travel-to-work area that can, in some trades, now cover the whole of the EU. </span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Both the original (2002) and the forthcoming reports highlight the support of the European Union in using procurement to address social issues:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.35pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic"> “Contract performance conditions are compatible with this Directive provided that they are not directly or indirectly discriminatory and are indicated in the contract notice or in the contract documents.

Guidance is provided in the 2002 and 2008 reports referred to above: essentially the contractor is required to deliver the social benefits by working with a named agency that targets its activities at specific areas or communities. So for example, in the Birmingham City Council approach contractors have to notify all vacancies to the Council`s Employment Access Team (EAT) and work with them on the recruitment of employees and trainees. The EAT then works with over 100 local employment agencies to identify suitable candidates and creates a shortlist that maximises opportunities for residents of the Council`s priority areas: those with highest levels of deprivation. This maintains `a level playing field` between local and non-local bidders while still allowing the Council to achieve its objectives as set out in its Procurement Policy for Jobs and Skills.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The case studies demonstrate the benefits of such an approach:</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><ul type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt"><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Library of Birmingham: 306 jobs, including 82 apprenticeships, have been created, of which 54% were taken by residents of `priority areas`;</span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">Glasgow Housing Association (GHA) improvement contracts: 1158 apprentices and trainees delivered 11.4% of the labour time required to deliver the contracts, with 48% of the opportunities going to  residents of  the most disadvantaged areas in Glasgow; </span></li><li style="font-family:Symbol; font-size:12pt; margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.52pt; padding-left:7.48pt; text-indent:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">South Glasgow Hospitals: working with Jobs and Business Glasgow the contractor has recruited 379 `new entrant trainees`, with priority to residents of South Glasgow and then the whole of Glasgow.</span></li></ul><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">These examples provide evidence that procurement can be used effectively to target opportunities at residents of the most disadvantaged areas.

Key issues are the removal of legal barriers that are perceived by procurement teams as increasing the risks of including social value in LA procurement, and greater use of mechanisms that will maintain a local supply-chain and help people in disadvantaged communities overcome the barriers they face in using the labour market to sustain a life for themselves and their families.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; text-decoration:underline">4.1 Simplifying the legal powers</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The Macfarlane report identifies the range of powers that LAs need to utilise in order to include social and community benefits across a large part of its procurement. It is not straightforward and the Public Services (Social Value) Act may have made matters more difficult: by providing a duty and power in relation to just a small part of what LAs procure the impression may be given that Government doesn`t consider that social value should be sought from other procurement. This adds to the risk-averse approach already taken by many LA legal advisers and procurement teams.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">This can be overcome by extending the duties and powers provided by the Social Value Act 2012 to all services and works procurements. Since the Act only requires LAs to consider whether they could achieve greater social value there is no need for the Government to specify when this consideration must take place.

It is likely that the new EU Procurement Directive will specifically encourage the use of `lots` to provide opportunities for SMEs within procurement that maximises `value for money`. This may require procurement teams to incur additional costs at the procurement stage and possibly in contract administration, but these short-term costs should be balanced by the wider social value achieved and the longer-term benefits of having a vibrant local supply-chain.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt; text-decoration:underline">4.4 Supporting LA employability work</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">The biggest threat to the use of LA procurement to target opportunities at communities with high levels of disadvantage is reducing the employability teams that are the interface between employers with targeted recruitment and training obligations and job-seekers in the most disadvantaged communities that most need the opportunities.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p><p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:12pt">A key characteristic of these LA teams is that they have a policy of targeting the neediest within their area.
