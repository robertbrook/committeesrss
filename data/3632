I have been a cyclist in London since the 1970s and still occasionally need to do so when passing through or visiting friends although I try and avoid it now as I consider it too dangerous.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">2. I cannot be bothered to formall</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">y set out a submission as per your Guidelines since just about everything that needs to be known about cycling safety is already known and to formally “answer” your questions is therefore a waste of time.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">3. I mainly wish to state my utter disgust at the p</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">resent situation where it is de facto legal to kill, maim, or threaten to do either or both of these provided that the victim is a cyclist (or pedestrian) and the perpetrator is driving a motor vehicle. This happens on a daily basis – much worse in my expe</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">rience in London than anywhere else in the UK – on all roads in the UK.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">4. I wish to state my disgust that the police refuse to take this issue seriously.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">5. I wish to state my disgust that you – our elected representatives refuse to take this issue seriou</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">sly.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">6. It is absolutely clear that if cycling safety is a priority for transport planners – and those tasked to enforce the rules - then cycling is not just safe it is the </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt; font-style:italic">safest</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> form of mass transport available to most people. When cycling is manifestly </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">not safe (the situation in the UK) then this means cycle safety is not a priority. That’s why it’s dangerous, that is why motorists are free to kill with (almost complete) impunity.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">7. So long as farcical schemes such as the utterly risible “Cycling Super </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Highways” are considered a source of pride by our civic authorities rather than the object of contempt and ridicule that they are generally understood to be – </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">by cyclists and non-cyclists alike in my experience – we are living in a country where many more </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">unnecessary deaths are absolutely certain.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">8. We are also living in a country where a completely unmeasurable number of people (but surely many tens or hundreds of thousands) have already been intimidated off the roads that they pay for in their taxes by t</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">he refusal to allow them their share</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> of access to those roads</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">9. The questions you raise (that I quote at the top of P.1) are so naïve, they reveal a depth of ignorance that makes your investigation almost certain to be pointless.</span></p><p style="margin:0pt 0pt 10pt"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">10. Thank you for your </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">attention, if you’ve bothered reading this far. If you want t</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">o know how to make cycling safe all you have to do is what every other British person who wanted an answer to the same question </span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">has</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> done</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt"> for the last 50 years</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">: go to a country where they have ach</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">ieved it already.
